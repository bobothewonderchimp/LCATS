      "{'name': ['Sherlock Holmes - The Adventure of the Copper Beeches', 'Sherlock Holmes - The Boscombe Valley Mystery'], 'body': ['\\n“To the man who\\r\\nloves art for its own sake,” remarked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside the\\r\\nadvertisement sheet of The Daily Telegraph, “it is frequently in\\r\\nits least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to\\r\\nbe derived. It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far\\r\\ngrasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have\\r\\nbeen good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish,\\r\\nyou have given prominence not so much to the many causes cÃ©lÃ¨bres and\\r\\nsensational trials in which I have figured but rather to those incidents which\\r\\nmay have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those\\r\\nfaculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special\\r\\nprovince.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And yet,” said I, smiling, “I cannot quite hold myself\\r\\nabsolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my\\r\\nrecords.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You have erred, perhaps,” he observed, taking up a glowing cinder\\r\\nwith the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to\\r\\nreplace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative\\r\\nmood—“you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life\\r\\ninto each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of\\r\\nplacing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really\\r\\nthe only notable feature about the thing.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,” I\\r\\nremarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more\\r\\nthan once observed to be a strong factor in my friend’s singular\\r\\ncharacter.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, it is not selfishness or conceit,” said he, answering, as was\\r\\nhis wont, my thoughts rather than my words. “If I claim full justice for\\r\\nmy art, it is because it is an impersonal thing—a thing beyond myself.\\r\\nCrime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon\\r\\nthe crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a\\r\\ncourse of lectures into a series of tales.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either\\r\\nside of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down\\r\\nbetween the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like\\r\\ndark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and\\r\\nshone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not\\r\\nbeen cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping\\r\\ncontinuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at\\r\\nlast, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet\\r\\ntemper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“At the same time,” he remarked after a pause, during which he had\\r\\nsat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, “you can\\r\\nhardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you\\r\\nhave been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of\\r\\ncrime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to\\r\\nhelp the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the\\r\\nproblem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the incident of the\\r\\nnoble bachelor, were all matters which are outside the pale of the law. But in\\r\\navoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have bordered on the\\r\\ntrivial.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The end may have been so,” I answered, “but the methods I\\r\\nhold to have been novel and of interest.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public,\\r\\nwho could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb,\\r\\ncare about the finer shades of analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are\\r\\ntrivial, I cannot blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or\\r\\nat least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As to my own\\r\\nlittle practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost\\r\\nlead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think\\r\\nthat I have touched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks\\r\\nmy zero-point, I fancy. Read it!” He tossed a crumpled letter across to\\r\\nme.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran thus:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“DEAR MR. HOLMES,—I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I\\r\\nshould or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as\\r\\ngoverness. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do not inconvenience\\r\\nyou. Yours faithfully,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“VIOLET HUNTER.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do you know the young lady?” I asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not I.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is half-past ten now.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember that\\r\\nthe affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first,\\r\\ndeveloped into a serious investigation. It may be so in this case, also.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for here,\\r\\nunless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was plainly\\r\\nbut neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover’s\\r\\negg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in\\r\\nthe world.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,” said she, as my\\r\\ncompanion rose to greet her, “but I have had a very strange experience,\\r\\nand as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice,\\r\\nI thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should\\r\\ndo.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I\\r\\ncan to serve you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of\\r\\nhis new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion, and then composed\\r\\nhimself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together, to listen to her\\r\\nstory.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have been a governess for five years,” said she, “in the\\r\\nfamily of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an\\r\\nappointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to America\\r\\nwith him, so that I found myself without a situation. I advertised, and I\\r\\nanswered advertisements, but without success. At last the little money which I\\r\\nhad saved began to run short, and I was at my wit’s end as to what I\\r\\nshould do.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called\\r\\nWestaway’s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see\\r\\nwhether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the name of\\r\\nthe founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits\\r\\nin her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an\\r\\nanteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers and\\r\\nsees whether she has anything which would suit them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as\\r\\nusual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout man\\r\\nwith a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon\\r\\nfold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose,\\r\\nlooking very earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a\\r\\njump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘That will do,’ said he; ‘I could not ask for\\r\\nanything better. Capital! capital!’ He seemed quite enthusiastic and\\r\\nrubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a\\r\\ncomfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You are looking for a situation, miss?’ he asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Yes, sir.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘As governess?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Yes, sir.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘And what salary do you ask?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I had Â£ 4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence\\r\\nMunro.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Oh, tut, tut! sweating—rank sweating!’ he\\r\\ncried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling\\r\\npassion. ‘How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such\\r\\nattractions and accomplishments?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you\\r\\nimagine,’ said I. ‘A little French, a little German, music, and\\r\\ndrawing—’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Tut, tut!’ he cried. ‘This is all quite beside\\r\\nthe question. The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment\\r\\nof a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted for\\r\\nthe rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history\\r\\nof the country. But if you have, why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to\\r\\ncondescend to accept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me,\\r\\nmadam, would commence at Â£ 100 a year.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an\\r\\noffer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps\\r\\nthe look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a note.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘It is also my custom,’ said he, smiling in the most\\r\\npleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the\\r\\nwhite creases of his face, ‘to advance to my young ladies half their\\r\\nsalary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey\\r\\nand their wardrobe.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a\\r\\nman. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great\\r\\nconvenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction\\r\\nwhich made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘May I ask where you live, sir?’ said I.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five\\r\\nmiles on the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear\\r\\nyoung lady, and the dearest old country-house.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they\\r\\nwould be.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘One child—one dear little romper just six years old.\\r\\nOh, if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack!\\r\\nsmack! Three gone before you could wink!’ He leaned back in his chair and\\r\\nlaughed his eyes into his head again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was a little startled at the nature of the child’s amusement,\\r\\nbut the father’s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘My sole duties, then,’ I asked, ‘are to take\\r\\ncharge of a single child?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young\\r\\nlady,’ he cried. ‘Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense\\r\\nwould suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always\\r\\nthat they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no\\r\\ndifficulty, heh?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I should be happy to make myself useful.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people,\\r\\nyou know—faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress\\r\\nwhich we might give you, you would not object to our little whim. Heh?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘No,’ said I, considerably astonished at his words.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive\\r\\nto you?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Oh, no.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to\\r\\nus?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my hair\\r\\nis somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut. It has been\\r\\nconsidered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand\\r\\nfashion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I am afraid that that is quite impossible,’ said I.\\r\\nHe had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow\\r\\npass over his face as I spoke.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I am afraid that it is quite essential,’ said he.\\r\\n‘It is a little fancy of my wife’s, and ladies’ fancies, you\\r\\nknow, madam, ladies’ fancies must be consulted. And so you won’t\\r\\ncut your hair?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘No, sir, I really could not,’ I answered firmly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a\\r\\npity, because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In that\\r\\ncase, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a\\r\\nword to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her\\r\\nface that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission\\r\\nthrough my refusal.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?’\\r\\nshe asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘If you please, Miss Stoper.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the\\r\\nmost excellent offers in this fashion,’ said she sharply. ‘You can\\r\\nhardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you.\\r\\nGood-day to you, Miss Hunter.’ She struck a gong upon the table, and I\\r\\nwas shown out by the page.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough\\r\\nin the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table, I began to ask myself\\r\\nwhether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all, if these people had\\r\\nstrange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they\\r\\nwere at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few governesses in\\r\\nEngland are getting Â£ 100 a year. Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many\\r\\npeople are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be among the\\r\\nnumber. Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the\\r\\nday after I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back\\r\\nto the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received this\\r\\nletter from the gentleman himself. I have it here and I will read it to you:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.\\r\\n“‘DEAR MISS HUNTER,—Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your\\r\\naddress, and I write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your\\r\\ndecision. My wife is very anxious that you should come, for she has been much\\r\\nattracted by my description of you. We are willing to give Â£ 30 a quarter, or Â£\\r\\n120 a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads\\r\\nmay cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife is fond of a\\r\\nparticular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress\\r\\nindoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing\\r\\none, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia),\\r\\nwhich would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or\\r\\nthere, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no\\r\\ninconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as I\\r\\ncould not help remarking its beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid\\r\\nthat I must remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased\\r\\nsalary may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child is\\r\\nconcerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the\\r\\ndog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train. Yours faithfully,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘JEPHRO RUCASTLE.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind\\r\\nis made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before taking the\\r\\nfinal step I should like to submit the whole matter to your\\r\\nconsideration.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the\\r\\nquestion,” said Holmes, smiling.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But you would not advise me to refuse?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a\\r\\nsister of mine apply for.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed some\\r\\nopinion?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle\\r\\nseemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his wife is\\r\\na lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be\\r\\ntaken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to\\r\\nprevent an outbreak?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is a possible solution—in fact, as matters stand, it is the\\r\\nmost probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for\\r\\na young lady.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, yes, of course the pay is good—too good. That is what makes\\r\\nme uneasy. Why should they give you Â£ 120 a year, when they could have their\\r\\npick for Â£ 40? There must be some strong reason behind.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand\\r\\nafterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I felt that\\r\\nyou were at the back of me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your\\r\\nlittle problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for\\r\\nsome months. There is something distinctly novel about some of the features. If\\r\\nyou should find yourself in doubt or in danger—”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Danger! What danger do you foresee?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHolmes shook his head gravely. “It would cease to be a danger if we could\\r\\ndefine it,” said he. “But at any time, day or night, a telegram\\r\\nwould bring me down to your help.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is enough.” She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety\\r\\nall swept from her face. “I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my\\r\\nmind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair\\r\\nto-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow.” With a few grateful words\\r\\nto Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“At least,” said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the\\r\\nstairs, “she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care\\r\\nof herself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And she would need to be,” said Holmes gravely. “I am much\\r\\nmistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was not very long before my friend’s prediction was fulfilled. A\\r\\nfortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her\\r\\ndirection and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely\\r\\nwoman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light\\r\\nduties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or\\r\\nwhether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my\\r\\npowers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half\\r\\nan hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the\\r\\nmatter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. “Data! data!\\r\\ndata!” he cried impatiently. “I can’t make bricks without\\r\\nclay.” And yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his\\r\\nshould ever have accepted such a situation.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I was\\r\\nthinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night\\r\\nchemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I would leave him\\r\\nstooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him in the same\\r\\nposition when I came down to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow\\r\\nenvelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Just look up the trains in Bradshaw,” said he, and turned back to\\r\\nhis chemical studies.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe summons was a brief and urgent one.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday\\r\\nto-morrow,” it said. “Do come! I am at my wit’s end.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“HUNTER.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Will you come with me?” asked Holmes, glancing up.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I should wish to.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Just look it up, then.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There is a train at half-past nine,” said I, glancing over my\\r\\nBradshaw. “It is due at Winchester at 11:30.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis\\r\\nof the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the morning.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBy eleven o’clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old\\r\\nEnglish capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down,\\r\\nbut after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them down and began to\\r\\nadmire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with\\r\\nlittle fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was\\r\\nshining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which\\r\\nset an edge to a man’s energy. All over the countryside, away to the\\r\\nrolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and grey roofs of the\\r\\nfarm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Are they not fresh and beautiful?” I cried with all the enthusiasm\\r\\nof a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Holmes shook his head gravely.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do you know, Watson,” said he, “that it is one of the curses\\r\\nof a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference\\r\\nto my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are\\r\\nimpressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which comes to\\r\\nme is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be\\r\\ncommitted there.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens!” I cried. “Who would associate crime with\\r\\nthese dear old homesteads?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson,\\r\\nfounded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not\\r\\npresent a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful\\r\\ncountryside.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You horrify me!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do in\\r\\nthe town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile that the\\r\\nscream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard’s blow, does not\\r\\nbeget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then the whole\\r\\nmachinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it\\r\\ngoing, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at\\r\\nthese lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor\\r\\nignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish\\r\\ncruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such\\r\\nplaces, and none the wiser. Had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to\\r\\nlive in Winchester, I should never have had a fear for her. It is the five\\r\\nmiles of country which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not\\r\\npersonally threatened.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Quite so. She has her freedom.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What can be the matter, then? Can you suggest no\\r\\nexplanation?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover\\r\\nthe facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can only be\\r\\ndetermined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for\\r\\nus. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that\\r\\nMiss Hunter has to tell.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance from the\\r\\nstation, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. She had engaged a\\r\\nsitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am so delighted that you have come,” she said earnestly.\\r\\n“It is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should\\r\\ndo. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Pray tell us what has happened to you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to\\r\\nbe back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning, though he\\r\\nlittle knew for what purpose.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Let us have everything in its due order.” Holmes thrust his long\\r\\nthin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no\\r\\nactual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to them to say\\r\\nthat. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my mind about\\r\\nthem.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What can you not understand?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it\\r\\noccurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in his\\r\\ndog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it\\r\\nis not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house,\\r\\nwhitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are\\r\\ngrounds round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes\\r\\ndown to the Southampton high road, which curves past about a hundred yards from\\r\\nthe front door. This ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all\\r\\nround are part of Lord Southerton’s preserves. A clump of copper beeches\\r\\nimmediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was\\r\\nintroduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no truth,\\r\\nMr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms\\r\\nat Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to be a silent,\\r\\npale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should\\r\\nthink, while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their conversation I\\r\\nhave gathered that they have been married about seven years, that he was a\\r\\nwidower, and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has\\r\\ngone to Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she\\r\\nhad left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As\\r\\nthe daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that her\\r\\nposition must have been uncomfortable with her father’s young wife.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in\\r\\nfeature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a\\r\\nnonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her\\r\\nhusband and to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered continually from\\r\\none to the other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible. He\\r\\nwas kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they\\r\\nseemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman.\\r\\nShe would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face.\\r\\nMore than once I have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it\\r\\nwas the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never\\r\\nmet so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small for\\r\\nhis age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His whole life\\r\\nappears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy\\r\\nintervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to\\r\\nbe his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning\\r\\nthe capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would rather not talk\\r\\nabout the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my\\r\\nstory.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am glad of all details,” remarked my friend, “whether they\\r\\nseem to you to be relevant or not.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant thing\\r\\nabout the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and conduct of the\\r\\nservants. There are only two, a man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name,\\r\\nis a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell\\r\\nof drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet\\r\\nMr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong\\r\\nwoman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They\\r\\nare a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the\\r\\nnursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of the\\r\\nbuilding.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very\\r\\nquiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered\\r\\nsomething to her husband.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Oh, yes,’ said he, turning to me, ‘we are very\\r\\nmuch obliged to you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to\\r\\ncut your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from\\r\\nyour appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you.\\r\\nYou will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so\\r\\ngood as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue.\\r\\nIt was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs\\r\\nof having been worn before. It could not have been a better fit if I had been\\r\\nmeasured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of\\r\\nit, which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for me\\r\\nin the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire\\r\\nfront of the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair\\r\\nhad been placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it.\\r\\nIn this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the\\r\\nother side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that\\r\\nI have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I laughed\\r\\nuntil I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of\\r\\nhumour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad,\\r\\nanxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked\\r\\nthat it was time to commence the duties of the day, and that I might change my\\r\\ndress and go to little Edward in the nursery.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly\\r\\nsimilar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and\\r\\nagain I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an\\r\\nimmense rÃ©pertoire, and which he told inimitably. Then he handed me a\\r\\nyellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow\\r\\nmight not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for\\r\\nabout ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in\\r\\nthe middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what the\\r\\nmeaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They were always\\r\\nvery careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the window, so that I\\r\\nbecame consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back. At\\r\\nfirst it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror\\r\\nhad been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the\\r\\nglass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I\\r\\nput my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see\\r\\nall that there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was\\r\\nnothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance, however,\\r\\nI perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small\\r\\nbearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The road\\r\\nis an important highway, and there are usually people there. This man, however,\\r\\nwas leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking\\r\\nearnestly up. I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find\\r\\nher eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am\\r\\nconvinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what\\r\\nwas behind me. She rose at once.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Jephro,’ said she, ‘there is an impertinent\\r\\nfellow upon the road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?’ he asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘No, I know no one in these parts.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion\\r\\nto him to go away.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Surely it would be better to take no notice.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly\\r\\nturn round and wave him away like that.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down the\\r\\nblind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in the\\r\\nwindow, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Pray continue,” said Holmes. “Your narrative promises to be\\r\\na most interesting one.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be\\r\\nlittle relation between the different incidents of which I speak. On the very\\r\\nfirst day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small\\r\\nouthouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the\\r\\nsharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Look in here!’ said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit\\r\\nbetween two planks. ‘Is he not a beauty?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague\\r\\nfigure huddled up in the darkness.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Don’t be frightened,’ said my employer,\\r\\nlaughing at the start which I had given. ‘It’s only Carlo, my\\r\\nmastiff. I call him mine, but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who\\r\\ncan do anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so\\r\\nthat he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and\\r\\nGod help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness’ sake\\r\\ndon’t you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night,\\r\\nfor it’s as much as your life is worth.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out\\r\\nof my bedroom window about two o’clock in the morning. It was a beautiful\\r\\nmoonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and\\r\\nalmost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the\\r\\nscene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the\\r\\ncopper beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It was a\\r\\ngiant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle,\\r\\nand huge projecting bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into\\r\\nthe shadow upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart\\r\\nwhich I do not think that any burglar could have done.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you\\r\\nknow, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the\\r\\nbottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse\\r\\nmyself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little\\r\\nthings. There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty\\r\\nand open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two with my linen, and\\r\\nas I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use\\r\\nof the third drawer. It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere\\r\\noversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first\\r\\nkey fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one thing\\r\\nin it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It was my coil of\\r\\nhair.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and the\\r\\nsame thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon\\r\\nme. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With trembling hands I\\r\\nundid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair.\\r\\nI laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was\\r\\nit not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it\\r\\nmeant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the\\r\\nmatter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening\\r\\na drawer which they had locked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I\\r\\nsoon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was one wing,\\r\\nhowever, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door which faced that\\r\\nwhich led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was\\r\\ninvariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr.\\r\\nRucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his\\r\\nface which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I\\r\\nwas accustomed. His cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and\\r\\nthe veins stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried\\r\\npast me without a word or a look.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds\\r\\nwith my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows\\r\\nof this part of the house. There were four of them in a row, three of which\\r\\nwere simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all\\r\\ndeserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr.\\r\\nRucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Ah!’ said he, ‘you must not think me rude if I\\r\\npassed you without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business\\r\\nmatters.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I assured him that I was not offended. ‘By the way,’ said I,\\r\\n‘you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them\\r\\nhas the shutters up.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my\\r\\nremark.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Photography is one of my hobbies,’ said he. ‘I\\r\\nhave made my dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we\\r\\nhave come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed\\r\\nit?’ He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he\\r\\nlooked at me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was\\r\\nsomething about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on fire\\r\\nto go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of that. It\\r\\nwas more a feeling of duty—a feeling that some good might come from my\\r\\npenetrating to this place. They talk of woman’s instinct; perhaps it was\\r\\nwoman’s instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there,\\r\\nand I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that, besides\\r\\nMr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted\\r\\nrooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the\\r\\ndoor. Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very\\r\\ndrunk; and when I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt\\r\\nat all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs,\\r\\nand the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned\\r\\nthe key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted,\\r\\nwhich turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner were three\\r\\ndoors in a line, the first and third of which were open. They each led into an\\r\\nempty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the\\r\\nother, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them.\\r\\nThe centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been fastened one\\r\\nof the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall,\\r\\nand fastened at the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well,\\r\\nand the key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the\\r\\nshuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it\\r\\nthat the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a skylight which let in\\r\\nlight from above. As I stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and\\r\\nwondering what secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within\\r\\nthe room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of\\r\\ndim light which shone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose\\r\\nup in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and\\r\\nI turned and ran—ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me\\r\\nclutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the\\r\\ndoor, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘So,’ said he, smiling, ‘it was you, then. I\\r\\nthought that it must be when I saw the door open.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Oh, I am so frightened!’ I panted.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘My dear young lady! my dear young lady!’—you\\r\\ncannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was—‘and what\\r\\nhas frightened you, my dear young lady?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was keenly\\r\\non my guard against him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,’ I\\r\\nanswered. ‘But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was\\r\\nfrightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Only that?’ said he, looking at me keenly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Why, what did you think?’ I asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Why do you think that I lock this door?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I am sure that I do not know.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you\\r\\nsee?’ He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I am sure if I had known—’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot\\r\\nover that threshold again’—here in an instant the smile hardened\\r\\ninto a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a\\r\\ndemon—‘I’ll throw you to the mastiff.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I must\\r\\nhave rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I found myself\\r\\nlying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could\\r\\nnot live there longer without some advice. I was frightened of the house, of\\r\\nthe man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all\\r\\nhorrible to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of course I\\r\\nmight have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as my\\r\\nfears. My mind was soon made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and\\r\\ncloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and\\r\\nthen returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind as\\r\\nI approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered that Toller\\r\\nhad drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening, and I knew that\\r\\nhe was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage\\r\\ncreature, or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and lay\\r\\nawake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you. I had no\\r\\ndifficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning, but I must be\\r\\nback before three o’clock, for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a\\r\\nvisit, and will be away all the evening, so that I must look after the child.\\r\\nNow I have told you all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if\\r\\nyou could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHolmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My friend\\r\\nrose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an\\r\\nexpression of the most profound gravity upon his face.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Is Toller still drunk?” he asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing with\\r\\nhim.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, the wine-cellar.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave\\r\\nand sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one more\\r\\nfeat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite exceptional\\r\\nwoman.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will try. What is it?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o’clock, my friend and\\r\\nI. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be\\r\\nincapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If you\\r\\ncould send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon her,\\r\\nyou would facilitate matters immensely.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will do it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course\\r\\nthere is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to\\r\\npersonate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber. That is\\r\\nobvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter,\\r\\nMiss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to America.\\r\\nYou were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the colour\\r\\nof your hair. Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some illness through\\r\\nwhich she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a\\r\\ncurious chance you came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly\\r\\nsome friend of hers—possibly her fiancÃ©—and no doubt, as you\\r\\nwore the girl’s dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your\\r\\nlaughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss\\r\\nRucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions.\\r\\nThe dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate\\r\\nwith her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case is the\\r\\ndisposition of the child.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What on earth has that to do with it?” I ejaculated.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to\\r\\nthe tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don’t you see that\\r\\nthe converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first real insight\\r\\ninto the character of parents by studying their children. This child’s\\r\\ndisposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty’s sake, and whether\\r\\nhe derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his\\r\\nmother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,” cried our client.\\r\\n“A thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have\\r\\nhit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor\\r\\ncreature.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We\\r\\ncan do nothing until seven o’clock. At that hour we shall be with you,\\r\\nand it will not be long before we solve the mystery.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the Copper\\r\\nBeeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The group of trees,\\r\\nwith their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting\\r\\nsun, were sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been standing\\r\\nsmiling on the door-step.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Have you managed it?” asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. “That is Mrs.\\r\\nToller in the cellar,” said she. “Her husband lies snoring on the\\r\\nkitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr.\\r\\nRucastle’s.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You have done well indeed!” cried Holmes with enthusiasm.\\r\\n“Now lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black\\r\\nbusiness.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and\\r\\nfound ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described.\\r\\nHolmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he tried the various\\r\\nkeys in the lock, but without success. No sound came from within, and at the\\r\\nsilence Holmes’ face clouded over.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I trust that we are not too late,” said he. “I think, Miss\\r\\nHunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to\\r\\nit, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength.\\r\\nTogether we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture save a\\r\\nlittle pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The skylight above\\r\\nwas open, and the prisoner gone.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There has been some villainy here,” said Holmes; “this\\r\\nbeauty has guessed Miss Hunter’s intentions and has carried his victim\\r\\noff.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But how?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.” He\\r\\nswung himself up onto the roof. “Ah, yes,” he cried,\\r\\n“here’s the end of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is\\r\\nhow he did it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But it is impossible,” said Miss Hunter; “the ladder was not\\r\\nthere when the Rucastles went away.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and\\r\\ndangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I\\r\\nhear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be as well for you to\\r\\nhave your pistol ready.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the\\r\\nroom, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand. Miss Hunter\\r\\nscreamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes\\r\\nsprang forward and confronted him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You villain!” said he, “where’s your daughter?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is for me to ask you that,” he shrieked, “you thieves!\\r\\nSpies and thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I’ll\\r\\nserve you!” He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could\\r\\ngo.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He’s gone for the dog!” cried Miss Hunter.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have my revolver,” said I.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Better close the front door,” cried Holmes, and we all rushed down\\r\\nthe stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of\\r\\na hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying sound which it\\r\\nwas dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs\\r\\ncame staggering out at a side door.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My God!” he cried. “Someone has loosed the dog. It’s\\r\\nnot been fed for two days. Quick, quick, or it’ll be too late!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHolmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller hurrying\\r\\nbehind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle buried in\\r\\nRucastle’s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the ground. Running\\r\\nup, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth still\\r\\nmeeting in the great creases of his neck. With much labour we separated them\\r\\nand carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. We laid him upon\\r\\nthe drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the\\r\\nnews to his wife, I did what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled\\r\\nround him when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Mrs. Toller!” cried Miss Hunter.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up\\r\\nto you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn’t let me know what you were\\r\\nplanning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ha!” said Holmes, looking keenly at her. “It is clear that\\r\\nMrs. Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points on\\r\\nwhich I must confess that I am still in the dark.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will soon make it clear to you,” said she; “and I’d\\r\\nhave done so before now if I could ha’ got out from the cellar. If\\r\\nthere’s police-court business over this, you’ll remember that I was\\r\\nthe one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice’s friend too.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn’t, from the time that\\r\\nher father married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything, but\\r\\nit never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler at a\\r\\nfriend’s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her\\r\\nown by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a\\r\\nword about them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle’s hands. He knew\\r\\nhe was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward,\\r\\nwho would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought it\\r\\ntime to put a stop on it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she\\r\\nmarried or not, he could use her money. When she wouldn’t do it, he kept\\r\\non worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at\\r\\ndeath’s door. Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with\\r\\nher beautiful hair cut off; but that didn’t make no change in her young\\r\\nman, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah,” said Holmes, “I think that what you have been good\\r\\nenough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that\\r\\nremains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of\\r\\nimprisonment?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the\\r\\ndisagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That was it, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be,\\r\\nblockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments,\\r\\nmetallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same as\\r\\nhis.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,” said\\r\\nMrs. Toller serenely.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of\\r\\ndrink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had\\r\\ngone out.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You have it, sir, just as it happened.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,” said Holmes,\\r\\n“for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here\\r\\ncomes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had\\r\\nbest escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our locus\\r\\nstandi now is rather a questionable one.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches\\r\\nin front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept\\r\\nalive solely through the care of his devoted wife. They still live with their\\r\\nold servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle’s past life that he\\r\\nfinds it difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were\\r\\nmarried, by special license, in Southampton the day after their flight, and he\\r\\nis now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to\\r\\nMiss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested\\r\\nno further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of\\r\\nhis problems, and she is now the head of a private school at Walsall, where I\\r\\nbelieve that she has met with considerable success.\\r\\n', '\\nWe were seated at\\r\\nbreakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a telegram. It\\r\\nwas from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the\\r\\nwest of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad if\\r\\nyou will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the\\r\\n11:15.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What do you say, dear?” said my wife, looking across at me.\\r\\n“Will you go?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I really don’t know what to say. I have a fairly long list at\\r\\npresent.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a\\r\\nlittle pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you are\\r\\nalways so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes’ cases.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one\\r\\nof them,” I answered. “But if I am to go, I must pack at once, for\\r\\nI have only half an hour.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of making\\r\\nme a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and simple, so that in less\\r\\nthan the time stated I was in a cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington\\r\\nStation. Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt\\r\\nfigure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and\\r\\nclose-fitting cloth cap.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is really very good of you to come, Watson,” said he. “It\\r\\nmakes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can\\r\\nthoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed. If you\\r\\nwill keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which\\r\\nHolmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read, with intervals\\r\\nof note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading. Then he suddenly\\r\\nrolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Have you heard anything of the case?” he asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been\\r\\nlooking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars. It\\r\\nseems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so\\r\\nextremely difficult.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That sounds a little paradoxical.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue. The\\r\\nmore featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring\\r\\nit home. In this case, however, they have established a very serious case\\r\\nagainst the son of the murdered man.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is a murder, then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until\\r\\nI have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will explain the state\\r\\nof things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few\\r\\nwords.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in\\r\\nHerefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner,\\r\\nwho made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country.\\r\\nOne of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles\\r\\nMcCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the\\r\\ncolonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they\\r\\nshould do so as near each other as possible. Turner was apparently the richer\\r\\nman, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of\\r\\nperfect equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad\\r\\nof eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of\\r\\nthem had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the\\r\\nneighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though both the\\r\\nMcCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of\\r\\nthe neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants—a man and a girl. Turner\\r\\nhad a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. That is as much as\\r\\nI have been able to gather about the families. Now for the facts.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at\\r\\nHatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool,\\r\\nwhich is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down\\r\\nthe Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his serving-man in the morning at\\r\\nRoss, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of\\r\\nimportance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came back alive.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“From Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile,\\r\\nand two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old woman,\\r\\nwhose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder, a game-keeper\\r\\nin the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was\\r\\nwalking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr.\\r\\nMcCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the same way with\\r\\na gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the father was actually in\\r\\nsight at the time, and the son was following him. He thought no more of the\\r\\nmatter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the\\r\\ngame-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round,\\r\\nwith just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl of fourteen,\\r\\nPatience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley\\r\\nestate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She states that while she was\\r\\nthere she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy\\r\\nand his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. She heard\\r\\nMr. McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the\\r\\nlatter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by\\r\\ntheir violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that\\r\\nshe had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was\\r\\nafraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said the words when young\\r\\nMr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father\\r\\ndead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much\\r\\nexcited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were\\r\\nobserved to be stained with fresh blood. On following him they found the dead\\r\\nbody stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in\\r\\nby repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as\\r\\nmight very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son’s gun,\\r\\nwhich was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these\\r\\ncircumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of\\r\\n‘wilful murder’ having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he\\r\\nwas on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the\\r\\ncase to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out\\r\\nbefore the coroner and the police-court.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I could hardly imagine a more damning case,” I remarked. “If\\r\\never circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,” answered Holmes\\r\\nthoughtfully. “It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if\\r\\nyou shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an\\r\\nequally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It must be\\r\\nconfessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young\\r\\nman, and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several\\r\\npeople in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the daughter\\r\\nof the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who have\\r\\nretained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection with the Study in\\r\\nScarlet, to work out the case in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled,\\r\\nhas referred the case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are\\r\\nflying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their\\r\\nbreakfasts at home.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am afraid,” said I, “that the facts are so obvious that\\r\\nyou will find little credit to be gained out of this case.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,” he\\r\\nanswered, laughing. “Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other\\r\\nobvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know\\r\\nme too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm\\r\\nor destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or\\r\\neven of understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly\\r\\nperceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and yet I\\r\\nquestion whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as\\r\\nthat.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How on earth—”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which\\r\\ncharacterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you shave by the\\r\\nsunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther\\r\\nback on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the\\r\\nangle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated\\r\\nthan the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in\\r\\nan equal light and being satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a\\r\\ntrivial example of observation and inference. Therein lies my mÃ©tier,\\r\\nand it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation\\r\\nwhich lies before us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out\\r\\nin the inquest, and which are worth considering.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What are they?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the\\r\\nreturn to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing him that\\r\\nhe was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that\\r\\nit was no more than his deserts. This observation of his had the natural effect\\r\\nof removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the\\r\\ncoroner’s jury.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was a confession,” I ejaculated.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a\\r\\nmost suspicious remark.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On the contrary,” said Holmes, “it is the brightest rift\\r\\nwhich I can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he\\r\\ncould not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances\\r\\nwere very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or\\r\\nfeigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious,\\r\\nbecause such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances,\\r\\nand yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His frank\\r\\nacceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a\\r\\nman of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark about his\\r\\ndeserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the\\r\\ndead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day\\r\\nso far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even,\\r\\naccording to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand\\r\\nas if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in\\r\\nhis remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a\\r\\nguilty one.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI shook my head. “Many men have been hanged on far slighter\\r\\nevidence,” I remarked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What is the young man’s own account of the matter?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there\\r\\nare one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find it here, and\\r\\nmay read it for yourself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, and\\r\\nhaving turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the\\r\\nunfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred. I\\r\\nsettled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully.\\r\\nIt ran in this way:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and\\r\\ngave evidence as follows: ‘I had been away from home for three days at\\r\\nBristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd.\\r\\nMy father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was informed by\\r\\nthe maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly\\r\\nafter my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of\\r\\nmy window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was not\\r\\naware in which direction he was going. I then took my gun and strolled out in\\r\\nthe direction of the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit\\r\\nwarren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the\\r\\ngame-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinking\\r\\nthat I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in front of me. When\\r\\nabout a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of “Cooee!” which\\r\\nwas a usual signal between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and\\r\\nfound him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me\\r\\nand asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A conversation ensued which\\r\\nled to high words and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very\\r\\nviolent temper. Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him\\r\\nand returned towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards,\\r\\nhowever, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back\\r\\nagain. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly\\r\\ninjured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost instantly\\r\\nexpired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to Mr.\\r\\nTurner’s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for\\r\\nassistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how\\r\\nhe came by his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and\\r\\nforbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no active enemies. I\\r\\nknow nothing further of the matter.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to\\r\\na rat.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The Coroner: What did you understand by that?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was delirious.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had this\\r\\nfinal quarrel?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Witness: I should prefer not to answer.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you\\r\\nthat it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to\\r\\nyou that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any\\r\\nfuture proceedings which may arise.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Witness: I must still refuse.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The Coroner: I understand that the cry of ‘Cooee’ was a\\r\\ncommon signal between you and your father?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Witness: It was.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and\\r\\nbefore he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you\\r\\nreturned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Witness: Nothing definite.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The Coroner: What do you mean?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open,\\r\\nthat I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague\\r\\nimpression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of\\r\\nme. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a\\r\\nplaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was\\r\\ngone.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for\\r\\nhelp?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Yes, it was gone.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“  ‘You cannot say what it was?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘No, I had a feeling something was there.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘How far from the body?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘A dozen yards or so.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘And how far from the edge of the wood?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘About the same.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen\\r\\nyards of it?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Yes, but with my back towards it.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This concluded the examination of the witness.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I see,” said I as I glanced down the column, “that the\\r\\ncoroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He\\r\\ncalls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having\\r\\nsignalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his\\r\\nconversation with his father, and his singular account of his father’s\\r\\ndying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHolmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned\\r\\nseat. “Both you and the coroner have been at some pains,” said he,\\r\\n“to single out the very strongest points in the young man’s favour.\\r\\nDon’t you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much\\r\\nimagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause of\\r\\nquarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved\\r\\nfrom his own inner consciousness anything so outrÃ© as a dying reference\\r\\nto a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach\\r\\nthis case from the point of view that what this young man says is true, and we\\r\\nshall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket\\r\\nPetrarch, and not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the\\r\\nscene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in\\r\\ntwenty minutes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was nearly four o’clock when we at last, after passing through the\\r\\nbeautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at\\r\\nthe pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-like man, furtive and\\r\\nsly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown\\r\\ndustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic\\r\\nsurroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard.\\r\\nWith him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged\\r\\nfor us.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have ordered a carriage,” said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of\\r\\ntea. “I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until\\r\\nyou had been on the scene of the crime.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was very nice and complimentary of you,” Holmes answered.\\r\\n“It is entirely a question of barometric pressure.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLestrade looked startled. “I do not quite follow,” he said.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the\\r\\nsky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is\\r\\nvery much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do not think that\\r\\nit is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLestrade laughed indulgently. “You have, no doubt, already formed your\\r\\nconclusions from the newspapers,” he said. “The case is as plain as\\r\\na pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still, of\\r\\ncourse, one can’t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. She\\r\\nhas heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her\\r\\nthat there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done. Why,\\r\\nbless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely\\r\\nyoung women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes shining, her lips\\r\\nparted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost\\r\\nin her overpowering excitement and concern.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!” she cried, glancing from one to the\\r\\nother of us, and finally, with a woman’s quick intuition, fastening upon\\r\\nmy companion, “I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to\\r\\ntell you so. I know that James didn’t do it. I know it, and I want you to\\r\\nstart upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point.\\r\\nWe have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults\\r\\nas no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge\\r\\nis absurd to anyone who really knows him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,” said Sherlock Holmes.\\r\\n“You may rely upon my doing all that I can.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do you\\r\\nnot see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is\\r\\ninnocent?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I think that it is very probable.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There, now!” she cried, throwing back her head and looking\\r\\ndefiantly at Lestrade. “You hear! He gives me hopes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. “I am afraid that my colleague has been\\r\\na little quick in forming his conclusions,” he said.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And\\r\\nabout his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would not\\r\\nspeak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In what way?” asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many\\r\\ndisagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a\\r\\nmarriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as brother and\\r\\nsister; but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet,\\r\\nand—and—well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that\\r\\nyet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And your father?” asked Holmes. “Was he in favour of such a\\r\\nunion?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of\\r\\nit.” A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of\\r\\nhis keen, questioning glances at her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thank you for this information,” said he. “May I see your\\r\\nfather if I call to-morrow?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am afraid the doctor won’t allow it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The doctor?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years\\r\\nback, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed, and Dr.\\r\\nWillows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered. Mr.\\r\\nMcCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in\\r\\nVictoria.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ha! In Victoria! That is important.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, at the mines.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made his\\r\\nmoney.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, certainly.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to\\r\\nme.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go to\\r\\nthe prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know him\\r\\nto be innocent.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will, Miss Turner.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave\\r\\nhim. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.” She hurried from\\r\\nthe room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her\\r\\ncarriage rattle off down the street.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am ashamed of you, Holmes,” said Lestrade with dignity after a\\r\\nfew minutes’ silence. “Why should you raise up hopes which you are\\r\\nbound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,” said\\r\\nHolmes. “Have you an order to see him in prison?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, but only for you and me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still\\r\\ntime to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ample.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I\\r\\nshall only be away a couple of hours.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets\\r\\nof the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa\\r\\nand tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the\\r\\nstory was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we\\r\\nwere groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the action to\\r\\nthe fact, that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely\\r\\nto a consideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young\\r\\nman’s story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what\\r\\nabsolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between\\r\\nthe time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his\\r\\nscreams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and deadly. What\\r\\ncould it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my\\r\\nmedical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper,\\r\\nwhich contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon’s\\r\\ndeposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and\\r\\nthe left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a\\r\\nblunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have\\r\\nbeen struck from behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as\\r\\nwhen seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go\\r\\nfor very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow\\r\\nfell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes’ attention to it.\\r\\nThen there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It\\r\\ncould not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become\\r\\ndelirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his\\r\\nfate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible\\r\\nexplanation. And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If\\r\\nthat were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress,\\r\\npresumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to\\r\\nreturn and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his\\r\\nback turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and\\r\\nimprobabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade’s\\r\\nopinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes’ insight that I\\r\\ncould not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his\\r\\nconviction of young McCarthy’s innocence.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for Lestrade\\r\\nwas staying in lodgings in the town.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The glass still keeps very high,” he remarked as he sat down.\\r\\n“It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go\\r\\nover the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and\\r\\nkeenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by\\r\\na long journey. I have seen young McCarthy.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And what did you learn from him?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nothing.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Could he throw no light?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had\\r\\ndone it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as\\r\\npuzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to\\r\\nlook at and, I should think, sound at heart.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I cannot admire his taste,” I remarked, “if it is indeed a\\r\\nfact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this\\r\\nMiss Turner.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly, insanely,\\r\\nin love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before he\\r\\nreally knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school, what\\r\\ndoes the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry\\r\\nher at a registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can\\r\\nimagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he\\r\\nwould give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible.\\r\\nIt was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air\\r\\nwhen his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss\\r\\nTurner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and his\\r\\nfather, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him over\\r\\nutterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent\\r\\nthe last three days in Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark\\r\\nthat point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however, for the\\r\\nbarmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be\\r\\nhanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has\\r\\na husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie\\r\\nbetween them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all\\r\\nthat he has suffered.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But if he is innocent, who has done it?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points.\\r\\nOne is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and\\r\\nthat the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did\\r\\nnot know when he would return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to\\r\\ncry ‘Cooee!’ before he knew that his son had returned. Those are\\r\\nthe crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk about\\r\\nGeorge Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters until\\r\\nto-morrow.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and\\r\\ncloudless. At nine o’clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and\\r\\nwe set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There is serious news this morning,” Lestrade observed. “It\\r\\nis said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired\\r\\nof.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“An elderly man, I presume?” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad,\\r\\nand he has been in failing health for some time. This business has had a very\\r\\nbad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy’s, and, I may add,\\r\\na great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm\\r\\nrent free.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Indeed! That is interesting,” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about here\\r\\nspeaks of his kindness to him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy,\\r\\nwho appears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such\\r\\nobligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son to Turner’s\\r\\ndaughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very\\r\\ncocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would\\r\\nfollow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself was averse to\\r\\nthe idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not deduce something from\\r\\nthat?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We have got to the deductions and the inferences,” said Lestrade,\\r\\nwinking at me. “I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without\\r\\nflying away after theories and fancies.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are right,” said Holmes demurely; “you do find it very\\r\\nhard to tackle the facts.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to\\r\\nget hold of,” replied Lestrade with some warmth.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And that is—”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all\\r\\ntheories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,” said Holmes,\\r\\nlaughing. “But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon\\r\\nthe left.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, that is it.” It was a widespread, comfortable-looking\\r\\nbuilding, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon\\r\\nthe grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a\\r\\nstricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We\\r\\ncalled at the door, when the maid, at Holmes’ request, showed us the\\r\\nboots which her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the\\r\\nson’s, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured these\\r\\nvery carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to be led\\r\\nto the court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which led to\\r\\nBoscombe Pool.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this. Men\\r\\nwho had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker Street would have\\r\\nfailed to recognise him. His face flushed and darkened. His brows were drawn\\r\\ninto two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a\\r\\nsteely glitter. His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips\\r\\ncompressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His\\r\\nnostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind\\r\\nwas so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or\\r\\nremark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick,\\r\\nimpatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track\\r\\nwhich ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool.\\r\\nIt was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of\\r\\nmany feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on\\r\\neither side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he\\r\\nmade quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him,\\r\\nthe detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the\\r\\ninterest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was\\r\\ndirected towards a definite end.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards\\r\\nacross, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private\\r\\npark of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods which lined it upon the farther\\r\\nside we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich\\r\\nlandowner’s dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew\\r\\nvery thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across\\r\\nbetween the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade\\r\\nshowed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so\\r\\nmoist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left\\r\\nby the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face\\r\\nand peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled\\r\\ngrass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon\\r\\nmy companion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What did you go into the pool for?” he asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or\\r\\nother trace. But how on earth—”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward\\r\\ntwist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among\\r\\nthe reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they\\r\\ncame like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party\\r\\nwith the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight\\r\\nfeet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same\\r\\nfeet.” He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a\\r\\nbetter view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. “These\\r\\nare young McCarthy’s feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly,\\r\\nso that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears\\r\\nout his story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the\\r\\nfather’s feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the\\r\\nbutt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we\\r\\nhere? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go,\\r\\nthey come again—of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they come\\r\\nfrom?” He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track\\r\\nuntil we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great\\r\\nbeech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way to the\\r\\nfarther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of\\r\\nsatisfaction. For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and\\r\\ndried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and\\r\\nexamining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as\\r\\nfar as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also\\r\\nhe carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the wood\\r\\nuntil he came to the high road, where all traces were lost.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It has been a case of considerable interest,” he remarked,\\r\\nreturning to his natural manner. “I fancy that this grey house on the\\r\\nright must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran,\\r\\nand perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our\\r\\nluncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into Ross,\\r\\nHolmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This may interest you, Lestrade,” he remarked, holding it out.\\r\\n“The murder was done with it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I see no marks.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There are none.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How do you know, then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days. There\\r\\nwas no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds with the\\r\\ninjuries. There is no sign of any other weapon.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And the murderer?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled\\r\\nshooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and\\r\\ncarries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are several other indications,\\r\\nbut these may be enough to aid us in our search.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLestrade laughed. “I am afraid that I am still a sceptic,” he said.\\r\\n“Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed\\r\\nBritish jury.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nous verrons,” answered Holmes calmly. “You work your\\r\\nown method, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall\\r\\nprobably return to London by the evening train.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And leave your case unfinished?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, finished.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But the mystery?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is solved.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Who was the criminal, then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The gentleman I describe.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But who is he?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a\\r\\npopulous neighbourhood.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. “I am a practical man,” he said,\\r\\n“and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a\\r\\nleft-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the laughing-stock of\\r\\nScotland Yard.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“All right,” said Holmes quietly. “I have given you the\\r\\nchance. Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I\\r\\nleave.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHaving left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we found lunch\\r\\nupon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained\\r\\nexpression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Look here, Watson,” he said when the cloth was cleared “just\\r\\nsit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don’t\\r\\nknow quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar and let me\\r\\nexpound.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n “Pray do so.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young\\r\\nMcCarthy’s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they\\r\\nimpressed me in his favour and you against him. One was the fact that his\\r\\nfather should, according to his account, cry ‘Cooee!’ before seeing\\r\\nhim. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled several\\r\\nwords, you understand, but that was all that caught the son’s ear. Now\\r\\nfrom this double point our research must commence, and we will begin it by\\r\\npresuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What of this ‘Cooee!’ then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as\\r\\nfar as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within earshot.\\r\\nThe ‘Cooee!’ was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was\\r\\nthat he had the appointment with. But ‘Cooee’ is a distinctly\\r\\nAustralian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a strong\\r\\npresumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool\\r\\nwas someone who had been in Australia.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What of the rat, then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the\\r\\ntable. “This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,” he said. “I\\r\\nwired to Bristol for it last night.” He put his hand over part of the\\r\\nmap. “What do you read?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“ARAT,” I read.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And now?” He raised his hand.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“BALLARAT.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only\\r\\ncaught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his murderer.\\r\\nSo and so, of Ballarat.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is wonderful!” I exclaimed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down\\r\\nconsiderably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point which,\\r\\ngranting the son’s statement to be correct, was a certainty. We have come\\r\\nnow out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Australian from\\r\\nBallarat with a grey cloak.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Certainly.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be\\r\\napproached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly\\r\\nwander.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Quite so.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I\\r\\ngained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as to the\\r\\npersonality of the criminal.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But how did you gain them?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of\\r\\ntrifles.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his\\r\\nstride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, they were peculiar boots.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But his lameness?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left.\\r\\nHe put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped—he was lame.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But his left-handedness.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the\\r\\nsurgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately behind, and yet\\r\\nwas upon the left side. Now, how can that be unless it were by a left-handed\\r\\nman? He had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and\\r\\nson. He had even smoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special\\r\\nknowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have,\\r\\nas you know, devoted some attention to this, and written a little monograph on\\r\\nthe ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco.\\r\\nHaving found the ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the\\r\\nmoss where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which are\\r\\nrolled in Rotterdam.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And the cigar-holder?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used a\\r\\nholder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not a clean\\r\\none, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Holmes,” I said, “you have drawn a net round this man from\\r\\nwhich he cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as\\r\\nif you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction in which all\\r\\nthis points. The culprit is—”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Mr. John Turner,” cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our\\r\\nsitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow, limping step\\r\\nand bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude, and yet his hard,\\r\\ndeep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed that he was\\r\\npossessed of unusual strength of body and of character. His tangled beard,\\r\\ngrizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of\\r\\ndignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while\\r\\nhis lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It\\r\\nwas clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic\\r\\ndisease.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Pray sit down on the sofa,” said Holmes gently. “You had my\\r\\nnote?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see me\\r\\nhere to avoid scandal.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And why did you wish to see me?” He looked across at my companion\\r\\nwith despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words.\\r\\n“It is so. I know all about McCarthy.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe old man sank his face in his hands. “God help me!” he cried.\\r\\n“But I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word\\r\\nthat I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am glad to hear you say so,” said Holmes gravely.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would break\\r\\nher heart—it will break her heart when she hears that I am\\r\\narrested.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It may not come to that,” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who\\r\\nrequired my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young McCarthy\\r\\nmust be got off, however.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am a dying man,” said old Turner. “I have had diabetes for\\r\\nyears. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I\\r\\nwould rather die under my own roof than in a gaol.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHolmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of\\r\\npaper before him. “Just tell us the truth,” he said. “I shall\\r\\njot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it. Then I\\r\\ncould produce your confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy. I\\r\\npromise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It’s as well,” said the old man; “it’s a\\r\\nquestion whether I shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I\\r\\nshould wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to\\r\\nyou; it has been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You didn’t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate.\\r\\nI tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he. His grip\\r\\nhas been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life. I’ll\\r\\ntell you first how I came to be in his power.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was in the early ’60’s at the diggings. I was a young\\r\\nchap then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got\\r\\namong bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to the\\r\\nbush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber.\\r\\nThere were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station\\r\\nfrom time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings. Black\\r\\nJack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party is still remembered\\r\\nin the colony as the Ballarat Gang.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay\\r\\nin wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us, so it\\r\\nwas a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley.\\r\\nThree of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol\\r\\nto the head of the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the\\r\\nLord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his wicked little\\r\\neyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature. We got away with\\r\\nthe gold, became wealthy men, and made our way over to England without being\\r\\nsuspected. There I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a\\r\\nquiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in the\\r\\nmarket, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to make up for the\\r\\nway in which I had earned it. I married, too, and though my wife died young she\\r\\nleft me my dear little Alice. Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed\\r\\nto lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I\\r\\nturned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was going\\r\\nwell when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent\\r\\nStreet with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Here we are, Jack,’ says he, touching me on the arm;\\r\\n‘we’ll be as good as a family to you. There’s two of us, me\\r\\nand my son, and you can have the keeping of us. If you\\r\\ndon’t—it’s a fine, law-abiding country is England, and\\r\\nthere’s always a policeman within hail.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them off,\\r\\nand there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since. There was no\\r\\nrest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his\\r\\ncunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon\\r\\nsaw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he\\r\\nwanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without question, land,\\r\\nmoney, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I could not give. He asked\\r\\nfor Alice.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known\\r\\nto be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step\\r\\ninto the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not have his cursed\\r\\nstock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was\\r\\nin him, and that was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to\\r\\ndo his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it\\r\\nover.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a\\r\\ncigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I listened to\\r\\nhis talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost. He was\\r\\nurging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might\\r\\nthink as if she were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that\\r\\nI and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this.\\r\\nCould I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though\\r\\nclear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed.\\r\\nBut my memory and my girl! Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul\\r\\ntongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned, I\\r\\nhave led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl should be\\r\\nentangled in the same meshes which held me was more than I could suffer. I\\r\\nstruck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and\\r\\nvenomous beast. His cry brought back his son; but I had gained the cover of the\\r\\nwood, though I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in\\r\\nmy flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that occurred.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, it is not for me to judge you,” said Holmes as the old man\\r\\nsigned the statement which had been drawn out. “I pray that we may never\\r\\nbe exposed to such a temptation.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will\\r\\nsoon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes. I will\\r\\nkeep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I shall be forced to use it.\\r\\nIf not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be\\r\\nalive or dead, shall be safe with us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Farewell, then,” said the old man solemnly. “Your own\\r\\ndeathbeds, when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace\\r\\nwhich you have given to mine.” Tottering and shaking in all his giant\\r\\nframe, he stumbled slowly from the room.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“God help us!” said Holmes after a long silence. “Why does\\r\\nfate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as\\r\\nthis that I do not think of Baxter’s words, and say, ‘There, but\\r\\nfor the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.’”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nJames McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number of\\r\\nobjections which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the defending\\r\\ncounsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our interview, but he is now\\r\\ndead; and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live\\r\\nhappily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past.\\r\\n'], 'metadata': {'author': ['Arthur Conan Doyle', 'Arthur Conan Doyle'], 'year': tensor([1891, 1891]), 'url': ['https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1661/1661-h/1661-h.htm', 'https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1661/1661-h/1661-h.htm'], 'name': ['copper_beeches', 'boscombe_valley']}}\n",
      "{'name': ['Sherlock Holmes - The Red-Headed League', 'Sherlock Holmes - A Case of Identity'], 'body': [' I had\\r\\ncalled upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year\\r\\nand found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly\\r\\ngentleman with fiery red hair. With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to\\r\\nwithdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door\\r\\nbehind me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear\\r\\nWatson,” he said cordially.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was afraid that you were engaged.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“So I am. Very much so.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I can wait in the next room.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper\\r\\nin many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the\\r\\nutmost use to me in yours also.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a\\r\\nquick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Try the settee,” said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and\\r\\nputting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods.\\r\\n“I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre\\r\\nand outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have\\r\\nshown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle,\\r\\nand, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own\\r\\nlittle adventures.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,” I\\r\\nobserved.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went\\r\\ninto the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for\\r\\nstrange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which\\r\\nis always far more daring than any effort of the imagination.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for\\r\\notherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks\\r\\ndown under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has\\r\\nbeen good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which\\r\\npromises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time.\\r\\nYou have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very\\r\\noften connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and\\r\\noccasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime\\r\\nhas been committed. As far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say\\r\\nwhether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of\\r\\nevents is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.\\r\\nPerhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your\\r\\nnarrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the\\r\\nopening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious\\r\\nto have every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some\\r\\nslight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the\\r\\nthousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. In the present\\r\\ninstance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief,\\r\\nunique.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride\\r\\nand pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his\\r\\ngreatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust\\r\\nforward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the\\r\\nman and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications\\r\\nwhich might be presented by his dress or appearance.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore every\\r\\nmark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and\\r\\nslow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd’s check trousers, a not\\r\\nover-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with\\r\\na heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as\\r\\nan ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet\\r\\ncollar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was\\r\\nnothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression\\r\\nof extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes’ quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head\\r\\nwith a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. “Beyond the obvious\\r\\nfacts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he\\r\\nis a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable\\r\\namount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper,\\r\\nbut his eyes upon my companion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr.\\r\\nHolmes?” he asked. “How did you know, for example, that I did\\r\\nmanual labour. It’s as true as gospel, for I began as a ship’s\\r\\ncarpenter.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than\\r\\nyour left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I won’t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,\\r\\nespecially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an\\r\\narc-and-compass breastpin.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five\\r\\ninches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it\\r\\nupon the desk?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, but China?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could\\r\\nonly have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and\\r\\nhave even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of staining\\r\\nthe fishes’ scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When,\\r\\nin addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter\\r\\nbecomes even more simple.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. “Well, I never!” said he.\\r\\n“I thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see that\\r\\nthere was nothing in it after all.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I begin to think, Watson,” said Holmes, “that I make a\\r\\nmistake in explaining. ‘Omne ignotum pro magnifico,’ you\\r\\nknow, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I\\r\\nam so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I have got it now,” he answered with his thick red finger\\r\\nplanted halfway down the column. “Here it is. This is what began it all.\\r\\nYou just read it for yourself, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI took the paper from him and read as follows:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah\\r\\nHopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., there is now another vacancy open\\r\\nwhich entitles a member of the League to a salary of Â£ 4 a week for purely\\r\\nnominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above\\r\\nthe age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at eleven\\r\\no’clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope’s\\r\\nCourt, Fleet Street.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What on earth does this mean?” I ejaculated after I had twice read\\r\\nover the extraordinary announcement.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHolmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high\\r\\nspirits. “It is a little off the beaten track, isn’t it?”\\r\\nsaid he. “And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all\\r\\nabout yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had\\r\\nupon your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the\\r\\ndate.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months\\r\\nago.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,”\\r\\nsaid Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; “I have a small\\r\\npawnbroker’s business at Coburg Square, near the City. It’s not a\\r\\nvery large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a\\r\\nliving. I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and\\r\\nI would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so\\r\\nas to learn the business.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What is the name of this obliging youth?” asked Sherlock Holmes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he’s not such a youth, either.\\r\\nIt’s hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr.\\r\\nHolmes; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I\\r\\nam able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas\\r\\nin his head?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employÃ© who\\r\\ncomes under the full market price. It is not a common experience among\\r\\nemployers in this age. I don’t know that your assistant is not as\\r\\nremarkable as your advertisement.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, he has his faults, too,” said Mr. Wilson. “Never was\\r\\nsuch a fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be\\r\\nimproving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its\\r\\nhole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on the whole\\r\\nhe’s a good worker. There’s no vice in him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He is still with you, I presume?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking\\r\\nand keeps the place clean—that’s all I have in the house, for I am\\r\\na widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three of us;\\r\\nand we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he\\r\\ncame down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in\\r\\nhis hand, and he says:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed\\r\\nman.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Why that?’ I asks.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Why,’ says he, ‘here’s another vacancy on\\r\\nthe League of the Red-headed Men. It’s worth quite a little fortune to\\r\\nany man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there\\r\\nare men, so that the trustees are at their wits’ end what to do with the\\r\\nmoney. If my hair would only change colour, here’s a nice little crib all\\r\\nready for me to step into.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Why, what is it, then?’ I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes,\\r\\nI am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my\\r\\nhaving to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the\\r\\ndoor-mat. In that way I didn’t know much of what was going on outside,\\r\\nand I was always glad of a bit of news.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed\\r\\nMen?’ he asked with his eyes open.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Never.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for\\r\\none of the vacancies.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘And what are they worth?’ I asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is\\r\\nslight, and it need not interfere very much with one’s other\\r\\noccupations.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the\\r\\nbusiness has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred\\r\\nwould have been very handy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Tell me all about it,’ said I.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Well,’ said he, showing me the advertisement,\\r\\n‘you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the\\r\\naddress where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the\\r\\nLeague was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very\\r\\npeculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy\\r\\nfor all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he had left his\\r\\nenormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the\\r\\ninterest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour.\\r\\nFrom all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘But,’ said I, ‘there would be millions of\\r\\nred-headed men who would apply.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Not so many as you might think,’ he answered.\\r\\n‘You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This\\r\\nAmerican had started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old\\r\\ntown a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your\\r\\nhair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery\\r\\nred. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but\\r\\nperhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for\\r\\nthe sake of a few hundred pounds.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my\\r\\nhair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was\\r\\nto be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I\\r\\nhad ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought\\r\\nhe might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day\\r\\nand to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we\\r\\nshut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the\\r\\nadvertisement.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north,\\r\\nsouth, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped\\r\\ninto the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street was choked with\\r\\nred-headed folk, and Pope’s Court looked like a coster’s orange\\r\\nbarrow. I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as\\r\\nwere brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they\\r\\nwere—straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as\\r\\nSpaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint.\\r\\nWhen I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but\\r\\nSpaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he\\r\\npushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to\\r\\nthe steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the stair,\\r\\nsome going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well\\r\\nas we could and soon found ourselves in the office.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your experience has been a most entertaining one,” remarked Holmes\\r\\nas his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.\\r\\n“Pray continue your very interesting statement.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal\\r\\ntable, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine.\\r\\nHe said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed\\r\\nto find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did\\r\\nnot seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came\\r\\nthe little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he\\r\\nclosed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,’ said my assistant,\\r\\n‘and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘And he is admirably suited for it,’ the other\\r\\nanswered. ‘He has every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen\\r\\nanything so fine.’ He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side,\\r\\nand gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged\\r\\nforward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘It would be injustice to hesitate,’ said he.\\r\\n‘You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious\\r\\nprecaution.’ With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged\\r\\nuntil I yelled with the pain. ‘There is water in your eyes,’ said\\r\\nhe as he released me. ‘I perceive that all is as it should be. But we\\r\\nhave to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint.\\r\\nI could tell you tales of cobbler’s wax which would disgust you with\\r\\nhuman nature.’ He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at\\r\\nthe top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment\\r\\ncame up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until\\r\\nthere was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘My name,’ said he, ‘is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I\\r\\nam myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are\\r\\nyou a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I answered that I had not.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“His face fell immediately.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Dear me!’ he said gravely, ‘that is very\\r\\nserious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for\\r\\nthe propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance.\\r\\nIt is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to\\r\\nhave the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he\\r\\nsaid that it would be all right.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘In the case of another,’ said he, ‘the\\r\\nobjection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with\\r\\nsuch a head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new\\r\\nduties?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business\\r\\nalready,’ said I.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!’ said Vincent\\r\\nSpaulding. ‘I should be able to look after that for you.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘What would be the hours?’ I asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Ten to two.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now a pawnbroker’s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr.\\r\\nHolmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day;\\r\\nso it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. Besides, I knew\\r\\nthat my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned\\r\\nup.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘That would suit me very well,’ said I. ‘And the\\r\\npay?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Is Â£ 4 a week.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘And the work?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Is purely nominal.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘What do you call purely nominal?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the\\r\\nbuilding, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position\\r\\nforever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don’t comply with\\r\\nthe conditions if you budge from the office during that time.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘It’s only four hours a day, and I should not think of\\r\\nleaving,’ said I.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘No excuse will avail,’ said Mr. Duncan Ross;\\r\\n‘neither sickness nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or\\r\\nyou lose your billet.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘And the work?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Is to copy out the EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica. There is the\\r\\nfirst volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and\\r\\nblotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready\\r\\nto-morrow?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Certainly,’ I answered.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate\\r\\nyou once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to\\r\\ngain.’ He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant,\\r\\nhardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low\\r\\nspirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be\\r\\nsome great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine.\\r\\nIt seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that\\r\\nthey would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the\\r\\nEncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica. Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me\\r\\nup, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in\\r\\nthe morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny\\r\\nbottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I\\r\\nstarted off for Pope’s Court.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible.\\r\\nThe table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I\\r\\ngot fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and then he left me;\\r\\nbut he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. At\\r\\ntwo o’clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I\\r\\nhad written, and locked the door of the office after me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager came\\r\\nin and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week’s work. It was the\\r\\nsame next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I was there at ten,\\r\\nand every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in\\r\\nonly once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all.\\r\\nStill, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not\\r\\nsure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so\\r\\nwell, that I would not risk the loss of it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and\\r\\nArchery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence that I\\r\\nmight get on to the B’s before very long. It cost me something in\\r\\nfoolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. And then\\r\\nsuddenly the whole business came to an end.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“To an end?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual at\\r\\nten o’clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of\\r\\ncardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here it is, and\\r\\nyou can read for yourself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper.\\r\\nIt read in this fashion:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED. October 9, 1890.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face\\r\\nbehind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every\\r\\nother consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I cannot see that there is anything very funny,” cried our client,\\r\\nflushing up to the roots of his flaming head. “If you can do nothing\\r\\nbetter than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, no,” cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which\\r\\nhe had half risen. “I really wouldn’t miss your case for the world.\\r\\nIt is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so,\\r\\nsomething just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you\\r\\nfound the card upon the door?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the\\r\\noffices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I\\r\\nwent to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground floor, and I\\r\\nasked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He said\\r\\nthat he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross\\r\\nwas. He answered that the name was new to him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Well,’ said I, ‘the gentleman at No. 4.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘What, the red-headed man?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Yes.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Oh,’ said he, ‘his name was William Morris. He\\r\\nwas a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new\\r\\npremises were ready. He moved out yesterday.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Where could I find him?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17\\r\\nKing Edward Street, near St. Paul’s.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a\\r\\nmanufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either\\r\\nMr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And what did you do then?” asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my\\r\\nassistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I\\r\\nwaited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I\\r\\ndid not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that\\r\\nyou were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came\\r\\nright away to you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And you did very wisely,” said Holmes. “Your case is an\\r\\nexceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you\\r\\nhave told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than\\r\\nmight at first sight appear.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Grave enough!” said Mr. Jabez Wilson. “Why, I have lost four\\r\\npound a week.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As far as you are personally concerned,” remarked Holmes, “I\\r\\ndo not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On\\r\\nthe contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some Â£ 30, to say nothing of\\r\\nthe minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under\\r\\nthe letter A. You have lost nothing by them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what\\r\\ntheir object was in playing this prank—if it was a prank—upon me.\\r\\nIt was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty\\r\\npounds.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one or\\r\\ntwo questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called your\\r\\nattention to the advertisement—how long had he been with you?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“About a month then.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How did he come?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In answer to an advertisement.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Was he the only applicant?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, I had a dozen.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why did you pick him?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Because he was handy and would come cheap.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“At half wages, in fact.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though\\r\\nhe’s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his\\r\\nforehead.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHolmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. “I thought as\\r\\nmuch,” said he. “Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced\\r\\nfor earrings?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a\\r\\nlad.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hum!” said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. “He is\\r\\nstill with you?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And has your business been attended to in your absence?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nothing to complain of, sir. There’s never very much to do of a\\r\\nmorning.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon\\r\\nthe subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that\\r\\nby Monday we may come to a conclusion.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, Watson,” said Holmes when our visitor had left us,\\r\\n“what do you make of it all?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I make nothing of it,” I answered frankly. “It is a most\\r\\nmysterious business.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As a rule,” said Holmes, “the more bizarre a thing is the\\r\\nless mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes\\r\\nwhich are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to\\r\\nidentify. But I must be prompt over this matter.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What are you going to do, then?” I asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“To smoke,” he answered. “It is quite a three pipe problem,\\r\\nand I beg that you won’t speak to me for fifty minutes.” He curled\\r\\nhimself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose,\\r\\nand there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out\\r\\nlike the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had\\r\\ndropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of\\r\\nhis chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe\\r\\ndown upon the mantelpiece.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Sarasate plays at the St. James’s Hall this afternoon,” he\\r\\nremarked. “What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a\\r\\nfew hours?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and we\\r\\ncan have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal of German\\r\\nmusic on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or\\r\\nFrench. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us\\r\\nto Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to\\r\\nin the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines\\r\\nof dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure,\\r\\nwhere a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard\\r\\nfight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a\\r\\nbrown board with “JABEZ WILSON” in white letters, upon a corner\\r\\nhouse, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business.\\r\\nSherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it\\r\\nall over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked\\r\\nslowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly\\r\\nat the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker’s, and, having\\r\\nthumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went\\r\\nup to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking,\\r\\nclean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thank you,” said Holmes, “I only wished to ask you how you\\r\\nwould go from here to the Strand.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Third right, fourth left,” answered the assistant promptly,\\r\\nclosing the door.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Smart fellow, that,” observed Holmes as we walked away. “He\\r\\nis, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not\\r\\nsure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him\\r\\nbefore.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Evidently,” said I, “Mr. Wilson’s assistant counts for\\r\\na good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you\\r\\ninquired your way merely in order that you might see him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The knees of his trousers.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And what did you see?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What I expected to see.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why did you beat the pavement?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are\\r\\nspies in an enemy’s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let\\r\\nus now explore the parts which lie behind it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the\\r\\nretired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of\\r\\na picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the\\r\\ntraffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the\\r\\nimmense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while\\r\\nthe footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was\\r\\ndifficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately\\r\\nbusiness premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and\\r\\nstagnant square which we had just quitted.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Let me see,” said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing\\r\\nalong the line, “I should like just to remember the order of the houses\\r\\nhere. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is\\r\\nMortimer’s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch\\r\\nof the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane’s\\r\\ncarriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now,\\r\\nDoctor, we’ve done our work, so it’s time we had some play. A\\r\\nsandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is\\r\\nsweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex\\r\\nus with their conundrums.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable\\r\\nperformer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he sat in the\\r\\nstalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin\\r\\nfingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid,\\r\\ndreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the\\r\\nrelentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to\\r\\nconceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted\\r\\nitself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often\\r\\nthought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which\\r\\noccasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme\\r\\nlanguor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly\\r\\nformidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid\\r\\nhis improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of\\r\\nthe chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power\\r\\nwould rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with\\r\\nhis methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that\\r\\nof other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at\\r\\nSt. James’s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom\\r\\nhe had set himself to hunt down.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,” he remarked as we emerged.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, it would be as well.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This business\\r\\nat Coburg Square is serious.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why serious?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe\\r\\nthat we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather\\r\\ncomplicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“At what time?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ten will be early enough.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I shall be at Baker Street at ten.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so\\r\\nkindly put your army revolver in your pocket.” He waved his hand, turned\\r\\non his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed\\r\\nwith a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I\\r\\nhad heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his\\r\\nwords it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what\\r\\nwas about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and\\r\\ngrotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all,\\r\\nfrom the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the\\r\\nEncyclopÃ¦dia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous\\r\\nwords with which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and\\r\\nwhy should I go armed? Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the\\r\\nhint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker’s assistant was a\\r\\nformidable man—a man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it\\r\\nout, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should\\r\\nbring an explanation.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way across the\\r\\nPark, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms were standing\\r\\nat the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from\\r\\nabove. On entering his room, I found Holmes in animated conversation with two\\r\\nmen, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while\\r\\nthe other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and\\r\\noppressively respectable frock-coat.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ha! Our party is complete,” said Holmes, buttoning up his\\r\\npea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. “Watson, I\\r\\nthink you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr.\\r\\nMerryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night’s adventure.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We’re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,” said Jones\\r\\nin his consequential way. “Our friend here is a wonderful man for\\r\\nstarting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running\\r\\ndown.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,”\\r\\nobserved Mr. Merryweather gloomily.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,” said\\r\\nthe police agent loftily. “He has his own little methods, which are, if\\r\\nhe won’t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic,\\r\\nbut he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say that\\r\\nonce or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure,\\r\\nhe has been more nearly correct than the official force.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,” said the stranger\\r\\nwith deference. “Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first\\r\\nSaturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I think you will find,” said Sherlock Holmes, “that you will\\r\\nplay for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play\\r\\nwill be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be some Â£\\r\\n30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your\\r\\nhands.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He’s a young\\r\\nman, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would\\r\\nrather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He’s a\\r\\nremarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he\\r\\nhimself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers,\\r\\nand though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the\\r\\nman himself. He’ll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising\\r\\nmoney to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I’ve been on his track\\r\\nfor years and have never set eyes on him yet.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night.\\r\\nI’ve had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree\\r\\nwith you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however, and\\r\\nquite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I\\r\\nwill follow in the second.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back\\r\\nin the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. We rattled\\r\\nthrough an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into\\r\\nFarrington Street.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We are close there now,” my friend remarked. “This fellow\\r\\nMerryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I\\r\\nthought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though\\r\\nan absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as\\r\\nbrave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon\\r\\nanyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in\\r\\nthe morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr.\\r\\nMerryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he\\r\\nopened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive\\r\\niron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps,\\r\\nwhich terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light\\r\\na lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so,\\r\\nafter opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all\\r\\nround with crates and massive boxes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are not very vulnerable from above,” Holmes remarked as he\\r\\nheld up the lantern and gazed about him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nor from below,” said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon\\r\\nthe flags which lined the floor. “Why, dear me, it sounds quite\\r\\nhollow!” he remarked, looking up in surprise.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!” said Holmes\\r\\nseverely. “You have already imperilled the whole success of our\\r\\nexpedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one\\r\\nof those boxes, and not to interfere?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured\\r\\nexpression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and,\\r\\nwith the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks\\r\\nbetween the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his\\r\\nfeet again and put his glass in his pocket.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We have at least an hour before us,” he remarked, “for they\\r\\ncan hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they\\r\\nwill not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they\\r\\nwill have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor—as no doubt you\\r\\nhave divined—in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal\\r\\nLondon banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will\\r\\nexplain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London\\r\\nshould take a considerable interest in this cellar at present.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is our French gold,” whispered the director. “We have had\\r\\nseveral warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your French gold?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and\\r\\nborrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has\\r\\nbecome known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it\\r\\nis still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000\\r\\nnapoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much\\r\\nlarger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the\\r\\ndirectors have had misgivings upon the subject.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Which were very well justified,” observed Holmes. “And now\\r\\nit is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour\\r\\nmatters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the\\r\\nscreen over that dark lantern.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And sit in the dark?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I\\r\\nthought that, as we were a partie carrÃ©e, you might have your rubber\\r\\nafter all. But I see that the enemy’s preparations have gone so far that\\r\\nwe cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our\\r\\npositions. These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a\\r\\ndisadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand\\r\\nbehind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I\\r\\nflash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no\\r\\ncompunction about shooting them down.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I\\r\\ncrouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in\\r\\npitch darkness—such an absolute darkness as I have never before\\r\\nexperienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was\\r\\nstill there, ready to flash out at a moment’s notice. To me, with my\\r\\nnerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and\\r\\nsubduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They have but one retreat,” whispered Holmes. “That is back\\r\\nthrough the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I\\r\\nasked you, Jones?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and\\r\\nwait.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhat a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a\\r\\nquarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone, and the\\r\\ndawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to\\r\\nchange my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of\\r\\ntension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle\\r\\nbreathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier\\r\\nin-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director.\\r\\nFrom my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor.\\r\\nSuddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened\\r\\nout until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a\\r\\ngash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which\\r\\nfelt about in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the\\r\\nhand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was\\r\\nwithdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single\\r\\nlurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIts disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing sound,\\r\\none of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square,\\r\\ngaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there\\r\\npeeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a\\r\\nhand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high,\\r\\nuntil one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of\\r\\nthe hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself,\\r\\nwith a pale face and a shock of very red hair.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It’s all clear,” he whispered. “Have you the chisel\\r\\nand the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I’ll swing for\\r\\nit!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. The other\\r\\ndived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched\\r\\nat his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but\\r\\nHolmes’ hunting crop came down on the man’s wrist, and the pistol\\r\\nclinked upon the stone floor.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It’s no use, John Clay,” said Holmes blandly. “You\\r\\nhave no chance at all.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“So I see,” the other answered with the utmost coolness. “I\\r\\nfancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his\\r\\ncoat-tails.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There are three men waiting for him at the door,” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must\\r\\ncompliment you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I you,” Holmes answered. “Your red-headed idea was very\\r\\nnew and effective.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You’ll see your pal again presently,” said Jones.\\r\\n“He’s quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while\\r\\nI fix the derbies.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,” remarked\\r\\nour prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. “You may not be\\r\\naware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also, when you\\r\\naddress me always to say ‘sir’ and\\r\\n‘please.’”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“All right,” said Jones with a stare and a snigger. “Well,\\r\\nwould you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your\\r\\nHighness to the police-station?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is better,” said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow\\r\\nto the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Really, Mr. Holmes,” said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them\\r\\nfrom the cellar, “I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you.\\r\\nThere is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete\\r\\nmanner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come\\r\\nwithin my experience.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John\\r\\nClay,” said Holmes. “I have been at some small expense over this\\r\\nmatter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply\\r\\nrepaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing\\r\\nthe very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You see, Watson,” he explained in the early hours of the morning\\r\\nas we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, “it was\\r\\nperfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather\\r\\nfantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the\\r\\nEncyclopÃ¦dia, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the\\r\\nway for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but,\\r\\nreally, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt\\r\\nsuggested to Clay’s ingenious mind by the colour of his\\r\\naccomplice’s hair. The Â£ 4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and\\r\\nwhat was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the\\r\\nadvertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the\\r\\nman to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every\\r\\nmorning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come\\r\\nfor half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for\\r\\nsecuring the situation.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But how could you guess what the motive was?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar\\r\\nintrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man’s business was\\r\\na small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such\\r\\nelaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then,\\r\\nbe something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the\\r\\nassistant’s fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the\\r\\ncellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made\\r\\ninquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one\\r\\nof the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in\\r\\nthe cellar—something which took many hours a day for months on end. What\\r\\ncould it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a\\r\\ntunnel to some other building.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised\\r\\nyou by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the\\r\\ncellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the\\r\\nbell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes,\\r\\nbut we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face.\\r\\nHis knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn,\\r\\nwrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The\\r\\nonly remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round the\\r\\ncorner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend’s premises,\\r\\nand felt that I had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I\\r\\ncalled upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the\\r\\nresult that you have seen.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And how could you tell that they would make their attempt\\r\\nto-night?” I asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they\\r\\ncared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson’s presence—in other words,\\r\\nthat they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should use\\r\\nit soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturday\\r\\nwould suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for\\r\\ntheir escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You reasoned it out beautifully,” I exclaimed in unfeigned\\r\\nadmiration. “It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It saved me from ennui,” he answered, yawning. “Alas! I\\r\\nalready feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to\\r\\nescape from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do\\r\\nso.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And you are a benefactor of the race,” said I.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe shrugged his shoulders. “Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some\\r\\nlittle use,” he remarked. “‘L’homme\\r\\nc’est rien—l’Å\\x93uvre c’est tout,’ as Gustave\\r\\nFlaubert wrote to George Sand.”\\r\\n', '\\n“My dear\\r\\nfellow,” said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his\\r\\nlodgings at Baker Street, “life is infinitely stranger than anything\\r\\nwhich the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the things\\r\\nwhich are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that\\r\\nwindow hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and\\r\\npeep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the\\r\\nplannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through\\r\\ngenerations, and leading to the most outrÃ© results, it would make all\\r\\nfiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and\\r\\nunprofitable.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And yet I am not convinced of it,” I answered. “The cases\\r\\nwhich come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar\\r\\nenough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and\\r\\nyet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor\\r\\nartistic.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic\\r\\neffect,” remarked Holmes. “This is wanting in the police report,\\r\\nwhere more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than\\r\\nupon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole\\r\\nmatter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the\\r\\ncommonplace.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI smiled and shook my head. “I can quite understand your thinking\\r\\nso,” I said. “Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and\\r\\nhelper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you\\r\\nare brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But\\r\\nhere”—I picked up the morning paper from the\\r\\nground—“let us put it to a practical test. Here is the first\\r\\nheading upon which I come. ‘A husband’s cruelty to his wife.’\\r\\nThere is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all\\r\\nperfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the\\r\\npush, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of\\r\\nwriters could invent nothing more crude.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,”\\r\\nsaid Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. “This is the\\r\\nDundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some\\r\\nsmall points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no\\r\\nother woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the\\r\\nhabit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them\\r\\nat his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the\\r\\nimagination of the average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and\\r\\nacknowledge that I have scored over you in your example.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of\\r\\nthe lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life\\r\\nthat I could not help commenting upon it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah,” said he, “I forgot that I had not seen you for some\\r\\nweeks. It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my\\r\\nassistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And the ring?” I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which\\r\\nsparkled upon his finger.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which I\\r\\nserved them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who have\\r\\nbeen good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And have you any on hand just now?” I asked with interest.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest. They\\r\\nare important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed, I have found\\r\\nthat it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the\\r\\nobservation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the\\r\\ncharm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the\\r\\nbigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases,\\r\\nsave for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from\\r\\nMarseilles, there is nothing which presents any features of interest. It is\\r\\npossible, however, that I may have something better before very many minutes\\r\\nare over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing\\r\\ndown into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over his shoulder, I\\r\\nsaw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur\\r\\nboa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat\\r\\nwhich was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear.\\r\\nFrom under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at\\r\\nour windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers\\r\\nfidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who\\r\\nleaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of\\r\\nthe bell.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have seen those symptoms before,” said Holmes, throwing his\\r\\ncigarette into the fire. “Oscillation upon the pavement always means an\\r\\naffaire de cÅ\\x93ur. She would like advice, but is not sure that the matter\\r\\nis not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may discriminate.\\r\\nWhen a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and\\r\\nthe usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a\\r\\nlove matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved.\\r\\nBut here she comes in person to resolve our doubts.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to\\r\\nannounce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small\\r\\nblack figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and,\\r\\nhaving closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in\\r\\nthe minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do you not find,” he said, “that with your short sight it is\\r\\na little trying to do so much typewriting?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I did at first,” she answered, “but now I know where the\\r\\nletters are without looking.” Then, suddenly realising the full purport\\r\\nof his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and\\r\\nastonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. “You’ve heard\\r\\nabout me, Mr. Holmes,” she cried, “else how could you know all\\r\\nthat?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Never mind,” said Holmes, laughing; “it is my business to\\r\\nknow things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not,\\r\\nwhy should you come to consult me?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose\\r\\nhusband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for\\r\\ndead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I’m not rich,\\r\\nbut still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that I\\r\\nmake by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr.\\r\\nHosmer Angel.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?” asked\\r\\nSherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAgain a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary\\r\\nSutherland. “Yes, I did bang out of the house,” she said,\\r\\n“for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr.\\r\\nWindibank—that is, my father—took it all. He would not go to the\\r\\npolice, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and\\r\\nkept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with\\r\\nmy things and came right away to you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your father,” said Holmes, “your stepfather, surely, since\\r\\nthe name is different.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for\\r\\nhe is only five years and two months older than myself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And your mother is alive?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn’t best pleased, Mr.\\r\\nHolmes, when she married again so soon after father’s death, and a man\\r\\nwho was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the\\r\\nTottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother\\r\\ncarried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her\\r\\nsell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They\\r\\ngot Â£ 4700 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn’t near as much as\\r\\nfather could have got if he had been alive.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and\\r\\ninconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the\\r\\ngreatest concentration of attention.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your own little income,” he asked, “does it come out of the\\r\\nbusiness?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in\\r\\nAuckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4Â½ per cent. Two thousand five\\r\\nhundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You interest me extremely,” said Holmes. “And since you draw\\r\\nso large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no\\r\\ndoubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a\\r\\nsingle lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about Â£ 60.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that\\r\\nas long as I live at home I don’t wish to be a burden to them, and so\\r\\nthey have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of course,\\r\\nthat is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter\\r\\nand pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I\\r\\nearn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from\\r\\nfifteen to twenty sheets in a day.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You have made your position very clear to me,” said Holmes.\\r\\n“This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as\\r\\nbefore myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer\\r\\nAngel.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA flush stole over Miss Sutherland’s face, and she picked nervously at\\r\\nthe fringe of her jacket. “I met him first at the gasfitters’\\r\\nball,” she said. “They used to send father tickets when he was\\r\\nalive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr.\\r\\nWindibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would\\r\\nget quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this\\r\\ntime I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He\\r\\nsaid the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father’s friends were\\r\\nto be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple\\r\\nplush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when\\r\\nnothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but\\r\\nwe went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was\\r\\nthere I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I suppose,” said Holmes, “that when Mr. Windibank came back\\r\\nfrom France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and\\r\\nshrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman,\\r\\nfor she would have her way.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I see. Then at the gasfitters’ ball you met, as I understand, a\\r\\ngentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had\\r\\ngot home all safe, and after that we met him—that is to say, Mr. Holmes,\\r\\nI met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr.\\r\\nHosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, you know father didn’t like anything of the sort. He\\r\\nwouldn’t have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a\\r\\nwoman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to\\r\\nmother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine\\r\\nyet.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see\\r\\nyou?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote\\r\\nand said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had\\r\\ngone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I took\\r\\nthe letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took.\\r\\nHosmer—Mr. Angel—was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall\\r\\nStreet—and—”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What office?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That’s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don’t know.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Where did he live, then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He slept on the premises.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And you don’t know his address?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No—except that it was Leadenhall Street.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Where did you address your letters, then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He\\r\\nsaid that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other\\r\\nclerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like\\r\\nhe did his, but he wouldn’t have that, for he said that when I wrote them\\r\\nthey seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that\\r\\nthe machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me,\\r\\nMr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think of.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was most suggestive,” said Holmes. “It has long been an\\r\\naxiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you\\r\\nremember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the\\r\\nevening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very\\r\\nretiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He’d had the\\r\\nquinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him\\r\\nwith a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was\\r\\nalways well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine\\r\\nare, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned to\\r\\nFrance?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should\\r\\nmarry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear,\\r\\nwith my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be true\\r\\nto him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign\\r\\nof his passion. Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder\\r\\nof him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began\\r\\nto ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to\\r\\ntell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I\\r\\ndidn’t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his\\r\\nleave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn’t want to do\\r\\nanything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has\\r\\nits French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the\\r\\nwedding.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It missed him, then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the\\r\\nFriday. Was it to be in church?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour’s, near\\r\\nKing’s Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras\\r\\nHotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he put us\\r\\nboth into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the\\r\\nonly other cab in the street. We got to the church first, and when the\\r\\nfour-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when\\r\\nthe cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there! The cabman\\r\\nsaid that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get\\r\\nin with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen\\r\\nor heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,” said\\r\\nHolmes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the\\r\\nmorning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that\\r\\neven if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to\\r\\nremember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner\\r\\nor later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened\\r\\nsince gives a meaning to it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen\\r\\ncatastrophe has occurred to him?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not\\r\\nhave talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But you have no notion as to what it could have been?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“None.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“One more question. How did your mother take the matter?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter\\r\\nagain.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And your father? Did you tell him?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and\\r\\nthat I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could anyone have\\r\\nin bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had\\r\\nborrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him,\\r\\nthere might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and\\r\\nnever would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened? And\\r\\nwhy could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I\\r\\ncan’t sleep a wink at night.” She pulled a little handkerchief out\\r\\nof her muff and began to sob heavily into it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I shall glance into the case for you,” said Holmes, rising,\\r\\n“and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the\\r\\nweight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it\\r\\nfurther. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he\\r\\nhas done from your life.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then you don’t think I’ll see him again?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I fear not.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then what has happened to him?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate\\r\\ndescription of him and any letters of his which you can spare.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I advertised for him in last Saturday’s Chronicle,”\\r\\nsaid she. “Here is the slip and here are four letters from him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thank you. And your address?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Angel’s address you never had, I understand. Where is your\\r\\nfather’s place of business?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of\\r\\nFenchurch Street.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave the\\r\\npapers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let the whole\\r\\nincident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true to\\r\\nHosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFor all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something noble in\\r\\nthe simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect. She laid her\\r\\nlittle bundle of papers upon the table and went her way, with a promise to come\\r\\nagain whenever she might be summoned.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed\\r\\ntogether, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward\\r\\nto the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe,\\r\\nwhich was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his\\r\\nchair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of\\r\\ninfinite languor in his face.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Quite an interesting study, that maiden,” he observed. “I\\r\\nfound her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is\\r\\nrather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in\\r\\nAndover in ’77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last\\r\\nyear. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new\\r\\nto me. But the maiden herself was most instructive.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to\\r\\nme,” I remarked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and\\r\\nso you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to realise the\\r\\nimportance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues\\r\\nthat may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that\\r\\nwoman’s appearance? Describe it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather\\r\\nof a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a\\r\\nfringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than\\r\\ncoffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves\\r\\nwere greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I\\r\\ndidn’t observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general\\r\\nair of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“’Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You\\r\\nhave really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everything\\r\\nof importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for\\r\\ncolour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself\\r\\nupon details. My first glance is always at a woman’s sleeve. In a man it\\r\\nis perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this\\r\\nwoman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing\\r\\ntraces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses\\r\\nagainst the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand\\r\\ntype, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it\\r\\nfarthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as\\r\\nthis was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at\\r\\neither side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting,\\r\\nwhich seemed to surprise her.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It surprised me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested on\\r\\nglancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not\\r\\nunlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly\\r\\ndecorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two\\r\\nlower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now,\\r\\nwhen you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from\\r\\nhome with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she\\r\\ncame away in a hurry.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And what else?” I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my\\r\\nfriend’s incisive reasoning.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but\\r\\nafter being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the\\r\\nforefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were\\r\\nstained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too\\r\\ndeep. It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon\\r\\nthe finger. All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back\\r\\nto business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised description of\\r\\nMr. Hosmer Angel?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI held the little printed slip to the light. “Missing,” it said,\\r\\n“on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About\\r\\nfive ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a\\r\\nlittle bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted\\r\\nglasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in black\\r\\nfrock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and grey Harris\\r\\ntweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots. Known to have been\\r\\nemployed in an office in Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing,” &c,\\r\\n&c.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That will do,” said Holmes. “As to the letters,” he\\r\\ncontinued, glancing over them, “they are very commonplace. Absolutely no\\r\\nclue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one\\r\\nremarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They are typewritten,” I remarked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat little\\r\\n‘Hosmer Angel’ at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no\\r\\nsuperscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The point about\\r\\nthe signature is very suggestive—in fact, we may call it\\r\\nconclusive.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Of what?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon\\r\\nthe case?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny\\r\\nhis signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which\\r\\nshould settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the\\r\\nyoung lady’s stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meet\\r\\nus here at six o’clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well that we\\r\\nshould do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing\\r\\nuntil the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon\\r\\nthe shelf for the interim.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI had had so many reasons to believe in my friend’s subtle powers of\\r\\nreasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have some\\r\\nsolid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the\\r\\nsingular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known\\r\\nhim to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler\\r\\nphotograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four,\\r\\nand the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt\\r\\nthat it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that\\r\\nwhen I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands\\r\\nall the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing\\r\\nbridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time,\\r\\nand the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. It was not\\r\\nuntil close upon six o’clock that I found myself free and was able to\\r\\nspring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too\\r\\nlate to assist at the dÃ©nouement of the little mystery. I found Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the\\r\\nrecesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with\\r\\nthe pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his\\r\\nday in the chemical work which was so dear to him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, have you solved it?” I asked as I entered.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, no, the mystery!” I cried.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There was\\r\\nnever any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the\\r\\ndetails are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no law, I fear,\\r\\nthat can touch the scoundrel.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss\\r\\nSutherland?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lips\\r\\nto reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This is the girl’s stepfather, Mr. James Windibank,” said\\r\\nHolmes. “He has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come\\r\\nin!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of\\r\\nage, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a\\r\\npair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning\\r\\nglance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a\\r\\nslight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank,” said Holmes. “I think\\r\\nthat this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with\\r\\nme for six o’clock?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own\\r\\nmaster, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this\\r\\nlittle matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in\\r\\npublic. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very\\r\\nexcitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily\\r\\ncontrolled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind\\r\\nyou so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not\\r\\npleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a\\r\\nuseless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On the contrary,” said Holmes quietly; “I have every reason\\r\\nto believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. “I am\\r\\ndelighted to hear it,” he said.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is a curious thing,” remarked Holmes, “that a typewriter\\r\\nhas really quite as much individuality as a man’s handwriting. Unless\\r\\nthey are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more\\r\\nworn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in this note\\r\\nof yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over\\r\\nof the ‘e,’ and a slight defect in the tail of the ‘r.’\\r\\nThere are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more\\r\\nobvious.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no\\r\\ndoubt it is a little worn,” our visitor answered, glancing keenly at\\r\\nHolmes with his bright little eyes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr.\\r\\nWindibank,” Holmes continued. “I think of writing another little\\r\\nmonograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It is\\r\\na subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have here four\\r\\nletters which purport to come from the missing man. They are all typewritten.\\r\\nIn each case, not only are the ‘e’s’ slurred and the\\r\\n‘r’s’ tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my\\r\\nmagnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have\\r\\nalluded are there as well.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. “I cannot\\r\\nwaste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,” he said.\\r\\n“If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done\\r\\nit.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Certainly,” said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the\\r\\ndoor. “I let you know, then, that I have caught him!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What! where?” shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and\\r\\nglancing about him like a rat in a trap.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, it won’t do—really it won’t,” said Holmes\\r\\nsuavely. “There is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is\\r\\nquite too transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it\\r\\nwas impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That’s right! Sit\\r\\ndown and let us talk it over.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOur visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter of\\r\\nmoisture on his brow. “It—it’s not actionable,” he\\r\\nstammered.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves, Windibank,\\r\\nit was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came\\r\\nbefore me. Now, let me just run over the course of events, and you will\\r\\ncontradict me if I go wrong.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, like\\r\\none who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the\\r\\nmantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking,\\r\\nrather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The man married a woman very much older than himself for her\\r\\nmoney,” said he, “and he enjoyed the use of the money of the\\r\\ndaughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people\\r\\nin their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It\\r\\nwas worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable\\r\\ndisposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was\\r\\nevident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she\\r\\nwould not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of\\r\\ncourse, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent\\r\\nit? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to\\r\\nseek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would\\r\\nnot answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally\\r\\nannounced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her\\r\\nclever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head\\r\\nthan to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised\\r\\nhimself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a\\r\\nmoustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an\\r\\ninsinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl’s short\\r\\nsight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making\\r\\nlove himself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was only a joke at first,” groaned our visitor. “We never\\r\\nthought that she would have been so carried away.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly\\r\\ncarried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in\\r\\nFrance, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She\\r\\nwas flattered by the gentleman’s attentions, and the effect was increased\\r\\nby the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call,\\r\\nfor it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a\\r\\nreal effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which\\r\\nwould finally secure the girl’s affections from turning towards anyone\\r\\nelse. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys\\r\\nto France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the\\r\\nbusiness to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent\\r\\nimpression upon the young lady’s mind and prevent her from looking upon\\r\\nany other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted\\r\\nupon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something\\r\\nhappening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss\\r\\nSutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate,\\r\\nthat for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man.\\r\\nAs far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther,\\r\\nhe conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a\\r\\nfour-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr.\\r\\nWindibank!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOur visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been\\r\\ntalking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “but if\\r\\nyou are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who\\r\\nare breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from the\\r\\nfirst, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an\\r\\naction for assault and illegal constraint.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The law cannot, as you say, touch you,” said Holmes, unlocking and\\r\\nthrowing open the door, “yet there never was a man who deserved\\r\\npunishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a\\r\\nwhip across your shoulders. By Jove!” he continued, flushing up at the\\r\\nsight of the bitter sneer upon the man’s face, “it is not part of\\r\\nmy duties to my client, but here’s a hunting crop handy, and I think I\\r\\nshall just treat myself to—” He took two swift steps to the whip,\\r\\nbut before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs,\\r\\nthe heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr. James\\r\\nWindibank running at the top of his speed down the road.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There’s a cold-blooded scoundrel!” said Holmes, laughing, as\\r\\nhe threw himself down into his chair once more. “That fellow will rise\\r\\nfrom crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows.\\r\\nThe case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,” I\\r\\nremarked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer Angel\\r\\nmust have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear\\r\\nthat the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see,\\r\\nwas the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together, but\\r\\nthat the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were\\r\\nthe tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise,\\r\\nas did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar\\r\\naction in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his\\r\\nhandwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest\\r\\nsample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones,\\r\\nall pointed in the same direction.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And how did you verify them?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew the\\r\\nfirm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed description. I\\r\\neliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise—the\\r\\nwhiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request\\r\\nthat they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of\\r\\ntheir travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter,\\r\\nand I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would\\r\\ncome here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same\\r\\ntrivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from\\r\\nWesthouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description\\r\\ntallied in every respect with that of their employÃ©, James Windibank. VoilÃ\\xa0\\r\\ntout!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And Miss Sutherland?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If I tell her she will not believe me.

Of these the latter may have afforded a\\r\\nfiner field for an acute and original observer, but the other was so strange in\\r\\nits inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of\\r\\nbeing placed upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those\\r\\ndeductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results.\\r\\nThe story has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but, like\\r\\nall such narratives, its effect is much less striking when set forth en\\r\\nbloc in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly evolve\\r\\nbefore your own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually away as each new\\r\\ndiscovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth. At the time\\r\\nthe circumstances made a deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years\\r\\nhas hardly served to weaken the effect.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was in the summer of ’89, not long after my marriage, that the events\\r\\noccurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned to civil practice\\r\\nand had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms, although I\\r\\ncontinually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his\\r\\nBohemian habits so far as to come and visit us. My practice had steadily\\r\\nincreased, and as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington\\r\\nStation, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of these, whom I\\r\\nhad cured of a painful and lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my\\r\\nvirtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might\\r\\nhave any influence.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOne morning, at a little before seven o’clock, I was awakened by the maid\\r\\ntapping at the door to announce that two men had come from Paddington and were\\r\\nwaiting in the consulting-room. I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience\\r\\nthat railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I\\r\\ndescended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door\\r\\ntightly behind him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’ve got him here,” he whispered, jerking his thumb over his\\r\\nshoulder; “he’s all right.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What is it, then?” I asked, for his manner suggested that it was\\r\\nsome strange creature which he had caged up in my room.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It’s a new patient,” he whispered. “I thought\\r\\nI’d bring him round myself; then he couldn’t slip away. There he\\r\\nis, all safe and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same\\r\\nas you.” And off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time\\r\\nto thank him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table. He was\\r\\nquietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had\\r\\nlaid down upon my books. Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped,\\r\\nwhich was mottled all over with bloodstains. He was young, not more than\\r\\nfive-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was\\r\\nexceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from\\r\\nsome strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,” said he, “but\\r\\nI have had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by train this\\r\\nmorning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor, a\\r\\nworthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a card, but I see\\r\\nthat she has left it upon the side-table.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI took it up and glanced at it. “Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic\\r\\nengineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor).” That was the name, style,\\r\\nand abode of my morning visitor. “I regret that I have kept you\\r\\nwaiting,” said I, sitting down in my library-chair. “You are fresh\\r\\nfrom a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous\\r\\noccupation.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, my night could not be called monotonous,” said he, and\\r\\nlaughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in\\r\\nhis chair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against that\\r\\nlaugh.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Stop it!” I cried; “pull yourself together!” and I\\r\\npoured out some water from a caraffe.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which\\r\\ncome upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone. Presently he\\r\\ncame to himself once more, very weary and pale-looking.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have been making a fool of myself,” he gasped.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not at all. Drink this.” I dashed some brandy into the water, and\\r\\nthe colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That’s better!” said he. “And now, Doctor, perhaps you\\r\\nwould kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to\\r\\nbe.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my hardened\\r\\nnerves a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding fingers and a horrid\\r\\nred, spongy surface where the thumb should have been. It had been hacked or\\r\\ntorn right out from the roots.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens!” I cried, “this is a terrible injury. It must\\r\\nhave bled considerably.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have\\r\\nbeen senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that it was still\\r\\nbleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and\\r\\nbraced it up with a twig.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Excellent! You should have been a surgeon.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own\\r\\nprovince.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This has been done,” said I, examining the wound, “by a very\\r\\nheavy and sharp instrument.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A thing like a cleaver,” said he.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“An accident, I presume?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“By no means.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What! a murderous attack?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very murderous indeed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You horrify me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it over with\\r\\ncotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back without wincing, though he\\r\\nbit his lip from time to time.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How is that?” I asked when I had finished.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man. I was\\r\\nvery weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying\\r\\nto your nerves.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but,\\r\\nbetween ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of\\r\\nmine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement, for it is a very\\r\\nextraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof with which to back\\r\\nit up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are so\\r\\nvague that it is a question whether justice will be done.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ha!” cried I, “if it is anything in the nature of a problem\\r\\nwhich you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my\\r\\nfriend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the official police.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I have heard of that fellow,” answered my visitor, “and\\r\\nI should be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must\\r\\nuse the official police as well. Would you give me an introduction to\\r\\nhim?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’ll do better. I’ll take you round to him myself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I should be immensely obliged to you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We’ll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to have\\r\\na little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an\\r\\ninstant.” I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife, and\\r\\nin five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new acquaintance to Baker\\r\\nStreet.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in his\\r\\ndressing-gown, reading the agony column of The Times and smoking his\\r\\nbefore-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left\\r\\nfrom his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and collected on the\\r\\ncorner of the mantelpiece. He received us in his quietly genial fashion,\\r\\nordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal. When it was\\r\\nconcluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa, placed a pillow\\r\\nbeneath his head, and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr.\\r\\nHatherley,” said he. “Pray, lie down there and make yourself\\r\\nabsolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep\\r\\nup your strength with a little stimulant.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thank you,” said my patient, “but I have felt another man\\r\\nsince the doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the\\r\\ncure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I shall\\r\\nstart at once upon my peculiar experiences.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHolmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression which\\r\\nveiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him, and we listened\\r\\nin silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You must know,” said he, “that I am an orphan and a\\r\\nbachelor, residing alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a hydraulic\\r\\nengineer, and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven\\r\\nyears that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, of\\r\\nGreenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having also come into a\\r\\nfair sum of money through my poor father’s death, I determined to start\\r\\nin business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria Street.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a\\r\\ndreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two years I have\\r\\nhad three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all that my\\r\\nprofession has brought me. My gross takings amount to Â£ 27 10s. Every\\r\\nday, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my\\r\\nlittle den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to believe that I\\r\\nshould never have any practice at all.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my\\r\\nclerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon\\r\\nbusiness. He brought up a card, too, with the name of ‘Colonel Lysander\\r\\nStark’ engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel himself, a\\r\\nman rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think\\r\\nthat I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose\\r\\nand chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding\\r\\nbones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no\\r\\ndisease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He\\r\\nwas plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer\\r\\nforty than thirty.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Mr. Hatherley?’ said he, with something of a German\\r\\naccent. ‘You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man\\r\\nwho is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable\\r\\nof preserving a secret.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address.\\r\\n‘May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that\\r\\njust at this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan\\r\\nand a bachelor and are residing alone in London.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘That is quite correct,’ I answered; ‘but you\\r\\nwill excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my\\r\\nprofessional qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter\\r\\nthat you wished to speak to me?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really\\r\\nto the point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy is\\r\\nquite essential—absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we may\\r\\nexpect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom\\r\\nof his family.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘If I promise to keep a secret,’ said I, ‘you\\r\\nmay absolutely depend upon my doing so.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had\\r\\nnever seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Do you promise, then?’ said he at last.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Yes, I promise.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No\\r\\nreference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I have already given you my word.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Very good.’ He suddenly sprang up, and darting like\\r\\nlightning across the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was\\r\\nempty.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘That’s all right,’ said he, coming back.\\r\\n‘I know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master’s\\r\\naffairs. Now we can talk in safety.’ He drew up his chair very close to\\r\\nmine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful\\r\\nlook.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to rise\\r\\nwithin me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. Even my dread of losing\\r\\na client could not restrain me from showing my impatience.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I beg that you will state your business, sir,’ said\\r\\nI; ‘my time is of value.’ Heaven forgive me for that last sentence,\\r\\nbut the words came to my lips.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘How would fifty guineas for a night’s work suit\\r\\nyou?’ he asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Most admirably.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I say a night’s work, but an hour’s would be\\r\\nnearer the mark. I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine\\r\\nwhich has got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it\\r\\nright ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as that?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the\\r\\nlast train.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Where to?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the\\r\\nborders of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a train\\r\\nfrom Paddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Very good.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘There is a drive, then?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a\\r\\ngood seven miles from Eyford Station.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose\\r\\nthere would be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop the\\r\\nnight.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more\\r\\nconvenient hour?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to\\r\\nrecompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and\\r\\nunknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your\\r\\nprofession. Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the business,\\r\\nthere is plenty of time to do so.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be to\\r\\nme. ‘Not at all,’ said I, ‘I shall be very happy to\\r\\naccommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to understand a\\r\\nlittle more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy\\r\\nwhich we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I have no\\r\\nwish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. I\\r\\nsuppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Entirely.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that\\r\\nfuller’s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one or\\r\\ntwo places in England?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I have heard so.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Some little time ago I bought a small place—a very\\r\\nsmall place—within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to\\r\\ndiscover that there was a deposit of fuller’s-earth in one of my fields.\\r\\nOn examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small\\r\\none, and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right\\r\\nand left—both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These\\r\\ngood people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was\\r\\nquite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my interest to buy their\\r\\nland before they discovered its true value, but unfortunately I had no capital\\r\\nby which I could do this. I took a few of my friends into the secret, however,\\r\\nand they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little\\r\\ndeposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to\\r\\nbuy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been doing for some time, and in\\r\\norder to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This press, as\\r\\nI have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon\\r\\nthe subject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it once became\\r\\nknown that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house, it would soon\\r\\nrouse inquiry, and then, if the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any\\r\\nchance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have\\r\\nmade you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to\\r\\nEyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I quite follow you,’ said I. ‘The only point\\r\\nwhich I could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic\\r\\npress in excavating fuller’s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out\\r\\nlike gravel from a pit.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Ah!’ said he carelessly, ‘we have our own\\r\\nprocess. We compress the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without\\r\\nrevealing what they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into\\r\\nmy confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.’\\r\\nHe rose as he spoke. ‘I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at\\r\\n11:15.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I shall certainly be there.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘And not a word to a soul.’ He looked at me with a\\r\\nlast long, questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp,\\r\\nhe hurried from the room.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much\\r\\nastonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had been\\r\\nintrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the fee was at\\r\\nleast tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price upon my own services,\\r\\nand it was possible that this order might lead to other ones. On the other\\r\\nhand, the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon\\r\\nme, and I could not think that his explanation of the fuller’s-earth was\\r\\nsufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme\\r\\nanxiety lest I should tell anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to\\r\\nthe winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off, having\\r\\nobeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station. However,\\r\\nI was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the little dim-lit\\r\\nstation after eleven o’clock. I was the only passenger who got out there,\\r\\nand there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a\\r\\nlantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate, however, I found my\\r\\nacquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without\\r\\na word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door of which was\\r\\nstanding open. He drew up the windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work,\\r\\nand away we went as fast as the horse could go.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“One horse?” interjected Holmes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, only one.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Did you observe the colour?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the carriage.\\r\\nIt was a chestnut.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Tired-looking or fresh?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, fresh and glossy.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most\\r\\ninteresting statement.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander\\r\\nStark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from the rate\\r\\nthat we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it must have been\\r\\nnearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more\\r\\nthan once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me with great\\r\\nintensity. The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the\\r\\nworld, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows\\r\\nto see something of where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I\\r\\ncould make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now\\r\\nand then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but the\\r\\ncolonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon flagged. At\\r\\nlast, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness\\r\\nof a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark\\r\\nsprang out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which\\r\\ngaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and\\r\\ninto the hall, so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front\\r\\nof the house. The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed\\r\\nheavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage\\r\\ndrove away.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about\\r\\nlooking for matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door opened at\\r\\nthe other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light shot out in our\\r\\ndirection. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which\\r\\nshe held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us. I could\\r\\nsee that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her\\r\\ndark dress I knew that it was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a\\r\\nforeign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and when my companion\\r\\nanswered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly\\r\\nfell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her\\r\\near, and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he\\r\\nwalked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for\\r\\na few minutes,’ said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet,\\r\\nlittle, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which\\r\\nseveral German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the\\r\\ntop of a harmonium beside the door. ‘I shall not keep you waiting an\\r\\ninstant,’ said he, and vanished into the darkness.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of\\r\\nGerman I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the others being\\r\\nvolumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window, hoping that I might\\r\\ncatch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was\\r\\nfolded across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old clock\\r\\nticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise everything was deadly\\r\\nstill. A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these\\r\\nGerman people, and what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way\\r\\nplace? And where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all\\r\\nI knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that matter,\\r\\nReading, and possibly other large towns, were within that radius, so the place\\r\\nmight not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was quite certain, from the\\r\\nabsolute stillness, that we were in the country. I paced up and down the room,\\r\\nhumming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was\\r\\nthoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter\\r\\nstillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was standing in the\\r\\naperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp\\r\\nbeating upon her eager and beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was\\r\\nsick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one\\r\\nshaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words of\\r\\nbroken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse,\\r\\ninto the gloom behind her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I would go,’ said she, trying hard, as it seemed to\\r\\nme, to speak calmly; ‘I would go. I should not stay here. There is no\\r\\ngood for you to do.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘But, madam,’ said I, ‘I have not yet done what\\r\\nI came for. I cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘It is not worth your while to wait,’ she went on.\\r\\n‘You can pass through the door; no one hinders.’ And then, seeing\\r\\nthat I smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and\\r\\nmade a step forward, with her hands wrung together. ‘For the love of\\r\\nHeaven!’ she whispered, ‘get away from here before it is too\\r\\nlate!’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage in\\r\\nan affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my fifty-guinea\\r\\nfee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be\\r\\nbefore me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having\\r\\ncarried out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This woman\\r\\nmight, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though\\r\\nher manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head\\r\\nand declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew her\\r\\nentreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps was\\r\\nheard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up her hands with a\\r\\ndespairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had\\r\\ncome.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a\\r\\nchinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was\\r\\nintroduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘This is my secretary and manager,’ said the colonel.\\r\\n‘By the way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just\\r\\nnow. I fear that you have felt the draught.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘On the contrary,’ said I, ‘I opened the door\\r\\nmyself because I felt the room to be a little close.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. ‘Perhaps we had better\\r\\nproceed to business, then,’ said he. ‘Mr. Ferguson and I will take\\r\\nyou up to see the machine.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I had better put my hat on, I suppose.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Oh, no, it is in the house.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘What, you dig fuller’s-earth in the house?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind\\r\\nthat. All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what\\r\\nis wrong with it.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat\\r\\nmanager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with corridors,\\r\\npassages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the thresholds of\\r\\nwhich were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them. There were no\\r\\ncarpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster\\r\\nwas peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in green,\\r\\nunhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I\\r\\nhad not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and\\r\\nI kept a keen eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and\\r\\nsilent man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least a\\r\\nfellow-countryman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he\\r\\nunlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us could\\r\\nhardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the colonel ushered me\\r\\nin.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘We are now,’ said he, ‘actually within the\\r\\nhydraulic press, and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if\\r\\nanyone were to turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end\\r\\nof the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon\\r\\nthis metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside which\\r\\nreceive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is\\r\\nfamiliar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness\\r\\nin the working of it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will\\r\\nhave the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it\\r\\nright.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly. It\\r\\nwas indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous pressure. When I\\r\\npassed outside, however, and pressed down the levers which controlled it, I\\r\\nknew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which\\r\\nallowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An\\r\\nexamination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was round the head\\r\\nof a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it\\r\\nworked. This was clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out\\r\\nto my companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several\\r\\npractical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I had\\r\\nmade it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a\\r\\ngood look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was obvious at a glance that\\r\\nthe story of the fuller’s-earth was the merest fabrication, for it would\\r\\nbe absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so\\r\\ninadequate a purpose. The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a\\r\\nlarge iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a crust of\\r\\nmetallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was scraping at this to see\\r\\nexactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the\\r\\ncadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘What are you doing there?’ he asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that\\r\\nwhich he had told me. ‘I was admiring your fuller’s-earth,’\\r\\nsaid I; ‘I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your\\r\\nmachine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my\\r\\nspeech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Very well,’ said he, ‘you shall know all about\\r\\nthe machine.’ He took a step backward, slammed the little door, and\\r\\nturned the key in the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but\\r\\nit was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves.\\r\\n‘Hullo!’ I yelled. ‘Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart\\r\\ninto my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking\\r\\ncylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood upon the floor\\r\\nwhere I had placed it when examining the trough. By its light I saw that the\\r\\nblack ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew\\r\\nbetter than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a\\r\\nshapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged with\\r\\nmy nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless\\r\\nclanking of the levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two\\r\\nabove my head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface.\\r\\nThen it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very\\r\\nmuch upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the weight would\\r\\ncome upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap. Easier the\\r\\nother way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly\\r\\nblack shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand erect, when\\r\\nmy eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls\\r\\nwere of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line of\\r\\nyellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and broadened as a\\r\\nsmall panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could hardly believe that\\r\\nhere was indeed a door which led away from death. The next instant I threw\\r\\nmyself through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had closed\\r\\nagain behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few moments afterwards the\\r\\nclang of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had been my escape.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I found\\r\\nmyself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent over\\r\\nme and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a candle in her right.\\r\\nIt was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Come! come!’ she cried breathlessly. ‘They will\\r\\nbe here in a moment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the\\r\\nso-precious time, but come!’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my feet\\r\\nand ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The latter led to\\r\\nanother broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running\\r\\nfeet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other from the floor on\\r\\nwhich  we were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about her\\r\\nlike one  who is at her wit’s end. Then she threw open a door which led\\r\\ninto a bedroom, through the window of which the moon was shining brightly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘It is your only chance,’ said she. ‘It is high,\\r\\nbut it may be that you can jump it.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage,\\r\\nand I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a\\r\\nlantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher’s cleaver in the other. I\\r\\nrushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and\\r\\nsweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be\\r\\nmore than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to\\r\\njump until I should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian\\r\\nwho pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to go\\r\\nback to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before\\r\\nhe was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round him\\r\\nand tried to hold him back.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Fritz! Fritz!’ she cried in English, ‘remember\\r\\nyour promise after the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be\\r\\nsilent! Oh, he will be silent!’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You are mad, Elise!’ he shouted, struggling to break\\r\\naway from her. ‘You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me\\r\\npass, I say!’ He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut\\r\\nat me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands\\r\\nto the sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip\\r\\nloosened, and I fell into the garden below.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and rushed\\r\\noff among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood that I was far\\r\\nfrom being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness\\r\\nand sickness came over me. I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing\\r\\npainfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and\\r\\nthat the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief\\r\\nround it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in\\r\\na dead faint among the rose-bushes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been a very\\r\\nlong time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was breaking when I came\\r\\nto myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched\\r\\nwith blood from my wounded thumb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all\\r\\nthe particulars of my night’s adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the\\r\\nfeeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But to my\\r\\nastonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house nor garden were to be\\r\\nseen. I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the high road, and just\\r\\na little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it,\\r\\nto be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. Were it\\r\\nnot for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dreadful\\r\\nhours might have been an evil dream.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train.\\r\\nThere would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was on\\r\\nduty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him whether he\\r\\nhad ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he\\r\\nobserved a carriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was there\\r\\na police-station anywhere near? There was one about three miles off.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to wait\\r\\nuntil I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It was a little\\r\\npast six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound dressed, and then the\\r\\ndoctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I put the case into your hands\\r\\nand shall do exactly what you advise.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this\\r\\nextraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of\\r\\nthe ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Here is an advertisement which will interest you,” said he.\\r\\n“It appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this:\\r\\n‘Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a\\r\\nhydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o’clock at night, and has\\r\\nnot been heard of since. Was dressed in,’ etc., etc. Ha! That represents\\r\\nthe last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I\\r\\nfancy.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens!” cried my patient. “Then that explains what\\r\\nthe girl said.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate\\r\\nman, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his\\r\\nlittle game, like those out-and-out pirates who will leave no survivor from a\\r\\ncaptured ship. Well, every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it\\r\\nwe shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for\\r\\nEyford.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSome three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together, bound from\\r\\nReading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock Holmes, the\\r\\nhydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes\\r\\nman, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon\\r\\nthe seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford for its\\r\\ncentre.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There you are,” said he. “That circle is drawn at a radius\\r\\nof ten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near that\\r\\nline. You said ten miles, I think, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was an hour’s good drive.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And you think that they brought you back all that way when you were\\r\\nunconscious?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been\\r\\nlifted and conveyed somewhere.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What I cannot understand,” said I, “is why they should have\\r\\nspared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the\\r\\nvillain was softened by the woman’s entreaties.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my\\r\\nlife.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,” said Bradstreet.\\r\\n“Well, I have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon\\r\\nit the folk that we are in search of are to be found.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I think I could lay my finger on it,” said Holmes quietly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Really, now!” cried the inspector, “you have formed your\\r\\nopinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for\\r\\nthe country is more deserted there.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I say east,” said my patient.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am for west,” remarked the plain-clothes man. “There are\\r\\nseveral quiet little villages up there.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I am for north,” said I, “because there are no hills\\r\\nthere, and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up\\r\\nany.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Come,” cried the inspector, laughing; “it’s a very\\r\\npretty diversity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you\\r\\ngive your casting vote to?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are all wrong.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But we can’t all be.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes, you can. This is my point.” He placed his finger in the\\r\\ncentre of the circle. “This is where we shall find them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But the twelve-mile drive?” gasped Hatherley.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse\\r\\nwas fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had gone\\r\\ntwelve miles over heavy roads?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,” observed Bradstreet\\r\\nthoughtfully. “Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this\\r\\ngang.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“None at all,” said Holmes. “They are coiners on a large\\r\\nscale, and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place\\r\\nof silver.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,” said\\r\\nthe inspector. “They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand.\\r\\nWe even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they had\\r\\ncovered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands. But\\r\\nnow, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right\\r\\nenough.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined to fall\\r\\ninto the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic\\r\\ncolumn of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the\\r\\nneighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A house on fire?” asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again\\r\\non its way.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir!” said the station-master.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When did it break out?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and the\\r\\nwhole place is in a blaze.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Whose house is it?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Dr. Becher’s.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Tell me,” broke in the engineer, “is Dr. Becher a German,\\r\\nvery thin, with a long, sharp nose?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe station-master laughed heartily. “No, sir, Dr. Becher is an\\r\\nEnglishman, and there isn’t a man in the parish who has a better-lined\\r\\nwaistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I understand,\\r\\nwho is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would do\\r\\nhim no harm.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in\\r\\nthe direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and there was a great\\r\\nwidespread whitewashed building in front of us, spouting fire at every chink\\r\\nand window, while in the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly\\r\\nstriving to keep the flames under.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That’s it!” cried Hatherley, in intense excitement.\\r\\n“There is the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay.\\r\\nThat second window is the one that I jumped from.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, at least,” said Holmes, “you have had your revenge\\r\\nupon them. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it\\r\\nwas crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt they\\r\\nwere too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time. Now keep\\r\\nyour eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night, though I very much\\r\\nfear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Holmes’ fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no word\\r\\nhas ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or the\\r\\nmorose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing\\r\\nseveral people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of\\r\\nReading, but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even\\r\\nHolmes’ ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their\\r\\nwhereabouts.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had\\r\\nfound within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon\\r\\na window-sill of the second floor. About sunset, however, their efforts were at\\r\\nlast successful, and they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had\\r\\nfallen in, and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save\\r\\nsome twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery\\r\\nwhich had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel\\r\\nand of tin were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be\\r\\nfound, which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have\\r\\nbeen already referred to.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHow our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where\\r\\nhe recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for\\r\\nthe soft mould, which told us a very plain tale. He had evidently been carried\\r\\ndown by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other\\r\\nunusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the silent\\r\\nEnglishman, being less bold or less murderous than his companion, had assisted\\r\\nthe woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well,” said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return\\r\\nonce more to London, “it has been a pretty business for me! I have lost\\r\\nmy thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Experience,” said Holmes, laughing. “Indirectly it may be of\\r\\nvalue, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of\\r\\nbeing excellent company for the remainder of your existence.”\\r\\n', '\\nOn glancing over my\\r\\nnotes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years\\r\\nstudied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some\\r\\ncomic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he\\r\\ndid rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he\\r\\nrefused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards\\r\\nthe unusual, and even the fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I\\r\\ncannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was\\r\\nassociated with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran.\\r\\nThe events in question occurred in the early days of my association with\\r\\nHolmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is possible\\r\\nthat I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was\\r\\nmade at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by\\r\\nthe untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It is perhaps as\\r\\nwell that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that\\r\\nthere are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend\\r\\nto make the matter even more terrible than the truth.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was early in April in the year ’83 that I woke one morning to find\\r\\nSherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a late\\r\\nriser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was\\r\\nonly a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps\\r\\njust a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,” said he, “but\\r\\nit’s the common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she\\r\\nretorted upon me, and I on you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What is it, then—a fire?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable\\r\\nstate of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in the\\r\\nsitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour\\r\\nof the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it\\r\\nis something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it prove to\\r\\nbe an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the\\r\\noutset. I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the\\r\\nchance.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional\\r\\ninvestigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions,\\r\\nand yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems\\r\\nwhich were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a\\r\\nfew minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in\\r\\nblack and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we\\r\\nentered.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good-morning, madam,” said Holmes cheerily. “My name is\\r\\nSherlock Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before\\r\\nwhom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs.\\r\\nHudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and I\\r\\nshall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are\\r\\nshivering.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is not cold which makes me shiver,” said the woman in a low\\r\\nvoice, changing her seat as requested.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What, then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.” She raised her veil as she\\r\\nspoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation,\\r\\nher face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some\\r\\nhunted animal. Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her\\r\\nhair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard.\\r\\nSherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You must not fear,” said he soothingly, bending forward and\\r\\npatting her forearm. “We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt.\\r\\nYou have come in by train this morning, I see.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You know me, then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your\\r\\nleft glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a\\r\\ndog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There is no mystery, my dear madam,” said he, smiling. “The\\r\\nleft arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The\\r\\nmarks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up\\r\\nmud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the\\r\\ndriver.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,” said\\r\\nshe. “I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past,\\r\\nand came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no\\r\\nlonger; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to—none,\\r\\nsave only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I\\r\\nhave heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom\\r\\nyou helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had your\\r\\naddress. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least\\r\\nthrow a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me? At present\\r\\nit is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six\\r\\nweeks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least\\r\\nyou shall not find me ungrateful.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHolmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which\\r\\nhe consulted.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Farintosh,” said he. “Ah yes, I recall the case; it was\\r\\nconcerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can\\r\\nonly say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as\\r\\nI did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own reward;\\r\\nbut you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time\\r\\nwhich suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that\\r\\nmay help us in forming an opinion upon the matter.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Alas!” replied our visitor, “the very horror of my situation\\r\\nlies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so\\r\\nentirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he\\r\\nto whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all\\r\\nthat I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so,\\r\\nbut I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have heard,\\r\\nMr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human\\r\\nheart. You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass\\r\\nme.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am all attention, madam.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the\\r\\nlast survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of\\r\\nStoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHolmes nodded his head. “The name is familiar to me,” said he.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the estates\\r\\nextended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in the\\r\\nwest. In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute\\r\\nand wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a\\r\\ngambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of\\r\\nground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a\\r\\nheavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the\\r\\nhorrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather,\\r\\nseeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance\\r\\nfrom a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to\\r\\nCalcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he\\r\\nestablished a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused by some\\r\\nrobberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to\\r\\ndeath and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long\\r\\nterm of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and\\r\\ndisappointed man.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the\\r\\nyoung widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister Julia\\r\\nand I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my\\r\\nmother’s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money—not less\\r\\nthan Â£ 1000 a year—and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while\\r\\nwe resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be\\r\\nallowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return to\\r\\nEngland my mother died—she was killed eight years ago in a railway\\r\\naccident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish\\r\\nhimself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestral\\r\\nhouse at Stoke Moran. The money which my mother had left was enough for all our\\r\\nwants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time. Instead\\r\\nof making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first\\r\\nbeen overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he\\r\\nshut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious\\r\\nquarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper approaching to\\r\\nmania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my\\r\\nstepfather’s case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long\\r\\nresidence in the tropics. A series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of\\r\\nwhich ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the\\r\\nvillage, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense\\r\\nstrength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream,\\r\\nand it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that\\r\\nI was able to avert another public exposure. He had no friends at all save the\\r\\nwandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the\\r\\nfew acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would\\r\\naccept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them\\r\\nsometimes for weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are\\r\\nsent over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a\\r\\nbaboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers\\r\\nalmost as much as their master.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no\\r\\ngreat pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a long time\\r\\nwe did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the time of her death,\\r\\nand yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your sister is dead, then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to speak\\r\\nto you. You can understand that, living the life which I have described, we\\r\\nwere little likely to see anyone of our own age and position. We had, however,\\r\\nan aunt, my mother’s maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives\\r\\nnear Harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this\\r\\nlady’s house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there\\r\\na half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My stepfather learned\\r\\nof the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the\\r\\nmarriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the\\r\\nwedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only\\r\\ncompanion.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his\\r\\nhead sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at\\r\\nhis visitor.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Pray be precise as to details,” said he.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is\\r\\nseared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very old,\\r\\nand only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are on the ground\\r\\nfloor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings. Of these\\r\\nbedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott’s, the second my sister’s, and\\r\\nthe third my own. There is no communication between them, but they all open out\\r\\ninto the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Perfectly so.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal night\\r\\nDr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not retired\\r\\nto rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars\\r\\nwhich it was his custom to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into\\r\\nmine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At\\r\\neleven o’clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and\\r\\nlooked back.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Tell me, Helen,’ said she, ‘have you ever heard\\r\\nanyone whistle in the dead of the night?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Never,’ said I.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in\\r\\nyour sleep?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Certainly not. But why?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Because during the last few nights I have always, about\\r\\nthree in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it\\r\\nhas awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from—perhaps from the next\\r\\nroom, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you whether you\\r\\nhad heard it.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the\\r\\nplantation.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that\\r\\nyou did not hear it also.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.’\\r\\nShe smiled back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key\\r\\nturn in the lock.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Indeed,” said Holmes. “Was it your custom always to lock\\r\\nyourselves in at night?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Always.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And why?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I think that I mentioned to you that the Doctor kept a cheetah and a\\r\\nbaboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune\\r\\nimpressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how\\r\\nsubtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied. It was a\\r\\nwild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and\\r\\nsplashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there\\r\\nburst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew that it was my\\r\\nsister’s voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and\\r\\nrushed into the corridor. As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle,\\r\\nsuch as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a\\r\\nmass of metal had fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister’s door was\\r\\nunlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken,\\r\\nnot knowing what was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp\\r\\nI saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands\\r\\ngroping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard.\\r\\nI ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed\\r\\nto give way and she fell to the ground. She writhed as one who is in terrible\\r\\npain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had\\r\\nnot recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice\\r\\nwhich I shall never forget, ‘Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The\\r\\nspeckled band!’ There was something else which she would fain have said,\\r\\nand she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the\\r\\nDoctor’s room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I\\r\\nrushed out, calling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his\\r\\nroom in his dressing-gown. When he reached my sister’s side she was\\r\\nunconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical\\r\\naid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died\\r\\nwithout having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my\\r\\nbeloved sister.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“One moment,” said Holmes, “are you sure about this whistle\\r\\nand metallic sound? Could you swear to it?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my\\r\\nstrong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the\\r\\ncreaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Was your sister dressed?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the charred\\r\\nstump of a match, and in her left a match-box.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm\\r\\ntook place. That is important. And what conclusions did the coroner come\\r\\nto?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott’s\\r\\nconduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any\\r\\nsatisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been fastened\\r\\nupon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters\\r\\nwith broad iron bars, which were secured every night. The walls were carefully\\r\\nsounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also\\r\\nthoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred\\r\\nup by four large staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite\\r\\nalone when she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon\\r\\nher.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How about poison?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The doctors examined her for it, but without success.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though\\r\\nwhat it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, there are nearly always some there.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band—a\\r\\nspeckled band?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium,\\r\\nsometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these\\r\\nvery gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs\\r\\nwhich so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange\\r\\nadjective which she used.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHolmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“These are very deep waters,” said he; “pray go on with your\\r\\nnarrative.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately\\r\\nlonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for\\r\\nmany years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage. His name is\\r\\nArmitage—Percy Armitage—the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane\\r\\nWater, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and\\r\\nwe are to be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs\\r\\nwere started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been\\r\\npierced, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died,\\r\\nand to sleep in the very bed in which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of\\r\\nterror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I\\r\\nsuddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the\\r\\nherald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be\\r\\nseen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed,\\r\\nand as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn,\\r\\nwhich is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on this\\r\\nmorning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You have done wisely,” said my friend. “But have you told me\\r\\nall?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, all.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, what do you mean?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFor answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand\\r\\nthat lay upon our visitor’s knee. Five little livid spots, the marks of\\r\\nfour fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You have been cruelly used,” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. “He is a\\r\\nhard man,” she said, “and perhaps he hardly knows his own\\r\\nstrength.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands\\r\\nand stared into the crackling fire.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This is a very deep business,” he said at last. “There are a\\r\\nthousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course\\r\\nof action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to Stoke Moran\\r\\nto-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the\\r\\nknowledge of your stepfather?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most\\r\\nimportant business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and that there\\r\\nwould be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now, but she is old and\\r\\nfoolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“By no means.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town.\\r\\nBut I shall return by the twelve o’clock train, so as to be there in time\\r\\nfor your coming.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small\\r\\nbusiness matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my\\r\\ntrouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon.”\\r\\nShe dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And what do you think of it all, Watson?” asked Sherlock Holmes,\\r\\nleaning back in his chair.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Dark enough and sinister enough.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are\\r\\nsound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her sister\\r\\nmust have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very\\r\\npeculiar words of the dying woman?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I cannot think.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band\\r\\nof gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we\\r\\nhave every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his\\r\\nstepdaughter’s marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the\\r\\nfact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been\\r\\ncaused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into\\r\\nits place, I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be\\r\\ncleared along those lines.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But what, then, did the gipsies do?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I cannot imagine.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I see many objections to any such theory.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke\\r\\nMoran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may\\r\\nbe explained away. But what in the name of the devil!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had\\r\\nbeen suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the\\r\\naperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the\\r\\nagricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high\\r\\ngaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his hat\\r\\nactually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span\\r\\nit across from side to side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles,\\r\\nburned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from\\r\\none to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,\\r\\nfleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Which of you is Holmes?” asked this apparition.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,” said my companion\\r\\nquietly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Indeed, Doctor,” said Holmes blandly. “Pray take a\\r\\nseat.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have\\r\\ntraced her. What has she been saying to you?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is a little cold for the time of the year,” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What has she been saying to you?” screamed the old man furiously.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,” continued my\\r\\ncompanion imperturbably.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ha! You put me off, do you?” said our new visitor, taking a step\\r\\nforward and shaking his hunting-crop. “I know you, you scoundrel! I have\\r\\nheard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy friend smiled.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Holmes, the busybody!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHis smile broadened.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHolmes chuckled heartily. “Your conversation is most entertaining,”\\r\\nsaid he. “When you go out close the door, for there is a decided\\r\\ndraught.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will go when I have had my say. Don’t you dare to meddle with my\\r\\naffairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a dangerous\\r\\nman to fall foul of! See here.” He stepped swiftly forward, seized the\\r\\npoker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“See that you keep yourself out of my grip,” he snarled, and\\r\\nhurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He seems a very amiable person,” said Holmes, laughing. “I\\r\\nam not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my\\r\\ngrip was not much more feeble than his own.” As he spoke he picked up the\\r\\nsteel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official\\r\\ndetective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I\\r\\nonly trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in\\r\\nallowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we shall order breakfast,\\r\\nand afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors’ Commons, where I hope to get\\r\\nsome data which may help us in this matter.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was nearly one o’clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his\\r\\nexcursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes\\r\\nand figures.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have seen the will of the deceased wife,” said he. “To\\r\\ndetermine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices\\r\\nof the investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the\\r\\ntime of the wife’s death was little short of Â£ 1,100, is now, through the\\r\\nfall in agricultural prices, not more than Â£ 750. Each daughter can claim an\\r\\nincome of Â£ 250, in case of marriage. It is evident, therefore, that if both\\r\\ngirls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one\\r\\nof them would cripple him to a very serious extent. My morning’s work has\\r\\nnot been wasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for\\r\\nstanding in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too\\r\\nserious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are\\r\\ninteresting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab\\r\\nand drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your\\r\\nrevolver into your pocket. An Eley’s No. 2 is an excellent argument with\\r\\ngentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush are, I\\r\\nthink, all that we need.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead, where we\\r\\nhired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the\\r\\nlovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy\\r\\nclouds in the heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out\\r\\ntheir first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the\\r\\nmoist earth. To me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet\\r\\npromise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My\\r\\ncompanion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down\\r\\nover his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest\\r\\nthought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed\\r\\nover the meadows.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Look there!” said he.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove\\r\\nat the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables\\r\\nand high roof-tree of a very old mansion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Stoke Moran?” said he.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,” remarked the\\r\\ndriver.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There is some building going on there,” said Holmes; “that\\r\\nis where we are going.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There’s the village,” said the driver, pointing to a cluster\\r\\nof roofs some distance to the left; “but if you want to get to the house,\\r\\nyou’ll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the footpath\\r\\nover the fields. There it is, where the lady is walking.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,” observed Holmes, shading\\r\\nhis eyes. “Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I thought it as well,” said Holmes as we climbed the stile,\\r\\n“that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some\\r\\ndefinite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see\\r\\nthat we have been as good as our word.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOur client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which\\r\\nspoke her joy. “I have been waiting so eagerly for you,” she cried,\\r\\nshaking hands with us warmly. “All has turned out splendidly. Dr. Roylott\\r\\nhas gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before\\r\\nevening.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We have had the pleasure of making the Doctor’s\\r\\nacquaintance,” said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had\\r\\noccurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens!” she cried, “he has followed me, then.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“So it appears.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will he\\r\\nsay when he returns?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more\\r\\ncunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him\\r\\nto-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt’s at\\r\\nHarrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once\\r\\nto the rooms which we are to examine.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion\\r\\nand two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. In\\r\\none of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards,\\r\\nwhile the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was\\r\\nin little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and\\r\\nthe blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys,\\r\\nshowed that this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been\\r\\nerected against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but\\r\\nthere were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked\\r\\nslowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the\\r\\noutsides of the windows.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the\\r\\ncentre one to your sister’s, and the one next to the main building to Dr.\\r\\nRoylott’s chamber?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not\\r\\nseem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my\\r\\nroom.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs\\r\\nthe corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows in it, of\\r\\ncourse?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable\\r\\nfrom that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar\\r\\nyour shutters?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMiss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the open\\r\\nwindow, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but without\\r\\nsuccess. There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the\\r\\nbar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron,\\r\\nbuilt firmly into the massive masonry. “Hum!” said he, scratching\\r\\nhis chin in some perplexity, “my theory certainly presents some\\r\\ndifficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted. Well, we\\r\\nshall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three\\r\\nbedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at\\r\\nonce to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in which\\r\\nher sister had met with her fate. It was a homely little room, with a low\\r\\nceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A\\r\\nbrown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in\\r\\nanother, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These\\r\\narticles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the\\r\\nroom save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and the\\r\\npanelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured\\r\\nthat it may have dated from the original building of the house. Holmes drew one\\r\\nof the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and\\r\\nround and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Where does that bell communicate with?” he asked at last pointing\\r\\nto a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying\\r\\nupon the pillow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It goes to the housekeeper’s room.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It looks newer than the other things?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your sister asked for it, I suppose?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we wanted\\r\\nfor ourselves.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You will\\r\\nexcuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor.” He\\r\\nthrew himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly\\r\\nbackward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he\\r\\ndid the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he\\r\\nwalked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his\\r\\neye up and down the wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it\\r\\na brisk tug.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, it’s a dummy,” said he.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Won’t it ring?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can\\r\\nsee now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for\\r\\nthe ventilator is.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How very absurd! I never noticed that before.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very strange!” muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. “There\\r\\nare one or two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a\\r\\nbuilder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same\\r\\ntrouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is also quite modern,” said the lady.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Done about the same time as the bell-rope?” remarked Holmes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that\\r\\ntime.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They seem to have been of a most interesting character—dummy\\r\\nbell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your permission, Miss\\r\\nStoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDr. Grimesby Roylott’s chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter,\\r\\nbut was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full of books,\\r\\nmostly of a technical character, an armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden\\r\\nchair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the principal\\r\\nthings which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all\\r\\nof them with the keenest interest.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What’s in here?” he asked, tapping the safe.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My stepfather’s business papers.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh! you have seen inside, then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There isn’t a cat in it, for example?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No. What a strange idea!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, look at this!” He took up a small saucer of milk which stood\\r\\non the top of it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No; we don’t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a\\r\\nbaboon.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer\\r\\nof milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay. There is one\\r\\npoint which I should wish to determine.” He squatted down in front of the\\r\\nwooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thank you. That is quite settled,” said he, rising and putting his\\r\\nlens in his pocket. “Hullo! Here is something interesting!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of\\r\\nthe bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a\\r\\nloop of whipcord.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What do you make of that, Watson?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It’s a common enough lash. But I don’t know why it should be\\r\\ntied.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it’s a wicked world,\\r\\nand when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I think\\r\\nthat I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your permission we shall\\r\\nwalk out upon the lawn.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI had never seen my friend’s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was\\r\\nwhen we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked several\\r\\ntimes up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking to break in\\r\\nupon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is very essential, Miss Stoner,” said he, “that you\\r\\nshould absolutely follow my advice in every respect.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I shall most certainly do so.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend upon\\r\\nyour compliance.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I assure you that I am in your hands.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your\\r\\nroom.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBoth Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village\\r\\ninn over there?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, that is the Crown.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Certainly.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when\\r\\nyour stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the night, you\\r\\nmust open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a\\r\\nsignal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to\\r\\nwant into the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of\\r\\nthe repairs, you could manage there for one night.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes, easily.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The rest you will leave in our hands.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But what will you do?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the\\r\\ncause of this noise which has disturbed you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,”\\r\\nsaid Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion’s sleeve.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps I have.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then, for pity’s sake, tell me what was the cause of my\\r\\nsister’s death.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she\\r\\ndied from some sudden fright.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more\\r\\ntangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr. Roylott\\r\\nreturned and saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and be brave, for\\r\\nif you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon\\r\\ndrive away the dangers that threaten you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room\\r\\nat the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from our window we could\\r\\ncommand a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran\\r\\nManor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form\\r\\nlooming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some\\r\\nslight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar\\r\\nof the Doctor’s voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched\\r\\nfists at him. The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light\\r\\nspring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do you know, Watson,” said Holmes as we sat together in the\\r\\ngathering darkness, “I have really some scruples as to taking you\\r\\nto-night. There is a distinct element of danger.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Can I be of assistance?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your presence might be invaluable.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I shall certainly come.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is very kind of you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than\\r\\nwas visible to me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that\\r\\nyou saw all that I did.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that could\\r\\nanswer I confess is more than I can imagine.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You saw the ventilator, too?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a\\r\\nsmall opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could hardly pass\\r\\nthrough.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke\\r\\nMoran.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear Holmes!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister\\r\\ncould smell Dr. Roylott’s cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once\\r\\nthat there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only be a\\r\\nsmall one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner’s inquiry.\\r\\nI deduced a ventilator.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But what harm can there be in that?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator is\\r\\nmade, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does not that\\r\\nstrike you?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I cannot as yet see any connection.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that\\r\\nbefore?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I cannot say that I have.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same relative\\r\\nposition to the ventilator and to the rope—or so we may call it, since it\\r\\nwas clearly never meant for a bell-pull.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Holmes,” I cried, “I seem to see dimly what you are hinting\\r\\nat. We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is the\\r\\nfirst of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and Pritchard\\r\\nwere among the heads of their profession. This man strikes even deeper, but I\\r\\nthink, Watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have\\r\\nhorrors enough before the night is over; for goodness’ sake let us have a\\r\\nquiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more\\r\\ncheerful.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAbout nine o’clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all\\r\\nwas dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly away, and\\r\\nthen, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone out\\r\\nright in front of us.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is our signal,” said Holmes, springing to his feet; “it\\r\\ncomes from the middle window.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we\\r\\nwere going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that we\\r\\nmight spend the night there. A moment later we were out on the dark road, a\\r\\nchill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us\\r\\nthrough the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches\\r\\ngaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we reached the\\r\\nlawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out from a\\r\\nclump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted\\r\\nchild, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly\\r\\nacross the lawn into the darkness.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My God!” I whispered; “did you see it?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHolmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice upon my\\r\\nwrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my\\r\\near.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is a nice household,” he murmured. “That is the\\r\\nbaboon.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI had forgotten the strange pets which the Doctor affected. There was a\\r\\ncheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment. I\\r\\nconfess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes’\\r\\nexample and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom. My\\r\\ncompanion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and\\r\\ncast his eyes round the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then\\r\\ncreeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear\\r\\nagain so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The least sound would be fatal to our plans.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI nodded to show that I had heard.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We must sit without light. He would see it through the\\r\\nventilator.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI nodded again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol\\r\\nready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in\\r\\nthat chair.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHolmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed beside\\r\\nhim. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle. Then he turned\\r\\ndown the lamp, and we were left in darkness.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHow shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not even\\r\\nthe drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within\\r\\na few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself.\\r\\nThe shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute\\r\\ndarkness.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFrom outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very\\r\\nwindow a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at\\r\\nliberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, which\\r\\nboomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters!\\r\\nTwelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for\\r\\nwhatever might befall.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSuddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the\\r\\nventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of\\r\\nburning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern.\\r\\nI heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though\\r\\nthe smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears. Then\\r\\nsuddenly another sound became audible—a very gentle, soothing sound, like\\r\\nthat of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant\\r\\nthat we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed\\r\\nfuriously with his cane at the bell-pull.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You see it, Watson?” he yelled. “You see it?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low,\\r\\nclear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it\\r\\nimpossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely. I\\r\\ncould, however, see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and\\r\\nloathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when\\r\\nsuddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to\\r\\nwhich I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of\\r\\npain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that\\r\\naway down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised\\r\\nthe sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazing\\r\\nat Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died away into the\\r\\nsilence from which it rose.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What can it mean?” I gasped.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It means that it is all over,” Holmes answered. “And\\r\\nperhaps, after all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr.\\r\\nRoylott’s room.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor. Twice he\\r\\nstruck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then he turned the\\r\\nhandle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a dark-lantern\\r\\nwith the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron\\r\\nsafe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat\\r\\nDr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles\\r\\nprotruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers.\\r\\nAcross his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed\\r\\nduring the day. His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a\\r\\ndreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a\\r\\npeculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly\\r\\nround his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The band! the speckled band!” whispered Holmes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and\\r\\nthere reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and\\r\\npuffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is a swamp adder!” cried Holmes; “the deadliest snake in\\r\\nIndia. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth,\\r\\nrecoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for\\r\\nanother. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove\\r\\nMiss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has\\r\\nhappened.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man’s lap, and\\r\\nthrowing the noose round the reptile’s neck he drew it from its horrid\\r\\nperch and, carrying it at arm’s length, threw it into the iron safe,\\r\\nwhich he closed upon it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSuch are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.\\r\\nIt is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to\\r\\ntoo great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl,\\r\\nhow we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at\\r\\nHarrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that\\r\\nthe doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The\\r\\nlittle which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as\\r\\nwe travelled back next day.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I had,” said he, “come to an entirely erroneous conclusion\\r\\nwhich shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from\\r\\ninsufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word\\r\\n‘band,’ which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the\\r\\nappearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match,\\r\\nwere sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the\\r\\nmerit that I instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear\\r\\nto me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come\\r\\neither from the window or the door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have\\r\\nalready remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung\\r\\ndown to the bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was\\r\\nclamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was\\r\\nthere as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed.\\r\\nThe idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my\\r\\nknowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India,\\r\\nI felt that I was probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of\\r\\npoison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just\\r\\nsuch a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern\\r\\ntraining. The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also,\\r\\nfrom his point of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner,\\r\\nindeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show\\r\\nwhere the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of\\r\\ncourse he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the\\r\\nvictim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to\\r\\nreturn to him when summoned. He would put it through this ventilator at the\\r\\nhour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope\\r\\nand land on the bed. It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might\\r\\nescape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An\\r\\ninspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on\\r\\nit, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the\\r\\nventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord\\r\\nwere enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic\\r\\nclang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily\\r\\nclosing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my\\r\\nmind, you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof.\\r\\nI heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly\\r\\nlit the light and attacked it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“With the result of driving it through the ventilator.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the\\r\\nother side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish\\r\\ntemper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this way I am no doubt\\r\\nindirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s death, and I cannot say\\r\\nthat it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience.”\\r\\n'], 'metadata': {'author': ['Arthur Conan Doyle', 'Arthur Conan Doyle'], 'year': tensor([1891, 1891]), 'url': ['https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1661/1661-h/1661-h.htm', 'https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1661/1661-h/1661-h.htm'], 'name': ['engineers_thumb', 'speckled_band']}}\n",

Some,\\r\\nhowever, have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have not\\r\\noffered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so\\r\\nhigh a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some,\\r\\ntoo, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings\\r\\nwithout an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and have\\r\\ntheir explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that\\r\\nabsolute logical proof which was so dear to him. There is, however, one of\\r\\nthese last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its\\r\\nresults that I am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that\\r\\nthere are points in connection with it which never have been, and probably\\r\\nnever will be, entirely cleared up.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe year ’87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less\\r\\ninterest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under this one\\r\\ntwelve months I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the\\r\\nAmateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a\\r\\nfurniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the British barque\\r\\nSophy Anderson, of the singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the\\r\\nisland of Uffa, and finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as\\r\\nmay be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man’s\\r\\nwatch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that therefore\\r\\nthe deceased had gone to bed within that time—a deduction which was of\\r\\nthe greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these I may sketch out at\\r\\nsome future date, but none of them present such singular features as the\\r\\nstrange train of circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had set in\\r\\nwith exceptional violence. All day the wind had screamed and the rain had\\r\\nbeaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of great, hand-made\\r\\nLondon we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of\\r\\nlife and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek\\r\\nat mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage.\\r\\nAs evening drew in, the storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and\\r\\nsobbed like a child in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of\\r\\nthe fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was\\r\\ndeep in one of Clark Russell’s fine sea-stories until the howl of the\\r\\ngale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the rain to\\r\\nlengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My wife was on a visit to\\r\\nher mother’s, and for a few days I was a dweller once more in my old\\r\\nquarters at Baker Street.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why,” said I, glancing up at my companion, “that was surely\\r\\nthe bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Except yourself I have none,” he answered. “I do not\\r\\nencourage visitors.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A client, then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on such\\r\\na day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to be some\\r\\ncrony of the landlady’s.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a step in\\r\\nthe passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his long arm to turn\\r\\nthe lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer\\r\\nmust sit.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Come in!” said he.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside, well-groomed\\r\\nand trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing. The\\r\\nstreaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof\\r\\ntold of the fierce weather through which he had come. He looked about him\\r\\nanxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his face was pale and\\r\\nhis eyes heavy, like those of a man who is weighed down with some great\\r\\nanxiety.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I owe you an apology,” he said, raising his golden pince-nez to\\r\\nhis eyes. “I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought\\r\\nsome traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Give me your coat and umbrella,” said Holmes. “They may rest\\r\\nhere on the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from the\\r\\nsouth-west, I see.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, from Horsham.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite\\r\\ndistinctive.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have come for advice.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is easily got.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And help.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is not always so easy.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how you\\r\\nsaved him in the Tankerville Club scandal.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He said that you could solve anything.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He said too much.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That you are never beaten.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have been beaten four times—three times by men, and once by a\\r\\nwoman.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But what is that compared with the number of your successes?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is true that I have been generally successful.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then you may be so with me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with\\r\\nsome details as to your case.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is no ordinary one.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of\\r\\nappeal.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have ever\\r\\nlistened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which\\r\\nhave happened in my own family.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You fill me with interest,” said Holmes. “Pray give us the\\r\\nessential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to\\r\\nthose details which seem to me to be most important.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the\\r\\nblaze.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My name,” said he, “is John Openshaw, but my own affairs\\r\\nhave, as far as I can understand, little to do with this awful business. It is\\r\\na hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must go\\r\\nback to the commencement of the affair.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You must know that my grandfather had two sons—my uncle Elias and\\r\\nmy father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which he enlarged\\r\\nat the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee of the Openshaw\\r\\nunbreakable tire, and his business met with such success that he was able to\\r\\nsell it and to retire upon a handsome competence.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became a\\r\\nplanter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well. At the time\\r\\nof the war he fought in Jackson’s army, and afterwards under Hood, where\\r\\nhe rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his\\r\\nplantation, where he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he\\r\\ncame back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had\\r\\nmade a very considerable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving them\\r\\nwas his aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in\\r\\nextending the franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and\\r\\nquick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring\\r\\ndisposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if ever he\\r\\nset foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three fields round his house,\\r\\nand there he would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he\\r\\nwould never leave his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very\\r\\nheavily, but he would see no society and did not want any friends, not even his\\r\\nown brother.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He didn’t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time\\r\\nwhen he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be in the\\r\\nyear 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He begged my\\r\\nfather to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way. When he\\r\\nwas sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he\\r\\nwould make me his representative both with the servants and with the\\r\\ntradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the\\r\\nhouse. I kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do what I liked, so\\r\\nlong as I did not disturb him in his privacy. There was one singular exception,\\r\\nhowever, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was\\r\\ninvariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to\\r\\nenter. With a boy’s curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I\\r\\nwas never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as\\r\\nwould be expected in such a room.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“One day—it was in March, 1883—a letter with a foreign stamp\\r\\nlay upon the table in front of the colonel’s plate. It was not a common\\r\\nthing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money,\\r\\nand he had no friends of any sort. ‘From India!’ said he as he took\\r\\nit up, ‘Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?’ Opening it\\r\\nhurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down\\r\\nupon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips\\r\\nat the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his\\r\\nskin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held in\\r\\nhis trembling hand, ‘K. K. K.!’ he shrieked, and then, ‘My\\r\\nGod, my God, my sins have overtaken me!’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘What is it, uncle?’ I cried.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Death,’ said he, and rising from the table he retired\\r\\nto his room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and saw\\r\\nscrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter K three\\r\\ntimes repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried pips. What could be\\r\\nthe reason of his overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I\\r\\nascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must have\\r\\nbelonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in\\r\\nthe other.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘They may do what they like, but I’ll checkmate them\\r\\nstill,’ said he with an oath. ‘Tell Mary that I shall want a fire\\r\\nin my room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step up\\r\\nto the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there was a mass\\r\\nof black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass box stood open and\\r\\nempty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the\\r\\nlid was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I wish you, John,’ said my uncle, ‘to witness\\r\\nmy will. I leave my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages,\\r\\nto my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you\\r\\ncan enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my advice,\\r\\nmy boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to give you such a\\r\\ntwo-edged thing, but I can’t say what turn things are going to take.\\r\\nKindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him.\\r\\nThe singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon me,\\r\\nand I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to\\r\\nmake anything of it. Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which\\r\\nit left behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and\\r\\nnothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I could see a\\r\\nchange in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined\\r\\nfor any sort of society. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the\\r\\ndoor locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken\\r\\nfrenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a\\r\\nrevolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man, and that he\\r\\nwas not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil. When these hot\\r\\nfits were over, however, he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and\\r\\nbar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the\\r\\nterror which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face,\\r\\neven on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a\\r\\nbasin.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse your\\r\\npatience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from\\r\\nwhich he never came back. We found him, when we went to search for him, face\\r\\ndownward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden.\\r\\nThere was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep, so that\\r\\nthe jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of\\r\\n‘suicide.’ But I, who knew how he winced from the very thought of\\r\\ndeath, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet\\r\\nit. The matter passed, however, and my father entered into possession of the\\r\\nestate, and of some Â£ 14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“One moment,” Holmes interposed, “your statement is, I\\r\\nforesee, one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have\\r\\nthe date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his\\r\\nsupposed suicide.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later,\\r\\nupon the night of May 2nd.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thank you. Pray proceed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made a\\r\\ncareful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We found the\\r\\nbrass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On the inside of the\\r\\ncover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and\\r\\n‘Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register’ written beneath.\\r\\nThese, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed\\r\\nby Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was nothing of much importance in the\\r\\nattic save a great many scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my\\r\\nuncle’s life in America. Some of them were of the war time and showed\\r\\nthat he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier.\\r\\nOthers were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern states, and\\r\\nwere mostly concerned with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part\\r\\nin opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the North.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, it was the beginning of ’84 when my father came to live at\\r\\nHorsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the January of\\r\\n’85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp\\r\\ncry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There he was,\\r\\nsitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in\\r\\nthe outstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what he called\\r\\nmy cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked very scared and puzzled\\r\\nnow that the same thing had come upon himself.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Why, what on earth does this mean, John?’ he\\r\\nstammered.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My heart had turned to lead. ‘It is K. K. K.,’ said I.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He looked inside the envelope. ‘So it is,’ he cried.\\r\\n‘Here are the very letters. But what is this written above them?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Put the papers on the sundial,’ I read, peeping over\\r\\nhis shoulder.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘What papers? What sundial?’ he asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘The sundial in the garden. There is no other,’ said\\r\\nI; ‘but the papers must be those that are destroyed.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Pooh!’ said he, gripping hard at his courage.\\r\\n‘We are in a civilised land here, and we can’t have tomfoolery of\\r\\nthis kind. Where does the thing come from?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘From Dundee,’ I answered, glancing at the postmark.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Some preposterous practical joke,’ said he.\\r\\n‘What have I to do with sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of\\r\\nsuch nonsense.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I should certainly speak to the police,’ I said.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Then let me do so?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘No, I forbid you. I won’t have a fuss made about such\\r\\nnonsense.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I\\r\\nwent about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home\\r\\nto visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command of one of the\\r\\nforts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go, for it seemed to me\\r\\nthat he was farther from danger when he was away from home. In that, however, I\\r\\nwas in error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram from the\\r\\nmajor, imploring me to come at once. My father had fallen over one of the deep\\r\\nchalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a\\r\\nshattered skull. I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever\\r\\nrecovered his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham\\r\\nin the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit\\r\\nunfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of ‘death\\r\\nfrom accidental causes.’ Carefully as I examined every fact connected\\r\\nwith his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of\\r\\nmurder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no record of\\r\\nstrangers having been seen upon the roads. And yet I need not tell you that my\\r\\nmind was far from at ease, and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot\\r\\nhad been woven round him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I\\r\\ndid not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our troubles\\r\\nwere in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle’s life, and that\\r\\nthe danger would be as pressing in one house as in another.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was in January, ’85, that my poor father met his end, and two\\r\\nyears and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time I have lived\\r\\nhappily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed away\\r\\nfrom the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. I had begun to\\r\\ntake comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very\\r\\nshape in which it had come upon my father.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning to the\\r\\ntable he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This is the envelope,” he continued. “The postmark is\\r\\nLondon—eastern division. Within are the very words which were upon my\\r\\nfather’s last message: ‘K. K. K.’; and then ‘Put the\\r\\npapers on the sundial.’”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What have you done?” asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nothing.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nothing?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“To tell the truth”—he sank his face into his thin, white\\r\\nhands—“I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor\\r\\nrabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of\\r\\nsome resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can\\r\\nguard against.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Tut! tut!” cried Sherlock Holmes. “You must act, man, or you\\r\\nare lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have seen the police.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the\\r\\ninspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes, and\\r\\nthat the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as the jury stated, and\\r\\nwere not to be connected with the warnings.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHolmes shook his clenched hands in the air. “Incredible\\r\\nimbecility!” he cried.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the house\\r\\nwith me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Has he come with you to-night?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No. His orders were to stay in the house.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAgain Holmes raved in the air.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why did you come to me?” he said, “and, above all, why did\\r\\nyou not come at once?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast\\r\\nabout my troubles and was advised by him to come to you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted\\r\\nbefore this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which you have\\r\\nplaced before us—no suggestive detail which might help us?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There is one thing,” said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat\\r\\npocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it\\r\\nout upon the table. “I have some remembrance,” said he, “that\\r\\non the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small, unburned\\r\\nmargins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour. I found this\\r\\nsingle sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it may\\r\\nbe one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others,\\r\\nand in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not\\r\\nsee that it helps us much. I think myself that it is a page from some private\\r\\ndiary. The writing is undoubtedly my uncle’s.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHolmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which showed\\r\\nby its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It was headed,\\r\\n“March, 1869,” and beneath were the following enigmatical notices:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and John Swain of St.\\r\\nAugustine.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“9th. McCauley cleared.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“10th. John Swain cleared.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“12th. Visited Paramore. All well.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thank you!” said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to\\r\\nour visitor. “And now you must on no account lose another instant. We\\r\\ncannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get home\\r\\ninstantly and act.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What shall I do?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put this\\r\\npiece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have\\r\\ndescribed. You must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were\\r\\nburned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which remains. You must\\r\\nassert that in such words as will carry conviction with them. Having done this,\\r\\nyou must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do you\\r\\nunderstand?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Entirely.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think\\r\\nthat we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to weave, while\\r\\ntheirs is already woven. The first consideration is to remove the pressing\\r\\ndanger which threatens you. The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish\\r\\nthe guilty parties.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I thank you,” said the young man, rising and pulling on his\\r\\novercoat. “You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as\\r\\nyou advise.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the\\r\\nmeanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened\\r\\nby a very real and imminent danger. How do you go back?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“By train from Waterloo.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you may\\r\\nbe in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am armed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I shall see you at Horsham, then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to the\\r\\nbox and the papers. I shall take your advice in every particular.” He\\r\\nshook hands with us and took his leave. Outside the wind still screamed and the\\r\\nrain splashed and pattered against the windows. This strange, wild story seemed\\r\\nto have come to us from amid the mad elements—blown in upon us like a\\r\\nsheet of sea-weed in a gale—and now to have been reabsorbed by them once\\r\\nmore.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk forward and\\r\\nhis eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit his pipe, and leaning\\r\\nback in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up\\r\\nto the ceiling.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I think, Watson,” he remarked at last, “that of all our\\r\\ncases we have had none more fantastic than this.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to me\\r\\nto be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But have you,” I asked, “formed any definite conception as\\r\\nto what these perils are?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There can be no question as to their nature,” he answered.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this\\r\\nunhappy family?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his\\r\\nchair, with his finger-tips together. “The ideal reasoner,” he\\r\\nremarked, “would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its\\r\\nbearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it\\r\\nbut also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly\\r\\ndescribe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer\\r\\nwho has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able\\r\\nto accurately state all the other ones, both before and after. We have not yet\\r\\ngrasped the results which the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be\\r\\nsolved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by\\r\\nthe aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is\\r\\nnecessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have\\r\\ncome to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a\\r\\npossession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and\\r\\nencyclopÃ¦dias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so impossible,\\r\\nhowever, that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful\\r\\nto him in his work, and this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember\\r\\nrightly, you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my\\r\\nlimits in a very precise fashion.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” I answered, laughing. “It was a singular document.\\r\\nPhilosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany\\r\\nvariable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region within\\r\\nfifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational\\r\\nliterature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer,\\r\\nand self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the main points\\r\\nof my analysis.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHolmes grinned at the last item. “Well,” he said, “I say now,\\r\\nas I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all\\r\\nthe furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the\\r\\nlumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a\\r\\ncase as the one which has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to\\r\\nmuster all our resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the American\\r\\nEncyclopÃ¦dia which stands upon the shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us\\r\\nconsider the situation and see what may be deduced from it. In the first place,\\r\\nwe may start with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very\\r\\nstrong reason for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all\\r\\ntheir habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the\\r\\nlonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of solitude in\\r\\nEngland suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something, so we\\r\\nmay assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something\\r\\nwhich drove him from America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce\\r\\nthat by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and\\r\\nhis successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third\\r\\nfrom London.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“From East London. What do you deduce from that?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that the\\r\\nprobability—the strong probability—is that the writer was on board\\r\\nof a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of Pondicherry,\\r\\nseven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment, in Dundee it was\\r\\nonly some three or four days. Does that suggest anything?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A greater distance to travel.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But the letter had also a greater distance to come.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I do not see the point.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men\\r\\nare is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send their singular warning\\r\\nor token before them when starting upon their mission. You see how quickly the\\r\\ndeed followed the sign when it came from Dundee. If they had come from\\r\\nPondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their\\r\\nletter. But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those seven\\r\\nweeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter\\r\\nand the sailing vessel which brought the writer.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is possible.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of\\r\\nthis new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has always\\r\\nfallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the\\r\\ndistance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon\\r\\ndelay.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good God!” I cried. “What can it mean, this relentless\\r\\npersecution?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to\\r\\nthe person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite clear that\\r\\nthere must be more than one of them. A single man could not have carried out\\r\\ntwo deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner’s jury. There must have\\r\\nbeen several in it, and they must have been men of resource and determination.\\r\\nTheir papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may. In this way\\r\\nyou see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the\\r\\nbadge of a society.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But of what society?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Have you never—” said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and\\r\\nsinking his voice—“have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I never have.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHolmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. “Here it\\r\\nis,” said he presently:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance\\r\\nto the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was\\r\\nformed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil\\r\\nWar, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country,\\r\\nnotably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power\\r\\nwas used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the negro\\r\\nvoters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed\\r\\nto its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the\\r\\nmarked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape—a sprig of\\r\\noak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving\\r\\nthis the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from\\r\\nthe country. If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon\\r\\nhim, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was the\\r\\norganisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that there is\\r\\nhardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity,\\r\\nor in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. For some\\r\\nyears the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States\\r\\ngovernment and of the better classes of the community in the South. Eventually,\\r\\nin the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have\\r\\nbeen sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You will observe,” said Holmes, laying down the volume,\\r\\n“that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the\\r\\ndisappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been\\r\\ncause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more\\r\\nimplacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this register and\\r\\ndiary may implicate some of the first men in the South, and that there may be\\r\\nmany who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then the page we have seen—”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, ‘sent the\\r\\npips to A, B, and C’—that is, sent the society’s warning to\\r\\nthem. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the\\r\\ncountry, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C.\\r\\nWell, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place, and I\\r\\nbelieve that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I\\r\\nhave told him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand\\r\\nme over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable\\r\\nweather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued\\r\\nbrightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city. Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes was already at breakfast when I came down.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You will excuse me for not waiting for you,” said he; “I\\r\\nhave, I foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young\\r\\nOpenshaw’s.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What steps will you take?” I asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may\\r\\nhave to go down to Horsham, after all.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You will not go there first?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the maid will\\r\\nbring up your coffee.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye\\r\\nover it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Holmes,” I cried, “you are too late.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah!” said he, laying down his cup, “I feared as much. How\\r\\nwas it done?” He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading ‘Tragedy Near\\r\\nWaterloo Bridge.’ Here is the account:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of\\r\\nthe H Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a splash\\r\\nin the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in\\r\\nspite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a\\r\\nrescue. The alarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the\\r\\nbody was eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman whose\\r\\nname, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was John\\r\\nOpenshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham. It is conjectured that he may\\r\\nhave been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that\\r\\nin his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the\\r\\nedge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. The body\\r\\nexhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased\\r\\nhad been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of\\r\\ncalling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside\\r\\nlanding-stages.’”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken than I had\\r\\never seen him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That hurts my pride, Watson,” he said at last. “It is a\\r\\npetty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter\\r\\nwith me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang.\\r\\nThat he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to his\\r\\ndeath—!” He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in\\r\\nuncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous\\r\\nclasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They must be cunning devils,” he exclaimed at last. “How\\r\\ncould they have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct\\r\\nline to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a\\r\\nnight, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in the long\\r\\nrun. I am going out now!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“To the police?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take the\\r\\nflies, but not before.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAll day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the evening\\r\\nbefore I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come back yet. It\\r\\nwas nearly ten o’clock before he entered, looking pale and worn. He\\r\\nwalked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it\\r\\nvoraciously, washing it down with a long draught of water.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are hungry,” I remarked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since\\r\\nbreakfast.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nothing?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not a bite. I had no time to think of it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And how have you succeeded?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You have a clue?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long\\r\\nremain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon\\r\\nthem. It is well thought of!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out\\r\\nthe pips upon the table. Of these he took five and thrust them into an\\r\\nenvelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote “S. H. for J. O.” Then\\r\\nhe sealed it and addressed it to “Captain James Calhoun, Barque Lone\\r\\nStar, Savannah, Georgia.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That will await him when he enters port,” said he, chuckling.\\r\\n“It may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor\\r\\nof his fate as Openshaw did before him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And who is this Captain Calhoun?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How did you trace it, then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates and\\r\\nnames.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have spent the whole day,” said he, “over Lloyd’s\\r\\nregisters and files of the old papers, following the future career of every\\r\\nvessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in ’83. There\\r\\nwere thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those\\r\\nmonths. Of these, one, the Lone Star, instantly attracted my attention,\\r\\nsince, although it was reported as having cleared from London, the name is that\\r\\nwhich is given to one of the states of the Union.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Texas, I think.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an\\r\\nAmerican origin.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque Lone\\r\\nStar was there in January, ’85, my suspicion became a certainty. I\\r\\nthen inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of\\r\\nLondon.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The Lone Star had arrived here last week. I went down to the\\r\\nAlbert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide\\r\\nthis morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and learned that\\r\\nshe had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly I have no doubt that\\r\\nshe is now past the Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What will you do, then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the\\r\\nonly native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and Germans. I\\r\\nknow, also, that they were all three away from the ship last night. I had it\\r\\nfrom the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By the time that their\\r\\nsailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and\\r\\nthe cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these three gentlemen\\r\\nare badly wanted here upon a charge of murder.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the\\r\\nmurderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would\\r\\nshow them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves, was upon\\r\\ntheir track. Very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year. We\\r\\nwaited long for news of the Lone Star of Savannah, but none ever reached\\r\\nus. We did at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a shattered\\r\\nstern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave, with the\\r\\nletters “L. S.” carved upon it, and that is all which we shall ever\\r\\nknow of the fate of the Lone Star.\\r\\n', '\\nTo Sherlock Holmes she\\r\\nis always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other\\r\\nname. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was\\r\\nnot that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and\\r\\nthat one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably\\r\\nbalanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing\\r\\nmachine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in\\r\\na false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a\\r\\nsneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for drawing\\r\\nthe veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to\\r\\nadmit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was\\r\\nto introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental\\r\\nresults. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own\\r\\nhigh-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a\\r\\nnature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was\\r\\nthe late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each\\r\\nother. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up\\r\\naround the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were\\r\\nsufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of\\r\\nsociety with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street,\\r\\nburied among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine\\r\\nand ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen\\r\\nnature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and\\r\\noccupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in\\r\\nfollowing out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been\\r\\nabandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some\\r\\nvague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the\\r\\nTrepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson\\r\\nbrothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished\\r\\nso delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these\\r\\nsigns of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of\\r\\nthe daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOne night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning\\r\\nfrom a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my\\r\\nway led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which\\r\\nmust always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark\\r\\nincidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see\\r\\nHolmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His\\r\\nrooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare\\r\\nfigure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the\\r\\nroom swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped\\r\\nbehind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner\\r\\ntold their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his\\r\\ndrug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the\\r\\nbell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHis manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see\\r\\nme. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an\\r\\narmchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a\\r\\ngasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his\\r\\nsingular introspective fashion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Watson, that you\\r\\nhave put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Seven!” I answered.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I\\r\\nfancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you\\r\\nintended to go into harness.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then, how do you know?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself\\r\\nvery wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant\\r\\ngirl?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would\\r\\ncertainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that\\r\\nI had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I\\r\\nhave changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary\\r\\nJane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again,\\r\\nI fail to see how you work it out.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on\\r\\nthe inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather\\r\\nis scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by\\r\\nsomeone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to\\r\\nremove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had\\r\\nbeen out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant\\r\\nboot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a\\r\\ngentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of\\r\\nnitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of\\r\\nhis top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull,\\r\\nindeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical\\r\\nprofession.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of\\r\\ndeduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked,\\r\\n“the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could\\r\\neasily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am\\r\\nbaffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as\\r\\ngood as yours.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\\r\\ndown into an armchair. “You see, but you do not observe. The distinction\\r\\nis clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from\\r\\nthe hall to this room.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Frequently.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How often?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, some hundreds of times.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then how many are there?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How many? I don’t know.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my\\r\\npoint. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and\\r\\nobserved. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and\\r\\nsince you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences,\\r\\nyou may be interested in this.” He threw over a sheet of thick,\\r\\npink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table. “It came\\r\\nby the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight\\r\\no’clock,” it said, “a gentleman who desires to consult you\\r\\nupon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the\\r\\nroyal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted\\r\\nwith matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This\\r\\naccount of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at\\r\\nthat hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imagine\\r\\nthat it means?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has\\r\\ndata. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of\\r\\ntheories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked,\\r\\nendeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes. “Such paper could\\r\\nnot be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and\\r\\nstiff.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It is\\r\\nnot an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI did so, and saw a large “E” with a small “g,” a\\r\\n“P,” and a large “G” with a small “t” woven\\r\\ninto the texture of the paper.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What do you make of that?” asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not at all. The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands\\r\\nfor ‘Gesellschaft,’ which is the German for ‘Company.’\\r\\nIt is a customary contraction like our ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ of\\r\\ncourse, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us\\r\\nglance at our Continental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy brown volume\\r\\nfrom his shelves. “Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a\\r\\nGerman-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad.\\r\\n‘Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its\\r\\nnumerous glass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you\\r\\nmake of that?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant\\r\\ncloud from his cigarette.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the\\r\\npeculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we have\\r\\nfrom all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have\\r\\nwritten that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only\\r\\nremains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon\\r\\nBohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he\\r\\ncomes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating wheels\\r\\nagainst the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A pair, by the sound,” said he. “Yes,” he continued,\\r\\nglancing out of the window. “A nice little brougham and a pair of\\r\\nbeauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There’s money in this case,\\r\\nWatson, if there is nothing else.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I think that I had better go, Holmes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And\\r\\nthis promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But your client—”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit\\r\\ndown in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage,\\r\\npaused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative\\r\\ntap.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Come in!” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in\\r\\nheight, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a\\r\\nrichness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy\\r\\nbands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his\\r\\ndouble-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his\\r\\nshoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a\\r\\nbrooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway\\r\\nup his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur,\\r\\ncompleted the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole\\r\\nappearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across\\r\\nthe upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard\\r\\nmask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still\\r\\nraised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a\\r\\nman of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin\\r\\nsuggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You had my note?” he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly\\r\\nmarked German accent. “I told you that I would call.” He looked\\r\\nfrom one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Pray take a seat,” said Holmes. “This is my friend and\\r\\ncolleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases.\\r\\nWhom have I the honour to address?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I\\r\\nunderstand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion,\\r\\nwhom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should\\r\\nmuch prefer to communicate with you alone.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my\\r\\nchair. “It is both, or none,” said he. “You may say before\\r\\nthis gentleman anything which you may say to me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Count shrugged his broad shoulders. “Then I must begin,” said\\r\\nhe, “by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of\\r\\nthat time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to\\r\\nsay that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European\\r\\nhistory.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I promise,” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor.\\r\\n“The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you,\\r\\nand I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is\\r\\nnot exactly my own.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was aware of it,” said Holmes dryly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be\\r\\ntaken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously\\r\\ncompromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter\\r\\nimplicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was also aware of that,” murmured Holmes, settling himself down\\r\\nin his armchair and closing his eyes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOur visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure\\r\\nof the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner\\r\\nand most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked\\r\\nimpatiently at his gigantic client.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,” he remarked,\\r\\n“I should be better able to advise you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable\\r\\nagitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face\\r\\nand hurled it upon the ground. “You are right,” he cried; “I\\r\\nam the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, indeed?” murmured Holmes. “Your Majesty had not spoken\\r\\nbefore I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von\\r\\nOrmstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But you can understand,” said our strange visitor, sitting down\\r\\nonce more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, “you can\\r\\nunderstand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person.\\r\\nYet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without\\r\\nputting myself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the\\r\\npurpose of consulting you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then, pray consult,” said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit\\r\\nto Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler.\\r\\nThe name is no doubt familiar to you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,” murmured Holmes without\\r\\nopening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all\\r\\nparagraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a\\r\\nsubject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this\\r\\ncase I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and\\r\\nthat of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Let me see!” said Holmes. “Hum! Born in New Jersey in the\\r\\nyear 1858. Contralto—hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of\\r\\nWarsaw—yes! Retired from operatic stage—ha! Living in\\r\\nLondon—quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with\\r\\nthis young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of\\r\\ngetting those letters back.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Precisely so. But how—”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Was there a secret marriage?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“None.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No legal papers or certificates?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“None.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce\\r\\nher letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their\\r\\nauthenticity?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There is the writing.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Pooh, pooh! Forgery.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My private note-paper.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Stolen.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My own seal.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Imitated.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My photograph.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Bought.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We were both in the photograph.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an\\r\\nindiscretion.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was mad—insane.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You have compromised yourself seriously.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It must be recovered.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We have tried and failed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“She will not sell.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Stolen, then.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her\\r\\nhouse. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been\\r\\nwaylaid. There has been no result.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No sign of it?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Absolutely none.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHolmes laughed. “It is quite a pretty little problem,” said he.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But a very serious one to me,” returned the King reproachfully.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the\\r\\nphotograph?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“To ruin me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But how?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am about to be married.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“So I have heard.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of\\r\\nScandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herself\\r\\nthe very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the\\r\\nmatter to an end.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And Irene Adler?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that\\r\\nshe will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the\\r\\nface of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men.\\r\\nRather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she\\r\\nwould not go—none.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are sure that she has not sent it yet?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am sure.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And why?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the\\r\\nbetrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, then we have three days yet,” said Holmes with a yawn.\\r\\n“That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to\\r\\nlook into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the\\r\\npresent?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count\\r\\nVon Kramm.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then, as to money?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You have carte blanche.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Absolutely?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have\\r\\nthat photograph.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And for present expenses?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on\\r\\nthe table.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in\\r\\nnotes,” he said.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHolmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And Mademoiselle’s address?” he asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John’s Wood.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHolmes took a note of it. “One other question,” said he. “Was\\r\\nthe photograph a cabinet?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some\\r\\ngood news for you. And good-night, Watson,” he added, as the wheels of\\r\\nthe royal brougham rolled down the street. “If you will be good enough to\\r\\ncall to-morrow afternoon at three o’clock I should like to chat this\\r\\nlittle matter over with you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt three o’clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet\\r\\nreturned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after\\r\\neight o’clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with\\r\\nthe intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply\\r\\ninterested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim\\r\\nand strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have\\r\\nalready recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his\\r\\nclient gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the\\r\\ninvestigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly\\r\\ngrasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a\\r\\npleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle\\r\\nmethods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed\\r\\nwas I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had\\r\\nceased to enter into my head.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom,\\r\\nill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes,\\r\\nwalked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my friend’s amazing powers\\r\\nin the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it\\r\\nwas indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in\\r\\nfive minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into\\r\\nhis pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed\\r\\nheartily for some minutes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, really!” he cried, and then he choked and laughed again\\r\\nuntil he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What is it?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It’s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I\\r\\nemployed my morning, or what I ended by doing.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I can’t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits,\\r\\nand perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I\\r\\nleft the house a little after eight o’clock this morning in the character\\r\\nof a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among\\r\\nhorsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon\\r\\nfound Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but\\r\\nbuilt out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door.\\r\\nLarge sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost\\r\\nto the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child\\r\\ncould open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window\\r\\ncould be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and\\r\\nexamined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else\\r\\nof interest.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was\\r\\na mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers\\r\\na hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass\\r\\nof half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could\\r\\ndesire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the\\r\\nneighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies\\r\\nI was compelled to listen to.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And what of Irene Adler?” I asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part. She is\\r\\nthe daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews,\\r\\nto a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day,\\r\\nand returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except\\r\\nwhen she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark,\\r\\nhandsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is\\r\\na Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a\\r\\nconfidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and\\r\\nknew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to\\r\\nwalk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of\\r\\ncampaign.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He\\r\\nwas a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between them, and\\r\\nwhat the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his\\r\\nmistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his\\r\\nkeeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question\\r\\ndepended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my\\r\\nattention to the gentleman’s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate\\r\\npoint, and it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with\\r\\nthese details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to\\r\\nunderstand the situation.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am following you closely,” I answered.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up\\r\\nto Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome man,\\r\\ndark, aquiline, and moustached—evidently the man of whom I had heard. He\\r\\nappeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed\\r\\npast the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at\\r\\nhome.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of\\r\\nhim in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly,\\r\\nand waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking\\r\\neven more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold\\r\\nwatch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, ‘Drive like the\\r\\ndevil,’ he shouted, ‘first to Gross & Hankey’s in Regent\\r\\nStreet, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a\\r\\nguinea if you do it in twenty minutes!’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to\\r\\nfollow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his\\r\\ncoat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his\\r\\nharness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn’t pulled up before she\\r\\nshot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the\\r\\nmoment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘The Church of St. Monica, John,’ she cried,\\r\\n‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I\\r\\nshould run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came\\r\\nthrough the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped\\r\\nin before he could object. ‘The Church of St. Monica,’ said I,\\r\\n‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.’ It was\\r\\ntwenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in\\r\\nthe wind.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My cabby drove fast. I don’t think I ever drove faster, but the\\r\\nothers were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses\\r\\nwere in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the\\r\\nchurch. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a\\r\\nsurpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all\\r\\nthree standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle\\r\\nlike any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise,\\r\\nthe three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as\\r\\nhard as he could towards me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Thank God,’ he cried. ‘You’ll do. Come!\\r\\nCome!’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘What then?’ I asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won’t be\\r\\nlegal.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I\\r\\nfound myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching\\r\\nfor things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying\\r\\nup of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an\\r\\ninstant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady\\r\\non the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most\\r\\npreposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the\\r\\nthought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been\\r\\nsome informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to\\r\\nmarry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved\\r\\nthe bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best\\r\\nman. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch chain in\\r\\nmemory of the occasion.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,” said I; “and\\r\\nwhat then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair\\r\\nmight take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic\\r\\nmeasures on my part. At the church door, however, they separated, he driving\\r\\nback to the Temple, and she to her own house. ‘I shall drive out in the\\r\\npark at five as usual,’ she said as she left him. I heard no more. They\\r\\ndrove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own\\r\\narrangements.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Which are?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Some cold beef and a glass of beer,” he answered, ringing the\\r\\nbell. “I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be\\r\\nbusier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your\\r\\nco-operation.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I shall be delighted.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You don’t mind breaking the law?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not in the least.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nor running a chance of arrest?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not in a good cause.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, the cause is excellent!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I am your man.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was sure that I might rely on you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But what is it you wish?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you.\\r\\nNow,” he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady\\r\\nhad provided, “I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time.\\r\\nIt is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss\\r\\nIrene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony\\r\\nLodge to meet her.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And what then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur.\\r\\nThere is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come\\r\\nwhat may. You understand?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am to be neutral?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small\\r\\nunpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into the\\r\\nhouse. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open. You\\r\\nare to station yourself close to that open window.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And when I raise my hand—so—you will throw into the room\\r\\nwhat I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire.\\r\\nYou quite follow me?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Entirely.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is nothing very formidable,” he said, taking a long\\r\\ncigar-shaped roll from his pocket. “It is an ordinary plumber’s\\r\\nsmoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your\\r\\ntask is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up\\r\\nby quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I\\r\\nwill rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the\\r\\nsignal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you\\r\\nat the corner of the street.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Precisely.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then you may entirely rely on me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare\\r\\nfor the new role I have to play.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character\\r\\nof an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His broad black hat,\\r\\nhis baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of\\r\\npeering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have\\r\\nequalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression,\\r\\nhis manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed.\\r\\nThe stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he\\r\\nbecame a specialist in crime.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten\\r\\nminutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was\\r\\nalready dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in\\r\\nfront of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was\\r\\njust such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes’ succinct\\r\\ndescription, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On\\r\\nthe contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably\\r\\nanimated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a\\r\\ncorner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with\\r\\na nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down\\r\\nwith cigars in their mouths.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You see,” remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the\\r\\nhouse, “this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a\\r\\ndouble-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its\\r\\nbeing seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of\\r\\nhis princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Where, indeed?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet\\r\\nsize. Too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows\\r\\nthat the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of\\r\\nthe sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry\\r\\nit about with her.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Where, then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am\\r\\ninclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do\\r\\ntheir own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could\\r\\ntrust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political\\r\\ninfluence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that\\r\\nshe had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her\\r\\nhands upon it. It must be in her own house.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But it has twice been burgled.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Pshaw! They did not know how to look.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But how will you look?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will not look.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will get her to show me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But she will refuse.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her\\r\\ncarriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of\\r\\nthe avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony\\r\\nLodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to\\r\\nopen the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another\\r\\nloafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out,\\r\\nwhich was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the\\r\\nloungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side.\\r\\nA blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her\\r\\ncarriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who\\r\\nstruck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into\\r\\nthe crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her, he gave a cry and\\r\\ndropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall\\r\\nthe guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the\\r\\nother, while a number of better dressed people, who had watched the scuffle\\r\\nwithout taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the\\r\\ninjured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps;\\r\\nbut she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of\\r\\nthe hall, looking back into the street.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Is the poor gentleman much hurt?” she asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He is dead,” cried several voices.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, no, there’s life in him!” shouted another. “But\\r\\nhe’ll be gone before you can get him to hospital.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He’s a brave fellow,” said a woman. “They would have\\r\\nhad the lady’s purse and watch if it hadn’t been for him. They were\\r\\na gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he’s breathing now.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He can’t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa.\\r\\nThis way, please!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSlowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the\\r\\nprincipal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the\\r\\nwindow. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I\\r\\ncould see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized\\r\\nwith compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I\\r\\nnever felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the\\r\\nbeautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness\\r\\nwith which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest\\r\\ntreachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to\\r\\nme. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After\\r\\nall, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from\\r\\ninjuring another.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHolmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in\\r\\nneed of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same\\r\\ninstant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the\\r\\nroom with a cry of “Fire!” The word was no sooner out of my mouth\\r\\nthan the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill—gentlemen,\\r\\nostlers, and servant maids—joined in a general shriek of\\r\\n“Fire!” Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at\\r\\nthe open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the\\r\\nvoice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping\\r\\nthrough the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in\\r\\nten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm in mine, and to get away\\r\\nfrom the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes\\r\\nuntil we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the\\r\\nEdgeware Road.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You did it very nicely, Doctor,” he remarked. “Nothing could\\r\\nhave been better. It is all right.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You have the photograph?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I know where it is.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And how did you find out?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“She showed me, as I told you she would.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am still in the dark.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laughing. “The\\r\\nmatter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street\\r\\nwas an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I guessed as much.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm\\r\\nof my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became\\r\\na piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That also I could fathom.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could\\r\\nshe do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected.\\r\\nIt lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which. They\\r\\nlaid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window,\\r\\nand you had your chance.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How did that help you?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her\\r\\ninstinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a\\r\\nperfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of\\r\\nit. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me, and\\r\\nalso in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an\\r\\nunmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady\\r\\nof to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in\\r\\nquest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done.\\r\\nThe smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded\\r\\nbeautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above\\r\\nthe right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it\\r\\nas she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she\\r\\nreplaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen\\r\\nher since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated\\r\\nwhether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come\\r\\nin, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. A little\\r\\nover-precipitance may ruin all.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And now?” I asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King to-morrow,\\r\\nand with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the\\r\\nsitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she\\r\\nmay find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his\\r\\nMajesty to regain it with his own hands.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And when will you call?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a\\r\\nclear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete\\r\\nchange in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without delay.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was searching his\\r\\npockets for the key when someone passing said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting\\r\\nappeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’ve heard that voice before,” said Holmes, staring down the\\r\\ndimly lit street. “Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have\\r\\nbeen.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and\\r\\ncoffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You have really got it!” he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by\\r\\neither shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not yet.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But you have hopes?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have hopes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We must have a cab.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, my brougham is waiting.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then that will simplify matters.” We descended and started off\\r\\nonce more for Briony Lodge.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Irene Adler is married,” remarked Holmes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Married! When?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yesterday.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But to whom?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“To an English lawyer named Norton.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But she could not love him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am in hopes that she does.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And why in hopes?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If the\\r\\nlady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does not love\\r\\nyour Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your\\r\\nMajesty’s plan.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is true. And yet—! Well! I wish she had been of my own station!\\r\\nWhat a queen she would have made!” He relapsed into a moody silence,\\r\\nwhich was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps.\\r\\nShe watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?” said she.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am Mr. Holmes,” answered my companion, looking at her with a\\r\\nquestioning and rather startled gaze.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left this\\r\\nmorning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for the\\r\\nContinent.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What!” Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and\\r\\nsurprise. “Do you mean that she has left England?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Never to return.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And the papers?” asked the King hoarsely. “All is\\r\\nlost.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We shall see.” He pushed past the servant and rushed into the\\r\\ndrawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was scattered\\r\\nabout in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the\\r\\nlady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at the\\r\\nbell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled\\r\\nout a photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in\\r\\nevening dress, the letter was superscribed to “Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To\\r\\nbe left till called for.” My friend tore it open, and we all three read\\r\\nit together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this\\r\\nway:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—You really did it very well. You took\\r\\nme in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion. But\\r\\nthen, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been\\r\\nwarned against you months ago. I had been told that, if the King employed an\\r\\nagent, it would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with\\r\\nall this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became\\r\\nsuspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman.\\r\\nBut, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is\\r\\nnothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent\\r\\nJohn, the coachman, to watch you, ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as\\r\\nI call them, and came down just as you departed.\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0“Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an\\r\\nobject of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather\\r\\nimprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my\\r\\nhusband.\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0“We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by\\r\\nso formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call\\r\\nto-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am\\r\\nloved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without hindrance\\r\\nfrom one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and\\r\\nto preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might\\r\\ntake in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I\\r\\nremain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very truly yours,\\r\\n“IRENE NORTON, nÃ©e ADLER.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What a woman—oh, what a woman!” cried the King of Bohemia,\\r\\nwhen we had all three read this epistle. “Did I not tell you how quick\\r\\nand resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a\\r\\npity that she was not on my level?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“From what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very\\r\\ndifferent level to your Majesty,” said Holmes coldly. “I am sorry\\r\\nthat I have not been able to bring your Majesty’s business to a more\\r\\nsuccessful conclusion.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On the contrary, my dear sir,” cried the King; “nothing\\r\\ncould be more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is\\r\\nnow as safe as if it were in the fire.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward\\r\\nyou. This ring—” He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger\\r\\nand held it out upon the palm of his hand.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,”\\r\\nsaid Holmes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You have but to name it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This photograph!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe King stared at him in amazement.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Irene’s photograph!” he cried. “Certainly, if you wish\\r\\nit.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I\\r\\nhave the honour to wish you a very good morning.” He bowed, and, turning\\r\\naway without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him, he set\\r\\noff in my company for his chambers.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia,\\r\\nand how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman’s\\r\\nwit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard\\r\\nhim do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her\\r\\nphotograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.\\r\\n'], 'metadata': {'author': ['Arthur Conan Doyle', 'Arthur Conan Doyle'], 'year': tensor([1891, 1891]), 'url': ['https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1661/1661-h/1661-h.htm', 'https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1661/1661-h/1661-h.htm'], 'name': ['five_orange_pips', 'scandal_in_bohemia']}}\n",

As I have reason to believe,\\r\\nhowever, that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public,\\r\\nand as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the\\r\\nmatter up, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little\\r\\nsketch of this remarkable episode.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was still\\r\\nsharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from an afternoon\\r\\nstroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. I had remained indoors\\r\\nall day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal\\r\\nwinds, and the jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a\\r\\nrelic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in one\\r\\neasy-chair and my legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of\\r\\nnewspapers until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all\\r\\naside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope\\r\\nupon the table and wondering lazily who my friend’s noble correspondent\\r\\ncould be.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Here is a very fashionable epistle,” I remarked as he entered.\\r\\n“Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a\\r\\ntide-waiter.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,” he\\r\\nanswered, smiling, “and the humbler are usually the more interesting.\\r\\nThis looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man\\r\\neither to be bored or to lie.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe broke the seal and glanced over the contents.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not social, then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, distinctly professional.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And from a noble client?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“One of the highest in England.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear fellow, I congratulate you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my client\\r\\nis a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case. It is just\\r\\npossible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation.\\r\\nYou have been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It looks like it,” said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in\\r\\nthe corner. “I have had nothing else to do.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read\\r\\nnothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is always\\r\\ninstructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely you must have\\r\\nread about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes, with the deepest interest.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St. Simon.\\r\\nI will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these papers and let me\\r\\nhave whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he says:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—Lord Backwater tells me\\r\\nthat I may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I have\\r\\ndetermined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the\\r\\nvery painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding. Mr.\\r\\nLestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting already in the matter, but he assures me\\r\\nthat he sees no objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it\\r\\nmight be of some assistance. I will call at four o’clock in the\\r\\nafternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time, I hope that\\r\\nyou will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount importance. Yours\\r\\nfaithfully,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘ROBERT ST. SIMON.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the\\r\\nnoble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of\\r\\nhis right little finger,” remarked Holmes as he folded up the epistle.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He says four o’clock. It is three now. He will be here in an\\r\\nhour.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the\\r\\nsubject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of\\r\\ntime, while I take a glance as to who our client is.” He picked a\\r\\nred-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece.\\r\\n“Here he is,” said he, sitting down and flattening it out upon his\\r\\nknee. “‘Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son\\r\\nof the Duke of Balmoral.’ Hum! ‘Arms: Azure, three caltrops in\\r\\nchief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.’ He’s forty-one years of\\r\\nage, which is mature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the colonies in a\\r\\nlate administration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for\\r\\nForeign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on\\r\\nthe distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in all this. I\\r\\nthink that I must turn to you Watson, for something more solid.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have very little difficulty in finding what I want,” said I,\\r\\n“for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable.\\r\\nI feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry on\\r\\nhand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van.\\r\\nThat is quite cleared up now—though, indeed, it was obvious from the\\r\\nfirst. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal column\\r\\nof the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks back: ‘A\\r\\nmarriage has been arranged,’ it says, ‘and will, if rumour is\\r\\ncorrect, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of\\r\\nthe Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius\\r\\nDoran. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.’ That is all.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Terse and to the point,” remarked Holmes, stretching his long,\\r\\nthin legs towards the fire.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of\\r\\nthe same week. Ah, here it is: ‘There will soon be a call for protection\\r\\nin the marriage  market, for the present free-trade principle appears to tell\\r\\nheavily against our home product. One by one the management of the noble houses\\r\\nof Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the\\r\\nAtlantic. An important addition has been made during the last week to the list\\r\\nof the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St.\\r\\nSimon, who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little\\r\\ngod’s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with\\r\\nMiss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss\\r\\nDoran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the\\r\\nWestbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is currently reported that\\r\\nher dowry will run to considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for\\r\\nthe future. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been\\r\\ncompelled to sell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon\\r\\nhas no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious\\r\\nthat the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will\\r\\nenable her to make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a\\r\\nBritish peeress.’”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Anything else?” asked Holmes, yawning.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the Morning Post\\r\\nto say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at\\r\\nSt. George’s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate friends\\r\\nwould be invited, and that the party would return to the furnished house at\\r\\nLancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days\\r\\nlater—that is, on Wednesday last—there is a curt announcement that\\r\\nthe wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord\\r\\nBackwater’s place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices which\\r\\nappeared before the disappearance of the bride.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Before the what?” asked Holmes with a start.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The vanishing of the lady.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When did she vanish, then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“At the wedding breakfast.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic,\\r\\nin fact.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the\\r\\nhoneymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this. Pray let\\r\\nme have the details.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I warn you that they are very incomplete.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps we may make them less so.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning\\r\\npaper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, ‘Singular\\r\\nOccurrence at a Fashionable Wedding’:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into\\r\\nthe greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken\\r\\nplace in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly announced in the\\r\\npapers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning; but it is only now that\\r\\nit has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so\\r\\npersistently floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush\\r\\nthe matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good\\r\\npurpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for\\r\\nconversation.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘The ceremony, which was performed at St. George’s,\\r\\nHanover Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of\\r\\nthe bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord\\r\\nEustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister of the\\r\\nbridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards\\r\\nto the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been\\r\\nprepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman, whose name\\r\\nhas not been ascertained, who endeavoured to force her way into the house after\\r\\nthe bridal party, alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was\\r\\nonly after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and\\r\\nthe footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before this\\r\\nunpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she\\r\\ncomplained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room. Her prolonged\\r\\nabsence having caused some comment, her father followed her, but learned from\\r\\nher maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an\\r\\nulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the footmen declared\\r\\nthat he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused to\\r\\ncredit that it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company. On\\r\\nascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in\\r\\nconjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with\\r\\nthe police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will probably\\r\\nresult in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business. Up to a late\\r\\nhour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the\\r\\nmissing lady. There are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that\\r\\nthe police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original\\r\\ndisturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some other motive, she may\\r\\nhave been concerned in the strange disappearance of the\\r\\nbride.’”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And is that all?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a\\r\\nsuggestive one.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And it is—”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has\\r\\nactually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a danseuse at\\r\\nthe Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years. There are no\\r\\nfurther particulars, and the whole case is in your hands now—so far as it\\r\\nhas been set forth in the public press.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have\\r\\nmissed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as the clock\\r\\nmakes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this will prove to be\\r\\nour noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having\\r\\na witness, if only as a check to my own memory.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Lord Robert St. Simon,” announced our page-boy, throwing open the\\r\\ndoor. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale,\\r\\nwith something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady,\\r\\nwell-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to\\r\\nbe obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue\\r\\nimpression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the\\r\\nknees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat,\\r\\nwas grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was\\r\\ncareful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white\\r\\nwaistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters. He\\r\\nadvanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to right, and\\r\\nswinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good-day, Lord St. Simon,” said Holmes, rising and bowing.\\r\\n“Pray take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson.\\r\\nDraw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr.\\r\\nHolmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have already\\r\\nmanaged several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that they\\r\\nwere hardly from the same class of society.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, I am descending.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I beg pardon.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My last client of the sort was a king.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The King of Scandinavia.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What! Had he lost his wife?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You can understand,” said Holmes suavely, “that I extend to\\r\\nthe affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in\\r\\nyours.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Of course! Very right! very right! I’m sure I beg pardon. As to my\\r\\nown case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in\\r\\nforming an opinion.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints,\\r\\nnothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct—this article, for\\r\\nexample, as to the disappearance of the bride.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLord St. Simon glanced over it. “Yes, it is correct, as far as it\\r\\ngoes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an\\r\\nopinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning\\r\\nyou.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Pray do so.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In San Francisco, a year ago.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You were travelling in the States?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Did you become engaged then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But you were on a friendly footing?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Her father is very rich?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And how did he make his money?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold, invested\\r\\nit, and came up by leaps and bounds.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady’s—your\\r\\nwife’s character?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire.\\r\\n“You see, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “my wife was twenty before\\r\\nher father became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining camp\\r\\nand wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from\\r\\nNature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a\\r\\ntomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of\\r\\ntraditions. She is impetuous—volcanic, I was about to say. She is swift\\r\\nin making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. On the\\r\\nother hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to\\r\\nbear”—he gave a little stately cough—“had I not thought\\r\\nher to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is capable of heroic\\r\\nself-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to\\r\\nher.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Have you her photograph?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I brought this with me.” He opened a locket and showed us the full\\r\\nface of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature,\\r\\nand the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair, the\\r\\nlarge dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at\\r\\nit. Then he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your\\r\\nacquaintance?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met her\\r\\nseveral times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait\\r\\naccompli?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I really have made no inquiries on the subject.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the\\r\\nwedding?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Was she in good spirits?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future\\r\\nlives.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the\\r\\nwedding?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“She was as bright as possible—at least until after the\\r\\nceremony.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And did you observe any change in her then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen\\r\\nthat her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was too trivial\\r\\nto relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Pray let us have it, for all that.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the\\r\\nvestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over into the\\r\\npew. There was a moment’s delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it\\r\\nup to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I\\r\\nspoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on\\r\\nour way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the\\r\\ngeneral public were present, then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is\\r\\nopen.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This gentleman was not one of your wife’s friends?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a\\r\\ncommon-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I think that\\r\\nwe are wandering rather far from the point.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame\\r\\nof mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering her\\r\\nfather’s house?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I saw her in conversation with her maid.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And who is her maid?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California with\\r\\nher.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A confidential servant?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to\\r\\ntake great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these things\\r\\nin a different way.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How long did she speak to this Alice?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You did not overhear what they said?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Lady St. Simon said something about ‘jumping a claim.’ She\\r\\nwas accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do\\r\\nwhen she finished speaking to her maid?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“She walked into the breakfast-room.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On your arm?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then,\\r\\nafter we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some\\r\\nwords of apology, and left the room. She never came back.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her\\r\\nroom, covered her bride’s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and\\r\\nwent out.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company\\r\\nwith Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had already made a\\r\\ndisturbance at Mr. Doran’s house that morning.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and your\\r\\nrelations to her.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. “We have\\r\\nbeen on a friendly footing for some years—I may say on a very\\r\\nfriendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her\\r\\nungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you know\\r\\nwhat women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly\\r\\nhot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she\\r\\nheard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the reason why I\\r\\nhad the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there might be a\\r\\nscandal in the church. She came to Mr. Doran’s door just after we\\r\\nreturned, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very abusive\\r\\nexpressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the\\r\\npossibility of something of the sort, and I had two police fellows there in\\r\\nprivate clothes, who soon pushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that\\r\\nthere was no good in making a row.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Did your wife hear all this?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, thank goodness, she did not.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so\\r\\nserious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible\\r\\ntrap for her.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, it is a possible supposition.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You think so, too?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this as\\r\\nlikely?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is\\r\\nyour own theory as to what took place?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have given\\r\\nyou all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to\\r\\nme as possible that the excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she\\r\\nhad made so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little\\r\\nnervous disturbance in my wife.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back—I will\\r\\nnot say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without\\r\\nsuccess—I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,” said\\r\\nHolmes, smiling. “And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all\\r\\nmy data. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that you\\r\\ncould see out of the window?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We could see the other side of the road and the Park.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I shall\\r\\ncommunicate with you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,” said our\\r\\nclient, rising.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have solved it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Eh? What was that?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I say that I have solved it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Where, then, is my wife?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is a detail which I shall speedily supply.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLord St. Simon shook his head. “I am afraid that it will take wiser heads\\r\\nthan yours or mine,” he remarked, and bowing in a stately, old-fashioned\\r\\nmanner he departed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on a\\r\\nlevel with his own,” said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. “I think that\\r\\nI shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning. I\\r\\nhad formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the\\r\\nroom.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear Holmes!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked\\r\\nbefore, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to turn my\\r\\nconjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very\\r\\nconvincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau’s\\r\\nexample.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But I have heard all that you have heard.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me so\\r\\nwell. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and something\\r\\non very much the same lines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War.\\r\\nIt is one of these cases—but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon,\\r\\nLestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are\\r\\ncigars in the box.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a\\r\\ndecidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand.\\r\\nWith a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been\\r\\noffered to him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What’s up, then?” asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye.\\r\\n“You look dissatisfied.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case. I\\r\\ncan make neither head nor tail of the business.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Really! You surprise me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip through\\r\\nmy fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And very wet it seems to have made you,” said Holmes laying his\\r\\nhand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In Heaven’s name, what for?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In search of the body of Lady St. Simon.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?” he\\r\\nasked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why? What do you mean?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one\\r\\nas in the other.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. “I suppose you know all\\r\\nabout it,” he snarled.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the\\r\\nmatter?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I think it very unlikely.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in\\r\\nit?” He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a\\r\\nwedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a bride’s\\r\\nwreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. “There,” said\\r\\nhe, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. “There is a\\r\\nlittle nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, indeed!” said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air.\\r\\n“You dragged them from the Serpentine?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They have\\r\\nbeen identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the clothes were\\r\\nthere the body would not be far off.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“By the same brilliant reasoning, every man’s body is to be found\\r\\nin the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive at\\r\\nthrough this?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am afraid that you will find it difficult.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Are you, indeed, now?” cried Lestrade with some bitterness.\\r\\n“I am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your\\r\\ndeductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes.\\r\\nThis dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And how?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the card-case\\r\\nis a note. And here is the very note.” He slapped it down upon the table\\r\\nin front of him. “Listen to this: ‘You will see me when all is\\r\\nready. Come at once. F. H. M.’ Now my theory all along has been that Lady\\r\\nSt. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she, with confederates, no\\r\\ndoubt, was responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her initials,\\r\\nis the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door\\r\\nand which lured her within their reach.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very good, Lestrade,” said Holmes, laughing. “You really are\\r\\nvery fine indeed. Let me see it.” He took up the paper in a listless way,\\r\\nbut his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of\\r\\nsatisfaction. “This is indeed important,” said he.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ha! you find it so?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. “Why,” he\\r\\nshrieked, “you’re looking at the wrong side!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On the contrary, this is the right side.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The right side? You’re mad! Here is the note written in pencil\\r\\nover here.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, which\\r\\ninterests me deeply.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There’s nothing in it. I looked at it before,” said\\r\\nLestrade. “‘Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s.\\r\\n6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s. 6d., glass sherry,\\r\\n8d.’ I see nothing in that.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note, it\\r\\nis important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate you\\r\\nagain.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’ve wasted time enough,” said Lestrade, rising. “I\\r\\nbelieve in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories.\\r\\nGood-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter\\r\\nfirst.” He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made\\r\\nfor the door.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Just one hint to you, Lestrade,” drawled Holmes before his rival\\r\\nvanished; “I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St.\\r\\nSimon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such\\r\\nperson.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his\\r\\nforehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat.\\r\\n“There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work,” he\\r\\nremarked, “so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your papers for a\\r\\nlittle.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was after five o’clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time\\r\\nto be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner’s man with\\r\\na very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had\\r\\nbrought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite\\r\\nepicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house\\r\\nmahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a pÃ¢tÃ©\\r\\nde foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid\\r\\nout all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the\\r\\nArabian Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and\\r\\nwere ordered to this address.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nJust before nine o’clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room.\\r\\nHis features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made me\\r\\nthink that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They have laid the supper, then,” he said, rubbing his hands.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You seem to expect company. They have laid for five.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,” said he.\\r\\n“I am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy\\r\\nthat I hear his step now upon the stairs.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in, dangling his\\r\\nglasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon\\r\\nhis aristocratic features.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My messenger reached you, then?” asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have\\r\\nyou good authority for what you say?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The best possible.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What will the Duke say,” he murmured, “when he hears that\\r\\none of the family has been subjected to such humiliation?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any\\r\\nhumiliation.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady\\r\\ncould have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was\\r\\nundoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise her at\\r\\nsuch a crisis.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was a slight, sir, a public slight,” said Lord St. Simon,\\r\\ntapping his fingers upon the table.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a\\r\\nposition.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been\\r\\nshamefully used.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I think that I heard a ring,” said Holmes. “Yes, there are\\r\\nsteps on the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the\\r\\nmatter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more\\r\\nsuccessful.” He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman.\\r\\n“Lord St. Simon,” said he “allow me to introduce you to Mr.\\r\\nand Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood\\r\\nvery erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his\\r\\nfrock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had taken a quick step\\r\\nforward and had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his\\r\\neyes. It was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was one\\r\\nwhich it was hard to resist.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You’re angry, Robert,” said she. “Well, I guess you\\r\\nhave every cause to be.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Pray make no apology to me,” said Lord St. Simon bitterly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should have\\r\\nspoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time when\\r\\nI saw Frank here again I just didn’t know what I was doing or saying. I\\r\\nonly wonder I didn’t fall down and do a faint right there before the\\r\\naltar.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the room\\r\\nwhile you explain this matter?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If I may give an opinion,” remarked the strange gentleman,\\r\\n“we’ve had just a little too much secrecy over this business\\r\\nalready. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights\\r\\nof it.” He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp\\r\\nface and alert manner.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I’ll tell our story right away,” said the lady.\\r\\n“Frank here and I met in ’84, in McQuire’s camp, near the\\r\\nRockies, where Pa was working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and\\r\\nI; but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor\\r\\nFrank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer Pa grew\\r\\nthe poorer was Frank; so at last Pa wouldn’t hear of our engagement\\r\\nlasting any longer, and he took me away to ’Frisco. Frank wouldn’t\\r\\nthrow up his hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without Pa\\r\\nknowing anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just\\r\\nfixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his pile,\\r\\ntoo, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa. So then I\\r\\npromised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry\\r\\nanyone else while he lived. ‘Why shouldn’t we be married right\\r\\naway, then,’ said he, ‘and then I will feel sure of you; and I\\r\\nwon’t claim to be your husband until I come back?’ Well, we talked\\r\\nit over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in\\r\\nwaiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek his\\r\\nfortune, and I went back to Pa.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went\\r\\nprospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After that\\r\\ncame a long newspaper story about how a miners’ camp had been attacked by\\r\\nApache Indians, and there was my Frank’s name among the killed. I fainted\\r\\ndead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline and\\r\\ntook me to half the doctors in ’Frisco. Not a word of news came for a\\r\\nyear and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead. Then Lord\\r\\nSt. Simon came to ’Frisco, and we came to London, and a marriage was\\r\\narranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I felt all the time that no man on this\\r\\nearth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor\\r\\nFrank.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I’d have done my\\r\\nduty by him. We can’t command our love, but we can our actions. I went to\\r\\nthe altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was\\r\\nin me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar\\r\\nrails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the first\\r\\npew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked again there he was\\r\\nstill, with a kind of question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad\\r\\nor sorry to see him. I wonder I didn’t drop. I know that everything was\\r\\nturning round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee\\r\\nin my ear. I didn’t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make a\\r\\nscene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what I was\\r\\nthinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. Then I\\r\\nsaw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that he was writing me a note.\\r\\nAs I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he\\r\\nslipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a\\r\\nline asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so. Of course I\\r\\nnever doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him, and I determined\\r\\nto do just whatever he might direct.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and had\\r\\nalways been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few things\\r\\npacked and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to Lord St. Simon,\\r\\nbut it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people. I just\\r\\nmade up my mind to run away and explain afterwards. I hadn’t been at the\\r\\ntable ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of the\\r\\nroad. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park. I slipped out,\\r\\nput on my things, and followed him. Some woman came talking something or other\\r\\nabout Lord St. Simon to me—seemed to me from the little I heard as if he\\r\\nhad a little secret of his own before marriage also—but I managed to get\\r\\naway from her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away we\\r\\ndrove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my true\\r\\nwedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a prisoner among the\\r\\nApaches, had escaped, came on to ’Frisco, found that I had given him up\\r\\nfor dead and had gone to England, followed me there, and had come upon me at\\r\\nlast on the very morning of my second wedding.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I saw it in a paper,” explained the American. “It gave the\\r\\nname and the church but not where the lady lived.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for\\r\\nopenness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like to\\r\\nvanish away and never see any of them again—just sending a line to Pa,\\r\\nperhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to think of all those\\r\\nlords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come\\r\\nback. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so\\r\\nthat I should not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could\\r\\nfind them. It is likely that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only\\r\\nthat this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how\\r\\nhe found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly\\r\\nthat I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be putting\\r\\nourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to give us a\\r\\nchance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to\\r\\nhis rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if I\\r\\nhave given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very meanly of me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened\\r\\nwith a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Excuse me,” he said, “but it is not my custom to discuss my\\r\\nmost intimate personal affairs in this public manner.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then you won’t forgive me? You won’t shake hands before I\\r\\ngo?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.” He put out his\\r\\nhand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I had hoped,” suggested Holmes, “that you would have joined\\r\\nus in a friendly supper.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I think that there you ask a little too much,” responded his\\r\\nLordship. “I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but\\r\\nI can hardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that with your\\r\\npermission I will now wish you all a very good-night.” He included us all\\r\\nin a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your company,”\\r\\nsaid Sherlock Holmes. “It is always a joy to meet an American, Mr.\\r\\nMoulton, for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the\\r\\nblundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children from\\r\\nbeing some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall\\r\\nbe a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The case has been an interesting one,” remarked Holmes when our\\r\\nvisitors had left us, “because it serves to show very clearly how simple\\r\\nthe explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost\\r\\ninexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as\\r\\nnarrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than the result when viewed, for\\r\\ninstance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You were not yourself at fault at all, then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the lady\\r\\nhad been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other that she had\\r\\nrepented of it within a few minutes of returning home. Obviously something had\\r\\noccurred during the morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could\\r\\nthat something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was out, for\\r\\nshe had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If\\r\\nshe had, it must be someone from America because she had spent so short a time\\r\\nin this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an\\r\\ninfluence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her\\r\\nplans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a process of\\r\\nexclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American. Then who could\\r\\nthis American be, and why should he possess so much influence over her? It\\r\\nmight be a lover; it might be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been\\r\\nspent in rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got before I\\r\\never heard Lord St. Simon’s narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew,\\r\\nof the change in the bride’s manner, of so transparent a device for\\r\\nobtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her\\r\\nconfidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to\\r\\nclaim-jumping—which in miners’ parlance means taking possession of\\r\\nthat which another person has a prior claim to—the whole situation became\\r\\nabsolutely clear. She had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover\\r\\nor was a previous husband—the chances being in favour of the\\r\\nlatter.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And how in the world did you find them?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in\\r\\nhis hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials were, of\\r\\ncourse, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it to know that\\r\\nwithin a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select London\\r\\nhotels.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How did you deduce the select?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a\\r\\nglass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are not many\\r\\nin London which charge at that rate. In the second one which I visited in\\r\\nNorthumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H.\\r\\nMoulton, an American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking\\r\\nover the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I had seen in\\r\\nthe duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so\\r\\nthither I travelled, and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at\\r\\nhome, I ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them\\r\\nthat it would be better in every way that they should make their position a\\r\\nlittle clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular.\\r\\nI invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the\\r\\nappointment.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But with no very good result,” I remarked. “His conduct was\\r\\ncertainly not very gracious.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah, Watson,” said Holmes, smiling, “perhaps you would not be\\r\\nvery gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you\\r\\nfound yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think that we\\r\\nmay judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never\\r\\nlikely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw your chair up and hand me\\r\\nmy violin, for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away\\r\\nthese bleak autumnal evenings.”\\r\\n', '\\nIsa Whitney, brother of\\r\\nthe late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the Theological College of St.\\r\\nGeorge’s, was much addicted to opium. The habit grew upon him, as I\\r\\nunderstand, from some foolish freak when he was at college; for having read De\\r\\nQuincey’s description of his dreams and sensations, he had drenched his\\r\\ntobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects. He found, as\\r\\nso many more have done, that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid\\r\\nof, and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of\\r\\nmingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with\\r\\nyellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a\\r\\nchair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOne night—it was in June, ’89—there came a ring to my bell,\\r\\nabout the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat\\r\\nup in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made a\\r\\nlittle face of disappointment.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A patient!” said she. “You’ll have to go out.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon the\\r\\nlinoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some dark-coloured stuff,\\r\\nwith a black veil, entered the room.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You will excuse my calling so late,” she began, and then, suddenly\\r\\nlosing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my wife’s\\r\\nneck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. “Oh, I’m in such\\r\\ntrouble!” she cried; “I do so want a little help.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why,” said my wife, pulling up her veil, “it is Kate\\r\\nWhitney. How you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you\\r\\ncame in.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I didn’t know what to do, so I came straight to you.” That\\r\\nwas always the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a\\r\\nlighthouse.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and\\r\\nwater, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you rather\\r\\nthat I sent James off to bed?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, no, no! I want the doctor’s advice and help, too. It’s\\r\\nabout Isa. He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about\\r\\nhim!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband’s\\r\\ntrouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion.\\r\\nWe soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find. Did she know where\\r\\nher husband was? Was it possible that we could bring him back to her?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he had, when\\r\\nthe fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the City.\\r\\nHitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had come back,\\r\\ntwitching and shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him\\r\\neight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the dregs of the\\r\\ndocks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects. There he was to be\\r\\nfound, she was sure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what\\r\\nwas she to do? How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a\\r\\nplace and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it. Might I not\\r\\nescort her to this place? And then, as a second thought, why should she come at\\r\\nall? I was Isa Whitney’s medical adviser, and as such I had influence\\r\\nover him. I could manage it better if I were alone. I promised her on my word\\r\\nthat I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the\\r\\naddress which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair\\r\\nand cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a\\r\\nstrange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only could\\r\\nshow how strange it was to be.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure. Upper\\r\\nSwandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the\\r\\nnorth side of the river to the east of London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a\\r\\ngin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap\\r\\nlike the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search. Ordering my\\r\\ncab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the\\r\\nceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp\\r\\nabove the door I found the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick\\r\\nand heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the\\r\\nforecastle of an emigrant ship.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThrough the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange\\r\\nfantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back, and chins\\r\\npointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the\\r\\nnewcomer. Out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light,\\r\\nnow bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the\\r\\nmetal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others\\r\\ntalked together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming\\r\\nin gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his\\r\\nown thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At the\\r\\nfarther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a\\r\\nthree-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw resting\\r\\nupon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the fire.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a\\r\\nsupply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thank you. I have not come to stay,” said I. “There is a\\r\\nfriend of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering through the\\r\\ngloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out at me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My God! It’s Watson,” said he. He was in a pitiable state of\\r\\nreaction, with every nerve in a twitter. “I say, Watson, what\\r\\no’clock is it?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nearly eleven.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Of what day?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Of Friday, June 19th.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What\\r\\nd’you want to frighten a chap for?” He sank his face onto his arms\\r\\nand began to sob in a high treble key.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two\\r\\ndays for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“So I am. But you’ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a\\r\\nfew hours, three pipes, four pipes—I forget how many. But I’ll go\\r\\nhome with you. I wouldn’t frighten Kate—poor little Kate. Give me\\r\\nyour hand! Have you a cab?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I have one waiting.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe,\\r\\nWatson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers, holding my\\r\\nbreath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking about\\r\\nfor the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a\\r\\nsudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, “Walk past me, and\\r\\nthen look back at me.” The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I\\r\\nglanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he\\r\\nsat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium\\r\\npipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer\\r\\nlassitude from his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took\\r\\nall my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment.\\r\\nHe had turned his back so that none could see him but I. His form had filled\\r\\nout, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had regained their fire, and there,\\r\\nsitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes. He made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he\\r\\nturned his face half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering,\\r\\nloose-lipped senility.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Holmes!” I whispered, “what on earth are you doing in this\\r\\nden?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As low as you can,” he answered; “I have excellent ears. If\\r\\nyou would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I\\r\\nshould be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have a cab outside.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he appears\\r\\nto be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you also to send a\\r\\nnote by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with\\r\\nme. If you will wait outside, I shall be with you in five minutes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes’ requests, for they\\r\\nwere always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet air of\\r\\nmastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in the cab my\\r\\nmission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish\\r\\nanything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular\\r\\nadventures which were the normal condition of his existence. In a few minutes I\\r\\nhad written my note, paid Whitney’s bill, led him out to the cab, and\\r\\nseen him driven through the darkness. In a very short time a decrepit figure\\r\\nhad emerged from the opium den, and I was walking down the street with Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes. For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain\\r\\nfoot. Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into\\r\\na hearty fit of laughter.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I suppose, Watson,” said he, “that you imagine that I have\\r\\nadded opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little weaknesses\\r\\non which you have favoured me with your medical views.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was certainly surprised to find you there.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But not more so than I to find you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I came to find a friend.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I to find an enemy.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“An enemy?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey.\\r\\nBriefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I have\\r\\nhoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as I have done\\r\\nbefore now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth\\r\\nan hour’s purchase; for I have used it before now for my own purposes,\\r\\nand the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me. There\\r\\nis a trap-door at the back of that building, near the corner of Paul’s\\r\\nWharf, which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon\\r\\nthe moonless nights.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What! You do not mean bodies?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had Â£ 1000 for every\\r\\npoor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest murder-trap\\r\\non the whole riverside, and I fear that Neville St. Clair has entered it never\\r\\nto leave it more. But our trap should be here.” He put his two\\r\\nforefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly—a signal which was\\r\\nanswered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle\\r\\nof wheels and the clink of horses’ hoofs.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now, Watson,” said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through\\r\\nthe gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side\\r\\nlanterns. “You’ll come with me, won’t you?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If I can be of use.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so.\\r\\nMy room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The Cedars?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair’s house. I am staying there while I\\r\\nconduct the inquiry.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Where is it, then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But I am all in the dark.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Of course you are. You’ll know all about it presently. Jump up\\r\\nhere. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here’s half a crown. Look\\r\\nout for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the endless\\r\\nsuccession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened gradually, until we\\r\\nwere flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing\\r\\nsluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar,\\r\\nits silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman, or the\\r\\nsongs and shouts of some belated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting\\r\\nslowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through\\r\\nthe rifts of the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his\\r\\nbreast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside him,\\r\\ncurious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so\\r\\nsorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts. We had\\r\\ndriven several miles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of\\r\\nsuburban villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his\\r\\npipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the\\r\\nbest.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You have a grand gift of silence, Watson,” said he. “It\\r\\nmakes you quite invaluable as a companion. ’Pon my word, it is a great\\r\\nthing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not\\r\\nover-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman\\r\\nto-night when she meets me at the door.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You forget that I know nothing about it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get\\r\\nto Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to go\\r\\nupon. There’s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can’t get the end\\r\\nof it into my hand. Now, I’ll state the case clearly and concisely to\\r\\nyou, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Proceed, then.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Some years ago—to be definite, in May, 1884—there came to\\r\\nLee a gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of\\r\\nmoney. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived\\r\\ngenerally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood, and\\r\\nin 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now has two\\r\\nchildren. He had no occupation, but was interested in several companies and\\r\\nwent into town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon\\r\\nStreet every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of\\r\\ntemperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is\\r\\npopular with all who know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present\\r\\nmoment, as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to Â£ 88 10s.,\\r\\nwhile he has Â£ 220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank.\\r\\nThere is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been weighing\\r\\nupon his mind.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier than\\r\\nusual, remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to\\r\\nperform, and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks. Now, by\\r\\nthe merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday, very\\r\\nshortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable\\r\\nvalue which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the\\r\\nAberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up in your London, you will\\r\\nknow that the office of the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of\\r\\nUpper Swandam Lane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch,\\r\\nstarted for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company’s\\r\\noffice, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through\\r\\nSwandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me so\\r\\nfar?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is very clear.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St. Clair\\r\\nwalked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not like\\r\\nthe neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was walking in this way\\r\\ndown Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck\\r\\ncold to see her husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning\\r\\nto her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she distinctly saw\\r\\nhis face, which she describes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands\\r\\nfrantically to her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it\\r\\nseemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from\\r\\nbehind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that\\r\\nalthough he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he had on\\r\\nneither collar nor necktie.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the\\r\\nsteps—for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found\\r\\nme to-night—and running through the front room she attempted to ascend\\r\\nthe stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the stairs, however,\\r\\nshe met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and,\\r\\naided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street.\\r\\nFilled with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane and,\\r\\nby rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of constables with an\\r\\ninspector, all on their way to their beat. The inspector and two men\\r\\naccompanied her back, and in spite of the continued resistance of the\\r\\nproprietor, they made their way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last\\r\\nbeen seen. There was no sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor\\r\\nthere was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it\\r\\nseems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one\\r\\nelse had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined was their\\r\\ndenial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to believe that\\r\\nMrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal\\r\\nbox which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell a cascade\\r\\nof children’s bricks. It was the toy which he had promised to bring home.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made\\r\\nthe inspector realise that the matter was serious. The rooms were carefully\\r\\nexamined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. The front room was\\r\\nplainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked\\r\\nout upon the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom\\r\\nwindow is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide\\r\\nwith at least four and a half feet of water. The bedroom window was a broad one\\r\\nand opened from below. On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the\\r\\nwindowsill, and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of\\r\\nthe bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the\\r\\nclothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of his coat. His boots,\\r\\nhis socks, his hat, and his watch—all were there. There were no signs of\\r\\nviolence upon any of these garments, and there were no other traces of Mr.\\r\\nNeville St. Clair. Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other\\r\\nexit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little\\r\\npromise that he could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very\\r\\nhighest at the moment of the tragedy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in\\r\\nthe matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but as,\\r\\nby Mrs. St. Clair’s story, he was known to have been at the foot of the\\r\\nstair within a very few seconds of her husband’s appearance at the\\r\\nwindow, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His\\r\\ndefence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no\\r\\nknowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he could not\\r\\naccount in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman’s clothes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives\\r\\nupon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last human\\r\\nbeing whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his\\r\\nhideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the City.\\r\\nHe is a professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police regulations he\\r\\npretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle\\r\\nStreet, upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small\\r\\nangle in the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,\\r\\ncross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a piteous\\r\\nspectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which\\r\\nlies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the fellow more than once\\r\\nbefore ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance, and I have been\\r\\nsurprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His appearance,\\r\\nyou see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him. A\\r\\nshock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its\\r\\ncontraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and\\r\\na pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the\\r\\ncolour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants\\r\\nand so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of\\r\\nchaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now\\r\\nlearn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been the last man\\r\\nto see the gentleman of whom we are in quest.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But a cripple!” said I. “What could he have done\\r\\nsingle-handed against a man in the prime of life?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other\\r\\nrespects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your medical\\r\\nexperience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is often\\r\\ncompensated for by exceptional strength in the others.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Pray continue your narrative.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window,\\r\\nand she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be of\\r\\nno help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who had charge of\\r\\nthe case, made a very careful examination of the premises, but without finding\\r\\nanything which threw any light upon the matter. One mistake had been made in\\r\\nnot arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes during which\\r\\nhe might have communicated with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon\\r\\nremedied, and he was seized and searched, without anything being found which\\r\\ncould incriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right\\r\\nshirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been cut near the\\r\\nnail, and explained that the bleeding came from there, adding that he had been\\r\\nto the window not long before, and that the stains which had been observed\\r\\nthere came doubtless from the same source. He denied strenuously having ever\\r\\nseen Mr. Neville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his\\r\\nroom was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St.\\r\\nClair’s assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window,\\r\\nhe declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed,\\r\\nloudly protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon the\\r\\npremises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had\\r\\nfeared to find. It was Neville St. Clair’s coat, and not Neville St.\\r\\nClair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think they\\r\\nfound in the pockets?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I cannot imagine.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, I don’t think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with\\r\\npennies and half-pennies—421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no\\r\\nwonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a\\r\\ndifferent matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house. It\\r\\nseemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body\\r\\nhad been sucked away into the river.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room.\\r\\nWould the body be dressed in a coat alone?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that this\\r\\nman Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there is no human\\r\\neye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then? It would of course\\r\\ninstantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would\\r\\nseize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it would occur\\r\\nto him that it would swim and not sink. He has little time, for he has heard\\r\\nthe scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he\\r\\nhas already heard from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up\\r\\nthe street. There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret hoard,\\r\\nwhere he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all the coins\\r\\nupon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the\\r\\ncoat’s sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same with the\\r\\nother garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and only just had time\\r\\nto close the window when the police appeared.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It certainly sounds feasible.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better.\\r\\nBoone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but it could\\r\\nnot be shown that there had ever before been anything against him. He had for\\r\\nyears been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a\\r\\nvery quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and the\\r\\nquestions which have to be solved—what Neville St. Clair was doing in the\\r\\nopium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what Hugh\\r\\nBoone had to do with his disappearance—are all as far from a solution as\\r\\never. I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked\\r\\nat the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events, we had\\r\\nbeen whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling\\r\\nhouses had been left behind, and we rattled along with a country hedge upon\\r\\neither side of us. Just as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered\\r\\nvillages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We are on the outskirts of Lee,” said my companion. “We have\\r\\ntouched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex,\\r\\npassing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light among the\\r\\ntrees? That is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears\\r\\nhave already, I have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse’s\\r\\nfeet.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?” I\\r\\nasked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs. St.\\r\\nClair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest assured\\r\\nthat she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague. I hate to\\r\\nmeet her, Watson, when I have no news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa, there,\\r\\nwhoa!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds.\\r\\nA stable-boy had run out to the horse’s head, and springing down, I\\r\\nfollowed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to the house. As\\r\\nwe approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the\\r\\nopening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy\\r\\npink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined against\\r\\nthe flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness,\\r\\nher body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted\\r\\nlips, a standing question.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well?” she cried, “well?” And then, seeing that there\\r\\nwere two of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that\\r\\nmy companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No good news?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“None.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No bad?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a\\r\\nlong day.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in\\r\\nseveral of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring\\r\\nhim out and associate him with this investigation.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am delighted to see you,” said she, pressing my hand warmly.\\r\\n“You will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our\\r\\narrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon\\r\\nus.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear madam,” said I, “I am an old campaigner, and if I\\r\\nwere not I can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of any\\r\\nassistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed happy.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said the lady as we entered a well-lit\\r\\ndining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out, “I\\r\\nshould very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to which I beg\\r\\nthat you will give a plain answer.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Certainly, madam.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to\\r\\nfainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Upon what point?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. “Frankly,\\r\\nnow!” she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him\\r\\nas he leaned back in a basket-chair.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Frankly, then, madam, I do not.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You think that he is dead?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I do.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Murdered?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I don’t say that. Perhaps.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And on what day did he meet his death?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On Monday.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is\\r\\nthat I have received a letter from him to-day.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What!” he roared.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, to-day.” She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper\\r\\nin the air.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“May I see it?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Certainly.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the table\\r\\nhe drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I had left my chair and was\\r\\ngazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a very coarse one and was\\r\\nstamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day, or\\r\\nrather of the day before, for it was considerably after midnight.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Coarse writing,” murmured Holmes. “Surely this is not your\\r\\nhusband’s writing, madam.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, but the enclosure is.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and\\r\\ninquire as to the address.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How can you tell that?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself.\\r\\nThe rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has been\\r\\nused. If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none would be of a\\r\\ndeep black shade. This man has written the name, and there has then been a\\r\\npause before he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not familiar\\r\\nwith it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as\\r\\ntrifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha! there has been an enclosure\\r\\nhere!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And you are sure that this is your husband’s hand?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“One of his hands.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“One?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing,\\r\\nand yet I know it well.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is\\r\\na huge error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in\\r\\npatience.—NEVILLE.’ Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book,\\r\\noctavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man with a\\r\\ndirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very much in error,\\r\\nby a person who had been chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is your\\r\\nhusband’s hand, madam?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“None. Neville wrote those words.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the\\r\\nclouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is\\r\\nover.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The ring,\\r\\nafter all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only posted\\r\\nto-day.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is possible.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If so, much may have happened between.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well with\\r\\nhim. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if evil came\\r\\nupon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom,\\r\\nand yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost\\r\\ncertainty that something had happened. Do you think that I would respond to\\r\\nsuch a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be\\r\\nmore valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. And in this letter\\r\\nyou certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view.\\r\\nBut if your husband is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain\\r\\naway from you?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very much so.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Was the window open?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then he might have called to you?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He might.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A call for help, you thought?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes. He waved his hands.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the unexpected\\r\\nsight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is possible.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And you thought he was pulled back?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He disappeared so suddenly.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the\\r\\nroom?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the Lascar\\r\\nwas at the foot of the stairs.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary\\r\\nclothes on?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Never.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Never.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which I\\r\\nwished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and then\\r\\nretire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and\\r\\nI was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after my night of adventure.\\r\\nSherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon\\r\\nhis mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it\\r\\nover, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he\\r\\nhad either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient. It\\r\\nwas soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He\\r\\ntook off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then\\r\\nwandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the\\r\\nsofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon\\r\\nwhich he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box\\r\\nof matches laid out in front of him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him\\r\\nsitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon\\r\\nthe corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent,\\r\\nmotionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he\\r\\nsat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused\\r\\nme to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. The pipe\\r\\nwas still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was\\r\\nfull of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I\\r\\nhad seen upon the previous night.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Awake, Watson?” he asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Game for a morning drive?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Certainly.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy\\r\\nsleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.” He chuckled to himself as\\r\\nhe spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre\\r\\nthinker of the previous night.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was stirring.\\r\\nIt was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished when Holmes\\r\\nreturned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I want to test a little theory of mine,” said he, pulling on his\\r\\nboots. “I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one\\r\\nof the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from here to\\r\\nCharing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And where is it?” I asked, smiling.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In the bathroom,” he answered. “Oh, yes, I am not\\r\\njoking,” he continued, seeing my look of incredulity. “I have just\\r\\nbeen there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag.\\r\\nCome on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the bright\\r\\nmorning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad\\r\\nstable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away we dashed down the\\r\\nLondon Road. A few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the\\r\\nmetropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless\\r\\nas some city in a dream.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It has been in some points a singular case,” said Holmes, flicking\\r\\nthe horse on into a gallop. “I confess that I have been as blind as a\\r\\nmole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at\\r\\nall.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their\\r\\nwindows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side. Passing down the\\r\\nWaterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and dashing up Wellington\\r\\nStreet wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes was well known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted\\r\\nhim. One of them held the horse’s head while the other led us in.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Who is on duty?” asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Inspector Bradstreet, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?” A tall, stout official had come down\\r\\nthe stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. “I wish to\\r\\nhave a quiet word with you, Bradstreet.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a\\r\\ntelephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his desk.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I called about that beggarman, Boone—the one who was charged with\\r\\nbeing concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“So I heard. You have him here?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In the cells.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Is he quiet?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Dirty?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as\\r\\nblack as a tinker’s. Well, when once his case has been settled, he will\\r\\nhave a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would agree with\\r\\nme that he needed it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I should like to see him very much.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your\\r\\nbag.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, I think that I’ll take it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very good. Come this way, if you please.” He led us down a\\r\\npassage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a\\r\\nwhitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The third on the right is his,” said the inspector. “Here it\\r\\nis!” He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and\\r\\nglanced through.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He is asleep,” said he. “You can see him very well.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face towards us,\\r\\nin a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was a middle-sized man,\\r\\ncoarsely clad as became his calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through\\r\\nthe rent in his tattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremely\\r\\ndirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive\\r\\nugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin,\\r\\nand by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three\\r\\nteeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew\\r\\nlow over his eyes and forehead.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He’s a beauty, isn’t he?” said the inspector.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He certainly needs a wash,” remarked Holmes. “I had an idea\\r\\nthat he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.” He\\r\\nopened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very\\r\\nlarge bath-sponge.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He! he! You are a funny one,” chuckled the inspector.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly,\\r\\nwe will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, I don’t know why not,” said the inspector. “He\\r\\ndoesn’t look a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?” He slipped\\r\\nhis key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper\\r\\nhalf turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes\\r\\nstooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice\\r\\nvigorously across and down the prisoner’s face.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Let me introduce you,” he shouted, “to Mr. Neville St.\\r\\nClair, of Lee, in the county of Kent.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNever in my life have I seen such a sight. The man’s face peeled off\\r\\nunder the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown tint!\\r\\nGone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and the twisted lip\\r\\nwhich had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the\\r\\ntangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced,\\r\\nrefined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and\\r\\nstaring about him with sleepy bewilderment. Then suddenly realising the\\r\\nexposure, he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the\\r\\npillow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Great heavens!” cried the inspector, “it is, indeed, the\\r\\nmissing man. I know him from the photograph.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his\\r\\ndestiny. “Be it so,” said he. “And pray what am I charged\\r\\nwith?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“With making away with Mr. Neville St.— Oh, come, you can’t\\r\\nbe charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,”\\r\\nsaid the inspector with a grin. “Well, I have been twenty-seven years in\\r\\nthe force, but this really takes the cake.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has been\\r\\ncommitted, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No crime, but a very great error has been committed,” said Holmes.\\r\\n“You would have done better to have trusted your wife.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was not the wife; it was the children,” groaned the prisoner.\\r\\n“God help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What\\r\\nan exposure! What can I do?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the\\r\\nshoulder.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,” said\\r\\nhe, “of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you\\r\\nconvince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you, I\\r\\ndo not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way\\r\\ninto the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon\\r\\nanything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The\\r\\ncase would then never go into court at all.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“God bless you!” cried the prisoner passionately. “I would\\r\\nhave endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my\\r\\nmiserable secret as a family blot to my children.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a\\r\\nschoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education. I\\r\\ntravelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an\\r\\nevening paper in London. One day my editor wished to have a series of articles\\r\\nupon begging in the metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them. There was the\\r\\npoint from which all my adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an\\r\\namateur that I could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an\\r\\nactor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been\\r\\nfamous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my attainments.\\r\\nI painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good\\r\\nscar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of\\r\\nflesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress,\\r\\nI took my station in the business part of the city, ostensibly as a\\r\\nmatch-seller but really as a beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when\\r\\nI returned home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no\\r\\nless than 26s. 4d.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some\\r\\ntime later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for Â£\\r\\n25. I was at my wit’s end where to get the money, but a sudden idea came\\r\\nto me. I begged a fortnight’s grace from the creditor, asked for a\\r\\nholiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the City under my\\r\\ndisguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at\\r\\nÂ£ 2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face\\r\\nwith a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still. It was a\\r\\nlong fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I\\r\\nthrew up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first\\r\\nchosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers.\\r\\nOnly one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to\\r\\nlodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar\\r\\nand in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This\\r\\nfellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that my\\r\\nsecret was safe in his possession.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money. I\\r\\ndo not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn Â£ 700 a\\r\\nyear—which is less than my average takings—but I had exceptional\\r\\nadvantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee, which\\r\\nimproved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City. All\\r\\nday a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, and it was a very\\r\\nbad day in which I failed to take Â£ 2.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country, and\\r\\neventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation.\\r\\nMy dear wife knew that I had business in the City. She little knew what.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above\\r\\nthe opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my horror and\\r\\nastonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her eyes fixed full\\r\\nupon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and,\\r\\nrushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from\\r\\ncoming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that she could not\\r\\nascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on\\r\\nmy pigments and wig. Even a wife’s eyes could not pierce so complete a\\r\\ndisguise. But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room,\\r\\nand that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by my\\r\\nviolence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that\\r\\nmorning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the coppers which I had\\r\\njust transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings. I\\r\\nhurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other\\r\\nclothes would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of constables\\r\\nup the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief,\\r\\nthat instead of being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as\\r\\nhis murderer.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was\\r\\ndetermined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference\\r\\nfor a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slipped off\\r\\nmy ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was\\r\\nwatching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause\\r\\nto fear.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That note only reached her yesterday,” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good God! What a week she must have spent!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The police have watched this Lascar,” said Inspector Bradstreet,\\r\\n“and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a\\r\\nletter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who\\r\\nforgot all about it for some days.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That was it,” said Holmes, nodding approvingly; “I have no\\r\\ndoubt of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Many times; but what was a fine to me?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It must stop here, however,” said Bradstreet. “If the police\\r\\nare to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be\\r\\ntaken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure, Mr.\\r\\nHolmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up.\\r\\nI wish I knew how you reach your results.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I reached this one,” said my friend, “by sitting upon five\\r\\npillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to\\r\\nBaker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast.”\\r\\n'], 'metadata': {'author': ['Arthur Conan Doyle', 'Arthur Conan Doyle'], 'year': tensor([1891, 1891]), 'url': ['https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1661/1661-h/1661-h.htm', 'https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1661/1661-h/1661-h.htm'], 'name': ['noble_bachelor', 'twisted_lip']}}\n",
      "{'name': ['Sherlock Holmes - The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle', 'Sherlock Holmes - The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet'], 'body': ['\\nI had called upon my\\r\\nfriend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, with the\\r\\nintention of wishing him the compliments of the season. He was lounging upon\\r\\nthe sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the\\r\\nright, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at\\r\\nhand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a\\r\\nvery seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked\\r\\nin several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair\\r\\nsuggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of\\r\\nexamination.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are engaged,” said I; “perhaps I interrupt you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my\\r\\nresults. The matter is a perfectly trivial one”—he jerked his thumb\\r\\nin the direction of the old hat—“but there are points in connection\\r\\nwith it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of\\r\\ninstruction.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire,\\r\\nfor a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystals.\\r\\n“I suppose,” I remarked, “that, homely as it looks, this\\r\\nthing has some deadly story linked on to it—that it is the clue which\\r\\nwill guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some\\r\\ncrime.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, no. No crime,” said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. “Only one\\r\\nof those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four\\r\\nmillion human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square\\r\\nmiles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every\\r\\npossible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a little\\r\\nproblem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being\\r\\ncriminal. We have already had experience of such.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“So much so,” I remarked, “that of the last six cases which I\\r\\nhave added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal\\r\\ncrime.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers,\\r\\nto the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man\\r\\nwith the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small matter will fall\\r\\ninto the same innocent category. You know Peterson, the commissionaire?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is to him that this trophy belongs.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is his hat.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look upon\\r\\nit not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem. And, first, as\\r\\nto how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning, in company with a good\\r\\nfat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of\\r\\nPeterson’s fire. The facts are these: about four o’clock on\\r\\nChristmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was\\r\\nreturning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down\\r\\nTottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man,\\r\\nwalking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over his\\r\\nshoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between\\r\\nthis stranger and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the\\r\\nman’s hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging\\r\\nit over his head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed\\r\\nforward to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at\\r\\nhaving broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniform\\r\\nrushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid\\r\\nthe labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road.\\r\\nThe roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in\\r\\npossession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the\\r\\nshape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Which surely he restored to their owner?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that ‘For Mrs.\\r\\nHenry Baker’ was printed upon a small card which was tied to the\\r\\nbird’s left leg, and it is also true that the initials ‘H.\\r\\nB.’ are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some\\r\\nthousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it\\r\\nis not easy to restore lost property to any one of them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What, then, did Peterson do?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning, knowing\\r\\nthat even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The goose we retained\\r\\nuntil this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the slight frost,\\r\\nit would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder\\r\\nhas carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while\\r\\nI continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas\\r\\ndinner.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Did he not advertise?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Only as much as we can deduce.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“From his hat?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Precisely.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered\\r\\nfelt?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as to\\r\\nthe individuality of the man who has worn this article?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. It\\r\\nwas a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the worse\\r\\nfor wear. The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured.\\r\\nThere was no maker’s name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials\\r\\n“H. B.” were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for\\r\\na hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was cracked,\\r\\nexceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have\\r\\nbeen some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I can see nothing,” said I, handing it back to my friend.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to\\r\\nreason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was\\r\\ncharacteristic of him. “It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have\\r\\nbeen,” he remarked, “and yet there are a few inferences which are\\r\\nvery distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of\\r\\nprobability. That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the\\r\\nface of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years,\\r\\nalthough he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less now\\r\\nthan formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the\\r\\ndecline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink,\\r\\nat work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has\\r\\nceased to love him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear Holmes!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,” he\\r\\ncontinued, disregarding my remonstrance. “He is a man who leads a\\r\\nsedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged,\\r\\nhas grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he\\r\\nanoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are to be\\r\\ndeduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he\\r\\nhas gas laid on in his house.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are certainly joking, Holmes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these\\r\\nresults, you are unable to see how they are attained?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am\\r\\nunable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was\\r\\nintellectual?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFor answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the\\r\\nforehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. “It is a question of\\r\\ncubic capacity,” said he; “a man with so large a brain must have\\r\\nsomething in it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The decline of his fortunes, then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came in\\r\\nthen. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and\\r\\nthe excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three\\r\\nyears ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the\\r\\nworld.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and\\r\\nthe moral retrogression?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes laughed. “Here is the foresight,” said he putting\\r\\nhis finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. “They are\\r\\nnever sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount\\r\\nof foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the\\r\\nwind. But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to\\r\\nreplace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which\\r\\nis a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he has\\r\\nendeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with\\r\\nink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your reasoning is certainly plausible.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled,\\r\\nthat it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be\\r\\ngathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens\\r\\ndiscloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber.\\r\\nThey all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream.\\r\\nThis dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the\\r\\nfluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most\\r\\nof the time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive\\r\\nthat the wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the\\r\\nbest of training.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But his wife—you said that she had ceased to love him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson,\\r\\nwith a week’s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife\\r\\nallows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been\\r\\nunfortunate enough to lose your wife’s affection.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But he might be a bachelor.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife.\\r\\nRemember the card upon the bird’s leg.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that\\r\\nthe gas is not laid on in his house?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no\\r\\nless than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must\\r\\nbe brought into frequent contact with burning tallow—walks upstairs at\\r\\nnight probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other.\\r\\nAnyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, it is very ingenious,” said I, laughing; “but since,\\r\\nas you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save\\r\\nthe loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and\\r\\nPeterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and\\r\\nthe face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!” he gasped.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off through\\r\\nthe kitchen window?” Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a\\r\\nfairer view of the man’s excited face.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!” He held out\\r\\nhis hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating\\r\\nblue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance\\r\\nthat it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. “By Jove, Peterson!” said\\r\\nhe, “this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have\\r\\ngot?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were\\r\\nputty.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It’s more than a precious stone. It is the precious\\r\\nstone.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not the Countess of Morcar’s blue carbuncle!” I ejaculated.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have\\r\\nread the advertisement about it in The Times every day lately. It is\\r\\nabsolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward\\r\\noffered of Â£ 1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market\\r\\nprice.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!” The commissionaire\\r\\nplumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are sentimental\\r\\nconsiderations in the background which would induce the Countess to part with\\r\\nhalf her fortune if she could but recover the gem.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan,” I\\r\\nremarked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, a\\r\\nplumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady’s jewel-case.\\r\\nThe evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the\\r\\nAssizes. I have some account of the matter here, I believe.” He rummaged\\r\\namid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one\\r\\nout, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was brought\\r\\nup upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted from the\\r\\njewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue\\r\\ncarbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the\\r\\neffect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess of\\r\\nMorcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar\\r\\nof the grate, which was loose. He had remained with Horner some little time,\\r\\nbut had finally been called away. On returning, he found that Horner had\\r\\ndisappeared, that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco\\r\\ncasket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to\\r\\nkeep her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly gave\\r\\nthe alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be\\r\\nfound either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to the\\r\\nCountess, deposed to having heard Ryder’s cry of dismay on discovering\\r\\nthe robbery, and to having rushed into the room, where she found matters as\\r\\ndescribed by the last witness. Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence\\r\\nas to the arrest of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his\\r\\ninnocence in the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery\\r\\nhaving been given against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal\\r\\nsummarily with the offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had\\r\\nshown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the\\r\\nconclusion and was carried out of court.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hum! So much for the police-court,” said Holmes thoughtfully,\\r\\ntossing aside the paper. “The question for us now to solve is the\\r\\nsequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a\\r\\ngoose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our little\\r\\ndeductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent\\r\\naspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came\\r\\nfrom Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other\\r\\ncharacteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set ourselves very\\r\\nseriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in\\r\\nthis little mystery. To do this, we must try the simplest means first, and\\r\\nthese lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this\\r\\nfail, I shall have recourse to other methods.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What will you say?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: ‘Found at the\\r\\ncorner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can have\\r\\nthe same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker Street.’ That is\\r\\nclear and concise.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very. But will he see it?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the\\r\\nloss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the\\r\\nwindow and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of nothing but flight,\\r\\nbut since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to\\r\\ndrop his bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see\\r\\nit, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are,\\r\\nPeterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening\\r\\npapers.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In which, sir?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St.\\r\\nJames’s Gazette, Evening News, Standard, Echo,\\r\\nand any others that occur to you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very well, sir. And this stone?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson, just\\r\\nbuy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must have one to\\r\\ngive to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now\\r\\ndevouring.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it against\\r\\nthe light. “It’s a bonny thing,” said he. “Just see how\\r\\nit glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. Every\\r\\ngood stone is. They are the devil’s pet baits. In the larger and older\\r\\njewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty\\r\\nyears old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is\\r\\nremarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is\\r\\nblue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has already a\\r\\nsinister history. There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide,\\r\\nand several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of\\r\\ncrystallised charcoal. Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor\\r\\nto the gallows and the prison? I’ll lock it up in my strong box now and\\r\\ndrop a line to the Countess to say that we have it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I cannot tell.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had\\r\\nanything to do with the matter?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely\\r\\ninnocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of\\r\\nconsiderably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That, however, I\\r\\nshall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our\\r\\nadvertisement.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And you can do nothing until then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nothing.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come\\r\\nback in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like to see\\r\\nthe solution of so tangled a business.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe.\\r\\nBy the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson\\r\\nto examine its crop.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six when I\\r\\nfound myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached the house I saw a tall\\r\\nman in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting\\r\\noutside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I\\r\\narrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to Holmes’\\r\\nroom.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Henry Baker, I believe,” said he, rising from his armchair and\\r\\ngreeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily\\r\\nassume. “Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is a cold night,\\r\\nand I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter.\\r\\nAh, Watson, you have just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr.\\r\\nBaker?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad,\\r\\nintelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A touch of\\r\\nred in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled\\r\\nHolmes’ surmise as to his habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned\\r\\nright up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded\\r\\nfrom his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato\\r\\nfashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the impression generally of a\\r\\nman of learning and letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We have retained these things for some days,” said Holmes,\\r\\n“because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your\\r\\naddress. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOur visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. “Shillings have not been so\\r\\nplentiful with me as they once were,” he remarked. “I had no doubt\\r\\nthat the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the\\r\\nbird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering\\r\\nthem.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat\\r\\nit.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“To eat it!” Our visitor half rose from his chair in his\\r\\nexcitement.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I\\r\\npresume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same\\r\\nweight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, certainly, certainly,” answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of\\r\\nrelief.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own\\r\\nbird, so if you wish—”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe man burst into a hearty laugh. “They might be useful to me as relics\\r\\nof my adventure,” said he, “but beyond that I can hardly see what\\r\\nuse the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me.\\r\\nNo, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to\\r\\nthe excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his\\r\\nshoulders.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There is your hat, then, and there your bird,” said he. “By\\r\\nthe way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am\\r\\nsomewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Certainly, sir,” said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly\\r\\ngained property under his arm. “There are a few of us who frequent the\\r\\nAlpha Inn, near the Museum—we are to be found in the Museum itself during\\r\\nthe day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted\\r\\na goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were\\r\\neach to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest is\\r\\nfamiliar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted\\r\\nneither to my years nor my gravity.” With a comical pomposity of manner\\r\\nhe bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“So much for Mr. Henry Baker,” said Holmes when he had closed the\\r\\ndoor behind him. “It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever\\r\\nabout the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not particularly.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this\\r\\nclue while it is still hot.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“By all means.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our\\r\\nthroats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and the\\r\\nbreath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots. Our\\r\\nfootfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors’\\r\\nquarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into\\r\\nOxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn,\\r\\nwhich is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs\\r\\ndown into Holborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered\\r\\ntwo glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,”\\r\\nsaid he.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My geese!” The man seemed surprised.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was a\\r\\nmember of your goose club.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them’s not our\\r\\ngeese.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Indeed! Whose, then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Breckinridge is his name.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah! I don’t know him. Well, here’s your good health\\r\\nlandlord, and prosperity to your house. Good-night.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now for Mr. Breckinridge,” he continued, buttoning up his coat as\\r\\nwe came out into the frosty air. “Remember, Watson that though we have so\\r\\nhomely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the other a man\\r\\nwho will certainly get seven years’ penal servitude unless we can\\r\\nestablish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his\\r\\nguilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation which has been missed\\r\\nby the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us\\r\\nfollow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and quick\\r\\nmarch!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag of slums\\r\\nto Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the name of\\r\\nBreckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man, with a sharp\\r\\nface and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good-evening. It’s a cold night,” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Sold out of geese, I see,” continued Holmes, pointing at the bare\\r\\nslabs of marble.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That’s no good.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah, but I was recommended to you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Who by?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The landlord of the Alpha.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now, then, mister,” said he, with his head cocked and his arms\\r\\nakimbo, “what are you driving at? Let’s have it straight,\\r\\nnow.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese\\r\\nwhich you supplied to the Alpha.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well then, I shan’t tell you. So now!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don’t know why you\\r\\nshould be so warm over such a trifle.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Warm! You’d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am.\\r\\nWhen I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the\\r\\nbusiness; but it’s ‘Where are the geese?’ and ‘Who did\\r\\nyou sell the geese to?’ and ‘What will you take for the\\r\\ngeese?’ One would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear\\r\\nthe fuss that is made over them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making\\r\\ninquiries,” said Holmes carelessly. “If you won’t tell us the\\r\\nbet is off, that is all. But I’m always ready to back my opinion on a\\r\\nmatter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country\\r\\nbred.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, then, you’ve lost your fiver, for it’s town\\r\\nbred,” snapped the salesman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It’s nothing of the kind.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I say it is.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I don’t believe it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“D’you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled\\r\\nthem ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the\\r\\nAlpha were town bred.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You’ll never persuade me to believe that.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Will you bet, then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It’s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But\\r\\nI’ll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be\\r\\nobstinate.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe salesman chuckled grimly. “Bring me the books, Bill,” said he.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one,\\r\\nlaying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now then, Mr. Cocksure,” said the salesman, “I thought that\\r\\nI was out of geese, but before I finish you’ll find that there is still\\r\\none left in my shop. You see this little book?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That’s the list of the folk from whom I buy. D’you see?\\r\\nWell, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their\\r\\nnames are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then! You see this\\r\\nother page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town suppliers. Now, look at\\r\\nthat third name. Just read it out to me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road—249,” read Holmes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHolmes turned to the page indicated. “Here you are, ‘Mrs. Oakshott,\\r\\n117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.’”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now, then, what’s the last entry?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s.\\r\\n6d.’”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Quite so. There you are. And underneath?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at\\r\\n12s.’”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What have you to say now?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his pocket\\r\\nand threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man whose\\r\\ndisgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post and\\r\\nlaughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the ‘Pink\\r\\n’un’ protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a\\r\\nbet,” said he. “I daresay that if I had put Â£ 100 down in front of\\r\\nhim, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn\\r\\nfrom him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I\\r\\nfancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be\\r\\ndetermined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or\\r\\nwhether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what that surly\\r\\nfellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the\\r\\nmatter, and I should—”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHis remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the\\r\\nstall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow\\r\\nstanding in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the\\r\\nswinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his\\r\\nstall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’ve had enough of you and your geese,” he shouted. “I\\r\\nwish you were all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with\\r\\nyour silly talk I’ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and\\r\\nI’ll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese off\\r\\nyou?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No; but one of them was mine all the same,” whined the little man.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“She told me to ask you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I’ve had\\r\\nenough of it. Get out of this!” He rushed fiercely forward, and the\\r\\ninquirer flitted away into the darkness.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,” whispered Holmes.\\r\\n“Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.”\\r\\nStriding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring\\r\\nstalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the\\r\\nshoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige\\r\\nof colour had been driven from his face.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Who are you, then? What do you want?” he asked in a quavering\\r\\nvoice.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You will excuse me,” said Holmes blandly, “but I could not\\r\\nhelp overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I think\\r\\nthat I could be of assistance to you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people\\r\\ndon’t know.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But you can know nothing of this?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to trace some\\r\\ngeese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman named\\r\\nBreckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his\\r\\nclub, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,” cried\\r\\nthe little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. “I can\\r\\nhardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. “In that case we\\r\\nhad better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept\\r\\nmarket-place,” said he. “But pray tell me, before we go farther,\\r\\nwho it is that I have the pleasure of assisting.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe man hesitated for an instant. “My name is John Robinson,” he\\r\\nanswered with a sidelong glance.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, no; the real name,” said Holmes sweetly. “It is always\\r\\nawkward doing business with an alias.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. “Well then,”\\r\\nsaid he, “my real name is James Ryder.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into\\r\\nthe cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish\\r\\nto know.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened,\\r\\nhalf-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a\\r\\nwindfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour\\r\\nwe were back in the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during\\r\\nour drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and the claspings\\r\\nand unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Here we are!” said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room.\\r\\n“The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr.\\r\\nRyder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers before we\\r\\nsettle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what became of\\r\\nthose geese?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in which\\r\\nyou were interested—white, with a black bar across the tail.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nRyder quivered with emotion. “Oh, sir,” he cried, “can you\\r\\ntell me where it went to?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It came here.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Here?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don’t wonder that you\\r\\nshould take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead—the\\r\\nbonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here in my\\r\\nmuseum.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOur visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right\\r\\nhand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle, which\\r\\nshone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder\\r\\nstood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The game’s up, Ryder,” said Holmes quietly. “Hold up,\\r\\nman, or you’ll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair,\\r\\nWatson. He’s not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give\\r\\nhim a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it\\r\\nis, to be sure!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFor a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge\\r\\nof colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his\\r\\naccuser.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could\\r\\npossibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that little\\r\\nmay as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had heard, Ryder, of\\r\\nthis blue stone of the Countess of Morcar’s?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,” said he in a crackling\\r\\nvoice.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I see—her ladyship’s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of\\r\\nsudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for\\r\\nbetter men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used.\\r\\nIt seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very pretty villain in\\r\\nyou. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some\\r\\nsuch matter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him.\\r\\nWhat did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady’s\\r\\nroom—you and your confederate Cusack—and you managed that he should\\r\\nbe the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised\\r\\nthe alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested. You then—”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nRyder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my\\r\\ncompanion’s knees. “For God’s sake, have mercy!” he\\r\\nshrieked. “Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts.\\r\\nI never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I’ll swear it\\r\\non a Bible. Oh, don’t bring it into court! For Christ’s sake,\\r\\ndon’t!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Get back into your chair!” said Holmes sternly. “It is very\\r\\nwell to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner\\r\\nin the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge\\r\\nagainst him will break down.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of the\\r\\nnext act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the\\r\\nopen market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nRyder passed his tongue over his parched lips. “I will tell you it just\\r\\nas it happened, sir,” said he. “When Horner had been arrested, it\\r\\nseemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once,\\r\\nfor I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads\\r\\nto search me and my room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be\\r\\nsafe. I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister’s\\r\\nhouse. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road, where\\r\\nshe fattened fowls for the market. All the way there every man I met seemed to\\r\\nme to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the\\r\\nsweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister\\r\\nasked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had\\r\\nbeen upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard\\r\\nand smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just\\r\\nbeen serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell into talk\\r\\nabout the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what they stole. I\\r\\nknew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I\\r\\nmade up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my\\r\\nconfidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money. But how to get\\r\\nto him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from\\r\\nthe hotel. I might at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the\\r\\nstone in my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and\\r\\nlooking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an\\r\\nidea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that\\r\\never lived.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of\\r\\nher geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as\\r\\nher word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to\\r\\nKilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of\\r\\nthe birds—a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and\\r\\nprying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger\\r\\ncould reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet\\r\\nand down into its crop. But the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my\\r\\nsister to know what was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke\\r\\nloose and fluttered off among the others.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?’ says\\r\\nshe.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Well,’ said I, ‘you said you’d give me\\r\\none for Christmas, and I was feeling which was the fattest.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Oh,’ says she, ‘we’ve set yours aside for\\r\\nyou—Jem’s bird, we call it. It’s the big white one over\\r\\nyonder. There’s twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for\\r\\nus, and two dozen for the market.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Thank you, Maggie,’ says I; ‘but if it is all\\r\\nthe same to you, I’d rather have that one I was handling just now.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘The other is a good three pound heavier,’ said she,\\r\\n‘and we fattened it expressly for you.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Never mind. I’ll have the other, and I’ll take\\r\\nit now,’ said I.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Oh, just as you like,’ said she, a little huffed.\\r\\n‘Which is it you want, then?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of\\r\\nthe flock.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the\\r\\nway to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it was\\r\\neasy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, and we got a\\r\\nknife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of\\r\\nthe stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird,\\r\\nrushed back to my sister’s, and hurried into the back yard. There was not\\r\\na bird to be seen there.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Where are they all, Maggie?’ I cried.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Gone to the dealer’s, Jem.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Which dealer’s?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘But was there another with a barred tail?’ I asked,\\r\\n‘the same as the one I chose?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could\\r\\nnever tell them apart.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet\\r\\nwould carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and\\r\\nnot one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You heard him\\r\\nyourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like that. My sister\\r\\nthinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am myself. And\\r\\nnow—and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the\\r\\nwealth for which I sold my character. God help me! God help me!” He burst\\r\\ninto convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the\\r\\nmeasured tapping of Sherlock Holmes’ finger-tips upon the edge of the\\r\\ntable. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Get out!” said he.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No more words. Get out!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the stairs, the\\r\\nbang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“After all, Watson,” said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay\\r\\npipe, “I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If\\r\\nHorner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will not\\r\\nappear against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a\\r\\nfelony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not\\r\\ngo wrong again; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and you\\r\\nmake him a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of forgiveness. Chance\\r\\nhas put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is\\r\\nits own reward. If you will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we\\r\\nwill begin another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief\\r\\nfeature.”\\r\\n', '\\n“Holmes,”\\r\\nsaid I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down the street,\\r\\n“here is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that his relatives\\r\\nshould allow him to come out alone.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets\\r\\nof his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a bright, crisp February\\r\\nmorning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground,\\r\\nshimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had\\r\\nbeen ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and\\r\\non the heaped-up edges of the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell.\\r\\nThe grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously\\r\\nslippery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the\\r\\ndirection of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single\\r\\ngentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive,\\r\\nstrongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed in a sombre yet\\r\\nrich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut\\r\\npearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of\\r\\nhis dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little\\r\\nsprings, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon\\r\\nhis legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and\\r\\nwrithed his face into the most extraordinary contortions.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What on earth can be the matter with him?” I asked. “He is\\r\\nlooking up at the numbers of the houses.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I believe that he is coming here,” said Holmes, rubbing his hands.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Here?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think\\r\\nthat I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?” As he spoke, the\\r\\nman, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the\\r\\nwhole house resounded with the clanging.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating, but\\r\\nwith so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were\\r\\nturned in an instant to horror and pity. For a while he could not get his words\\r\\nout, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven\\r\\nto the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he\\r\\nbeat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and\\r\\ntore him away to the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into\\r\\nthe easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in\\r\\nthe easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?” said he.\\r\\n“You are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered\\r\\nyourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which\\r\\nyou may submit to me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his\\r\\nemotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight, and\\r\\nturned his face towards us.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No doubt you think me mad?” said he.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I see that you have had some great trouble,” responded Holmes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“God knows I have!—a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason,\\r\\nso sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced, although I\\r\\nam a man whose character has never yet borne a stain. Private affliction also\\r\\nis the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful a\\r\\nform, have been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The\\r\\nvery noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this\\r\\nhorrible affair.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Pray compose yourself, sir,” said Holmes, “and let me have a\\r\\nclear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My name,” answered our visitor, “is probably familiar to\\r\\nyour ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder &\\r\\nStevenson, of Threadneedle Street.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the\\r\\nsecond largest private banking concern in the City of London. What could have\\r\\nhappened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most\\r\\npitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced\\r\\nhimself to tell his story.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I feel that time is of value,” said he; “that is why I\\r\\nhastened here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your\\r\\nco-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried from there\\r\\non foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is why I was so out of\\r\\nbreath, for I am a man who takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I\\r\\nwill put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking\\r\\nbusiness as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments\\r\\nfor our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our\\r\\ndepositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape\\r\\nof loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this\\r\\ndirection during the last few years, and there are many noble families to whom\\r\\nwe have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, or\\r\\nplate.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was\\r\\nbrought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it\\r\\nwas that of none other than—well, perhaps even to you I had better say no\\r\\nmore than that it was a name which is a household word all over the\\r\\nearth—one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I was\\r\\noverwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he\\r\\nplunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly\\r\\nthrough a disagreeable task.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Mr. Holder,’ said he, ‘I have been informed\\r\\nthat you are in the habit of advancing money.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘The firm does so when the security is good.’ I\\r\\nanswered.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘It is absolutely essential to me,’ said he, ‘that I\\r\\nshould have Â£ 50,000 at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten\\r\\ntimes over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business\\r\\nand to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily\\r\\nunderstand that it is unwise to place one’s self under obligations.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?’ I\\r\\nasked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then\\r\\nmost certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it\\r\\nright to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should be paid\\r\\nat once.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I should be happy to advance it without further parley from\\r\\nmy own private purse,’ said I, ‘were it not that the strain would\\r\\nbe rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the\\r\\nname of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that, even in\\r\\nyour case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I should much prefer to have it so,’ said he, raising\\r\\nup a square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. ‘You\\r\\nhave doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘One of the most precious public possessions of the\\r\\nempire,’ said I.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Precisely.’ He opened the case, and there, imbedded\\r\\nin soft, flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he\\r\\nhad named. ‘There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,’ said he,\\r\\n‘and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate\\r\\nwould put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am\\r\\nprepared to leave it with you as my security.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity\\r\\nfrom it to my illustrious client.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You doubt its value?’ he asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Not at all. I only doubt—’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at\\r\\nrest about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain\\r\\nthat I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter of form.\\r\\nIs the security sufficient?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Ample.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong\\r\\nproof of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard\\r\\nof you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip\\r\\nupon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with every possible\\r\\nprecaution because I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused\\r\\nif any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as serious as\\r\\nits complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to match these, and it\\r\\nwould be impossible to replace them. I leave it with you, however, with every\\r\\nconfidence, and I shall call for it in person on Monday morning.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but, calling\\r\\nfor my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty Â£ 1000 notes. When I was alone\\r\\nonce more, however, with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me,\\r\\nI could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which\\r\\nit entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it was a national\\r\\npossession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to\\r\\nit. I already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it. However, it\\r\\nwas too late to alter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and\\r\\nturned once more to my work.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so\\r\\nprecious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers’ safes had been forced\\r\\nbefore now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible would be the\\r\\nposition in which I should find myself! I determined, therefore, that for the\\r\\nnext few days I would always carry the case backward and forward with me, so\\r\\nthat it might never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a\\r\\ncab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did\\r\\nnot breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of\\r\\nmy dressing-room.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to\\r\\nthoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of the\\r\\nhouse, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants who have\\r\\nbeen with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above\\r\\nsuspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my\\r\\nservice a few months. She came with an excellent character, however, and has\\r\\nalways given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has attracted\\r\\nadmirers who have occasionally hung about the place. That is the only drawback\\r\\nwhich we have found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in\\r\\nevery way.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will not\\r\\ntake me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son, Arthur. He\\r\\nhas been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes—a grievous disappointment. I\\r\\nhave no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled\\r\\nhim. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to\\r\\nlove. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face. I\\r\\nhave never denied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better for both of us\\r\\nhad I been sterner, but I meant it for the best.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business,\\r\\nbut he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the\\r\\ntruth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money. When he\\r\\nwas young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having\\r\\ncharming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses\\r\\nand expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money\\r\\non the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give\\r\\nhim an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He\\r\\ntried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was\\r\\nkeeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was\\r\\nenough to draw him back again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell\\r\\nshould gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my\\r\\nhouse, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of\\r\\nhis manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one\\r\\nwho had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of\\r\\ngreat personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far away from the\\r\\nglamour of his presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look\\r\\nwhich I have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted.\\r\\nSo I think, and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman’s quick\\r\\ninsight into character.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when my\\r\\nbrother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her, and\\r\\nhave looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is a sunbeam in my\\r\\nhouse—sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet\\r\\nas tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do\\r\\nnot know what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone\\r\\nagainst my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her\\r\\ndevotedly, but each time she has refused him. I think that if anyone could have\\r\\ndrawn him into the right path it would have been she, and that his marriage\\r\\nmight have changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late—forever\\r\\ntoo late!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I shall\\r\\ncontinue with my miserable story.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after dinner,\\r\\nI told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious treasure which we had\\r\\nunder our roof, suppressing only the name of my client. Lucy Parr, who had\\r\\nbrought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that\\r\\nthe door was closed. Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the\\r\\nfamous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Where have you put it?’ asked Arthur.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘In my own bureau.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Well, I hope to goodness the house won’t be burgled\\r\\nduring the night.’ said he.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘It is locked up,’ I answered.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a\\r\\nyoungster I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what he\\r\\nsaid. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very grave face.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Look here, dad,’ said he with his eyes cast down,\\r\\n‘can you let me have Â£ 200?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘No, I cannot!’ I answered sharply. ‘I have been\\r\\nfar too generous with you in money matters.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You have been very kind,’ said he, ‘but I must\\r\\nhave this money, or else I can never show my face inside the club again.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘And a very good thing, too!’ I cried.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured\\r\\nman,’ said he. ‘I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the\\r\\nmoney in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try other\\r\\nmeans.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month.\\r\\n‘You shall not have a farthing from me,’ I cried, on which he bowed\\r\\nand left the room without another word.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was\\r\\nsafe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see that all\\r\\nwas secure—a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I thought it\\r\\nwell to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself\\r\\nat the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Tell me, dad,’ said she, looking, I thought, a little\\r\\ndisturbed, ‘did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Certainly not.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that\\r\\nshe has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that it is\\r\\nhardly safe and should be stopped.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you\\r\\nprefer it. Are you sure that everything is fastened?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Quite sure, dad.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Then, good-night.’ I kissed her and went up to my\\r\\nbedroom again, where I was soon asleep.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have any\\r\\nbearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any point which\\r\\nI do not make clear.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be\\r\\nparticularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind\\r\\ntended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in the morning,\\r\\nthen, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had ceased ere I was wide\\r\\nawake, but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently\\r\\nclosed somewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my horror,\\r\\nthere was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room. I\\r\\nslipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of\\r\\nmy dressing-room door.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Arthur!’ I screamed, ‘you villain! you thief!\\r\\nHow dare you touch that coronet?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed only\\r\\nin his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding the coronet\\r\\nin his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with all his\\r\\nstrength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I\\r\\nsnatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with three of the\\r\\nberyls in it, was missing.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You blackguard!’ I shouted, beside myself with rage.\\r\\n‘You have destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the\\r\\njewels which you have stolen?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Stolen!’ he cried.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Yes, thief!’ I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,’\\r\\nsaid he.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must\\r\\nI call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off\\r\\nanother piece?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You have called me names enough,’ said he, ‘I\\r\\nwill not stand it any longer. I shall not say another word about this business,\\r\\nsince you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and\\r\\nmake my own way in the world.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You shall leave it in the hands of the police!’ I\\r\\ncried half-mad with grief and rage. ‘I shall have this matter probed to\\r\\nthe bottom.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You shall learn nothing from me,’ said he with a\\r\\npassion such as I should not have thought was in his nature. ‘If you\\r\\nchoose to call the police, let the police find what they can.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in my\\r\\nanger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of the\\r\\ncoronet and of Arthur’s face, she read the whole story and, with a\\r\\nscream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the housemaid for the police\\r\\nand put the investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a\\r\\nconstable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms\\r\\nfolded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft. I\\r\\nanswered that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become a public\\r\\none, since the ruined coronet was national property. I was determined that the\\r\\nlaw should have its way in everything.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘At least,’ said he, ‘you will not have me\\r\\narrested at once. It would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might\\r\\nleave the house for five minutes.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what\\r\\nyou have stolen,’ said I. And then, realising the dreadful position in\\r\\nwhich I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that\\r\\nof one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened to raise\\r\\na scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would\\r\\nbut tell me what he had done with the three missing stones.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You may as well face the matter,’ said I; ‘you\\r\\nhave been caught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more\\r\\nheinous. If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us\\r\\nwhere the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,’ he\\r\\nanswered, turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for\\r\\nany words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in\\r\\nthe inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only of\\r\\nhis person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could\\r\\npossibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor\\r\\nwould the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats.\\r\\nThis morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after going through all the\\r\\npolice formalities, have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill\\r\\nin unravelling the matter. The police have openly confessed that they can at\\r\\npresent make nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think\\r\\nnecessary. I have already offered a reward of Â£ 1000. My God, what shall I do!\\r\\nI have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I\\r\\ndo!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro, droning\\r\\nto himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted and his\\r\\neyes fixed upon the fire.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do you receive much company?” he asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of\\r\\nArthur’s. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one else,\\r\\nI think.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do you go out much in society?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for\\r\\nit.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is unusual in a young girl.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is\\r\\nfour-and-twenty.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her\\r\\nalso.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Terrible! She is even more affected than I.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You have neither of you any doubt as to your son’s guilt?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his\\r\\nhands.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the\\r\\ncoronet at all injured?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, it was twisted.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten\\r\\nit?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it is\\r\\ntoo heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose were innocent,\\r\\nwhy did he not say so?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His\\r\\nsilence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular points about\\r\\nthe case. What did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your\\r\\nsleep?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They considered that it might be caused by Arthur’s closing his\\r\\nbedroom door.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to\\r\\nwake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of these\\r\\ngems?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the\\r\\nhope of finding them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Have they thought of looking outside the house?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has already\\r\\nbeen minutely examined.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now, my dear sir,” said Holmes, “is it not obvious to you\\r\\nnow that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the\\r\\npolice were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a simple case;\\r\\nto me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is involved by your theory.\\r\\nYou suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your\\r\\ndressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main\\r\\nforce a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems\\r\\nout of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then\\r\\nreturned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to\\r\\nthe greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory\\r\\ntenable?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But what other is there?” cried the banker with a gesture of\\r\\ndespair. “If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain\\r\\nthem?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is our task to find that out,” replied Holmes; “so now,\\r\\nif you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote\\r\\nan hour to glancing a little more closely into details.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which I was\\r\\neager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the\\r\\nstory to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt of the banker’s\\r\\nson appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still\\r\\nI had such faith in Holmes’ judgment that I felt that there must be some\\r\\ngrounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation.\\r\\nHe hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with\\r\\nhis chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest\\r\\nthought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of\\r\\nhope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat\\r\\nwith me over his business affairs. A short railway journey and a shorter walk\\r\\nbrought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little\\r\\nfrom the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down\\r\\nin front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance. On the right side\\r\\nwas a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat\\r\\nhedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the\\r\\ntradesmen’s entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the stables,\\r\\nand was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little\\r\\nused, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all\\r\\nround the house, across the front, down the tradesmen’s path, and so\\r\\nround by the garden behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder\\r\\nand I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return.\\r\\nWe were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in.\\r\\nShe was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which\\r\\nseemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that\\r\\nI have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman’s face. Her lips, too,\\r\\nwere bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept silently\\r\\ninto the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker\\r\\nhad done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was\\r\\nevidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for\\r\\nself-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and\\r\\npassed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not,\\r\\ndad?” she asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman’s\\r\\ninstincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for\\r\\nhaving acted so harshly.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect\\r\\nhim.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the\\r\\ncoronet in his hand?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word\\r\\nfor it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is so\\r\\ndreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I shall never let it drop until the gems are found—never, Mary!\\r\\nYour affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far\\r\\nfrom hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London to\\r\\ninquire more deeply into it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This gentleman?” she asked, facing round to me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the\\r\\nstable lane now.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The stable lane?” She raised her dark eyebrows. “What can he\\r\\nhope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will\\r\\nsucceed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is\\r\\ninnocent of this crime.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove\\r\\nit,” returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his\\r\\nshoes. “I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder. Might\\r\\nI ask you a question or two?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You heard nothing yourself last night?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and I\\r\\ncame down.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all\\r\\nthe windows?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Were they all fastened this morning?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to your\\r\\nuncle last night that she had been out to see him?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may\\r\\nhave heard uncle’s remarks about the coronet.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and\\r\\nthat the two may have planned the robbery.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But what is the good of all these vague theories,” cried the\\r\\nbanker impatiently, “when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the\\r\\ncoronet in his hands?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl,\\r\\nMiss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her\\r\\nslipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do you know him?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes! he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round. His\\r\\nname is Francis Prosper.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He stood,” said Holmes, “to the left of the door—that\\r\\nis to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, he did.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And he is a man with a wooden leg?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSomething like fear sprang up in the young lady’s expressive black eyes.\\r\\n“Why, you are like a magician,” said she. “How do you know\\r\\nthat?” She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes’\\r\\nthin, eager face.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I should be very glad now to go upstairs,” said he. “I shall\\r\\nprobably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better\\r\\ntake a look at the lower windows before I go up.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large one\\r\\nwhich looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he opened and made a very\\r\\ncareful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens. “Now\\r\\nwe shall go upstairs,” said he at last.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe banker’s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with a\\r\\ngrey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the bureau first\\r\\nand looked hard at the lock.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Which key was used to open it?” he asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That which my son himself indicated—that of the cupboard of the\\r\\nlumber-room.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Have you it here?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is it on the dressing-table.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is a noiseless lock,” said he. “It is no wonder that it\\r\\ndid not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a\\r\\nlook at it.” He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it\\r\\nupon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller’s art, and\\r\\nthe thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one side of the\\r\\ncoronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now, Mr. Holder,” said Holmes, “here is the corner which\\r\\ncorresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you\\r\\nwill break it off.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe banker recoiled in horror. “I should not dream of trying,” said\\r\\nhe.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I will.” Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but\\r\\nwithout result. “I feel it give a little,” said he; “but,\\r\\nthough I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time\\r\\nto break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would\\r\\nhappen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a pistol\\r\\nshot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and\\r\\nthat you heard nothing of it?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss\\r\\nHolder?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I confess that I still share my uncle’s perplexity.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck\\r\\nduring this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed\\r\\nin clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now\\r\\ncontinue my investigations outside.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary\\r\\nfootmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour or more he was at\\r\\nwork, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as\\r\\ninscrutable as ever.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr.\\r\\nHolder,” said he; “I can serve you best by returning to my\\r\\nrooms.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I cannot tell.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe banker wrung his hands. “I shall never see them again!” he\\r\\ncried. “And my son? You give me hopes?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My opinion is in no way altered.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then, for God’s sake, what was this dark business which was acted\\r\\nin my house last night?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning\\r\\nbetween nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer. I\\r\\nunderstand that you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only\\r\\nthat I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may\\r\\ndraw.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I would give my fortune to have them back.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then. Good-bye;\\r\\nit is just possible that I may have to come over here again before\\r\\nevening.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was obvious to me that my companion’s mind was now made up about the\\r\\ncase, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly\\r\\nimagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him\\r\\nupon the point, but he always glided away to some other topic, until at last I\\r\\ngave it over in despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our\\r\\nrooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes\\r\\ndressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat,\\r\\nhis red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I think that this should do,” said he, glancing into the glass\\r\\nabove the fireplace. “I only wish that you could come with me, Watson,\\r\\nbut I fear that it won’t do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I\\r\\nmay be following a will-o’-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I\\r\\nhope that I may be back in a few hours.” He cut a slice of beef from the\\r\\njoint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and\\r\\nthrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent spirits,\\r\\nswinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it down into a\\r\\ncorner and helped himself to a cup of tea.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I only looked in as I passed,” said he. “I am going right\\r\\non.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Where to?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I get\\r\\nback. Don’t wait up for me in case I should be late.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How are you getting on?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since I\\r\\nsaw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet little\\r\\nproblem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal. However, I must not\\r\\nsit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to\\r\\nmy highly respectable self.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than\\r\\nhis words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch of\\r\\ncolour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I\\r\\nheard the slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon\\r\\nhis congenial hunt.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I retired to\\r\\nmy room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end\\r\\nwhen he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise. I do\\r\\nnot know at what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the\\r\\nmorning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the\\r\\nother, as fresh and trim as possible.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,” said he,\\r\\n“but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this\\r\\nmorning.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, it is after nine now,” I answered. “I should not be\\r\\nsurprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change which had\\r\\ncome over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould,\\r\\nwas now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a shade\\r\\nwhiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful\\r\\nthan his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into the\\r\\narmchair which I pushed forward for him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,” said he.\\r\\n“Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in\\r\\nthe world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow comes\\r\\nclose upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Deserted you?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and\\r\\na note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last night, in sorrow\\r\\nand not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have been well with\\r\\nhim. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she\\r\\nrefers in this note:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘MY DEAREST UNCLE,—I feel that I have brought trouble\\r\\nupon you, and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might\\r\\nnever have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever again be\\r\\nhappy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you forever. Do not worry\\r\\nabout my future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search for\\r\\nme, for it will be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in\\r\\ndeath, I am ever your loving,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘MARY.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points to\\r\\nsuicide?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution. I\\r\\ntrust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned\\r\\nsomething! Where are the gems?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You would not think Â£ 1000 apiece an excessive sum for\\r\\nthem?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I would pay ten.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And\\r\\nthere is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your cheque-book? Here is a pen.\\r\\nBetter make it out for Â£ 4000.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes walked over to\\r\\nhis desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it, and\\r\\nthrew it down upon the table.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You have it!” he gasped. “I am saved! I am saved!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he hugged his\\r\\nrecovered gems to his bosom.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,” said Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes rather sternly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Owe!” He caught up a pen. “Name the sum, and I will pay\\r\\nit.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble\\r\\nlad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to\\r\\nsee my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then it was not Arthur who took them?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know\\r\\nthat the truth is known.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview\\r\\nwith him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to him, on\\r\\nwhich he had to confess that I was right and to add the very few details which\\r\\nwere not yet quite clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open\\r\\nhis lips.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“For Heaven’s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary\\r\\nmystery!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. And\\r\\nlet me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to\\r\\nhear: there has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell and your\\r\\nniece Mary. They have now fled together.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My Mary? Impossible!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor\\r\\nyour son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your\\r\\nfamily circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in England—a ruined\\r\\ngambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience.\\r\\nYour niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he\\r\\nhad done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she alone had\\r\\ntouched his heart. The devil knows best what he said, but at least she became\\r\\nhis tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I cannot, and I will not, believe it!” cried the banker with an\\r\\nashen face.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your\\r\\nniece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down and talked\\r\\nto her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane. His footmarks\\r\\nhad pressed right through the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of\\r\\nthe coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to\\r\\nhis will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the\\r\\nlove of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have\\r\\nbeen one. She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming\\r\\ndownstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of\\r\\nthe servants’ escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all\\r\\nperfectly true.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he slept\\r\\nbadly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. In the middle of the\\r\\nnight he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose and, looking out, was\\r\\nsurprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she\\r\\ndisappeared into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad\\r\\nslipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of\\r\\nthis strange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the\\r\\nlight of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in\\r\\nher hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along\\r\\nand slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see what passed\\r\\nin the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the\\r\\ncoronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to\\r\\nher room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a\\r\\nhorrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she was gone\\r\\nhe realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and how\\r\\nall-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his\\r\\nbare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane,\\r\\nwhere he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to\\r\\nget away, but Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle between them, your\\r\\nlad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the\\r\\nscuffle, your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something\\r\\nsuddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his hands,\\r\\nrushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed\\r\\nthat the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to\\r\\nstraighten it when you appeared upon the scene.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Is it possible?” gasped the banker.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt\\r\\nthat he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the true state\\r\\nof affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough\\r\\nconsideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous view, however, and\\r\\npreserved her secret.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the\\r\\ncoronet,” cried Mr. Holder. “Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have\\r\\nbeen! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow\\r\\nwanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How\\r\\ncruelly I have misjudged him!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When I arrived at the house,” continued Holmes, “I at once\\r\\nwent very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow\\r\\nwhich might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and\\r\\nalso that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. I passed along\\r\\nthe tradesmen’s path, but found it all trampled down and\\r\\nindistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen\\r\\ndoor, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one\\r\\nside showed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been\\r\\ndisturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the\\r\\ndeep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then\\r\\nhad gone away. I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her\\r\\nsweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so.\\r\\nI passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks,\\r\\nwhich I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very long\\r\\nand complex story was written in the snow in front of me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double\\r\\nline which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was at once\\r\\nconvinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. The first had\\r\\nwalked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in\\r\\nplaces over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after\\r\\nthe other. I followed them up and found they led to the hall window, where\\r\\nBoots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end,\\r\\nwhich was a hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced\\r\\nround, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and,\\r\\nfinally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not\\r\\nmistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood\\r\\nshowed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the high road at the\\r\\nother end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to\\r\\nthat clue.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill\\r\\nand framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see that\\r\\nsomeone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an instep where the\\r\\nwet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form\\r\\nan opinion as to what had occurred. A man had waited outside the window;\\r\\nsomeone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had\\r\\npursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet,\\r\\ntheir united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected.\\r\\nHe had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his\\r\\nopponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man, and who was\\r\\nit brought him the coronet?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible,\\r\\nwhatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew that it\\r\\nwas not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece and the\\r\\nmaids. But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be\\r\\naccused in their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his\\r\\ncousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her\\r\\nsecret—the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. When I remembered\\r\\nthat you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the\\r\\ncoronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for who\\r\\nelse could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? I knew\\r\\nthat you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very limited\\r\\none. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being\\r\\na man of evil reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots\\r\\nand retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered\\r\\nhim, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say\\r\\na word without compromising his own family.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I went\\r\\nin the shape of a loafer to Sir George’s house, managed to pick up an\\r\\nacquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his head the night\\r\\nbefore, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying\\r\\na pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and saw\\r\\nthat they exactly fitted the tracks.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,” said\\r\\nMr. Holder.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and\\r\\nchanged my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then, for I saw\\r\\nthat a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I knew that so astute\\r\\na villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him.\\r\\nAt first, of course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every particular\\r\\nthat had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the\\r\\nwall. I knew my man, however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he\\r\\ncould strike. Then he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would\\r\\ngive him a price for the stones he held—Â£ 1000 apiece. That brought out\\r\\nthe first signs of grief that he had shown. ‘Why, dash it all!’\\r\\nsaid he, ‘I’ve let them go at six hundred for the three!’ I\\r\\nsoon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him\\r\\nthat there would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering\\r\\nI got our stones at Â£ 1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him\\r\\nthat all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o’clock, after\\r\\nwhat I may call a really hard day’s work.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A day which has saved England from a great public scandal,” said\\r\\nthe banker, rising. “Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall\\r\\nnot find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed exceeded\\r\\nall that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy to apologise to\\r\\nhim for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary,\\r\\nit goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is\\r\\nnow.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I think that we may safely say,” returned Holmes, “that she\\r\\nis wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that whatever\\r\\nher sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment.”\\r\\n'], 'metadata': {'author': ['Arthur Conan Doyle', 'Arthur Conan Doyle'], 'year': tensor([1891, 1891]), 'url': ['https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1661/1661-h/1661-h.htm', 'https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1661/1661-h/1661-h.htm'], 'name': ['blue_carbuncle', 'beryl_coronet']}}\n"
