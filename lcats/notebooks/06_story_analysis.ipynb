       "[{'name': \"Sherlock Holmes - The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb\",\n",
       "  'body': '\\nOf all the problems\\nwhich have been submitted to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for solution\\nduring the years of our intimacy, there were only two which I was the means of\\nintroducing to his notice—that of Mr. Hatherley’s thumb, and that\\nof Colonel Warburton’s madness. Of these the latter may have afforded a\\nfiner field for an acute and original observer, but the other was so strange in\\nits inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of\\nbeing placed upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those\\ndeductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results.\\nThe story has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but, like\\nall such narratives, its effect is much less striking when set forth en\\nbloc in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly evolve\\nbefore your own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually away as each new\\ndiscovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth. At the time\\nthe circumstances made a deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years\\nhas hardly served to weaken the effect.\\n\\n\\nIt was in the summer of ’89, not long after my marriage, that the events\\noccurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned to civil practice\\nand had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms, although I\\ncontinually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his\\nBohemian habits so far as to come and visit us. My practice had steadily\\nincreased, and as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington\\nStation, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of these, whom I\\nhad cured of a painful and lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my\\nvirtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might\\nhave any influence.\\n\\n\\nOne morning, at a little before seven o’clock, I was awakened by the maid\\ntapping at the door to announce that two men had come from Paddington and were\\nwaiting in the consulting-room. I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience\\nthat railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I\\ndescended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door\\ntightly behind him.\\n\\n\\n“I’ve got him here,” he whispered, jerking his thumb over his\\nshoulder; “he’s all right.”\\n\\n\\n“What is it, then?” I asked, for his manner suggested that it was\\nsome strange creature which he had caged up in my room.\\n\\n\\n“It’s a new patient,” he whispered. “I thought\\nI’d bring him round myself; then he couldn’t slip away. There he\\nis, all safe and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same\\nas you.” And off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time\\nto thank him.\\n\\n\\nI entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table. He was\\nquietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had\\nlaid down upon my books. Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped,\\nwhich was mottled all over with bloodstains. He was young, not more than\\nfive-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was\\nexceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from\\nsome strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.\\n\\n\\n“I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,” said he, “but\\nI have had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by train this\\nmorning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor, a\\nworthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a card, but I see\\nthat she has left it upon the side-table.”\\n\\n\\nI took it up and glanced at it. “Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic\\nengineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor).” That was the name, style,\\nand abode of my morning visitor. “I regret that I have kept you\\nwaiting,” said I, sitting down in my library-chair. “You are fresh\\nfrom a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous\\noccupation.”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, my night could not be called monotonous,” said he, and\\nlaughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in\\nhis chair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against that\\nlaugh.\\n\\n\\n“Stop it!” I cried; “pull yourself together!” and I\\npoured out some water from a caraffe.\\n\\n\\nIt was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which\\ncome upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone. Presently he\\ncame to himself once more, very weary and pale-looking.\\n\\n\\n“I have been making a fool of myself,” he gasped.\\n\\n\\n“Not at all. Drink this.” I dashed some brandy into the water, and\\nthe colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.\\n\\n\\n“That’s better!” said he. “And now, Doctor, perhaps you\\nwould kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to\\nbe.”\\n\\n\\nHe unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my hardened\\nnerves a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding fingers and a horrid\\nred, spongy surface where the thumb should have been. It had been hacked or\\ntorn right out from the roots.\\n\\n\\n“Good heavens!” I cried, “this is a terrible injury. It must\\nhave bled considerably.”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have\\nbeen senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that it was still\\nbleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and\\nbraced it up with a twig.”\\n\\n\\n“Excellent! You should have been a surgeon.”\\n\\n\\n“It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own\\nprovince.”\\n\\n\\n“This has been done,” said I, examining the wound, “by a very\\nheavy and sharp instrument.”\\n\\n\\n“A thing like a cleaver,” said he.\\n\\n\\n“An accident, I presume?”\\n\\n\\n“By no means.”\\n\\n\\n“What! a murderous attack?”\\n\\n\\n“Very murderous indeed.”\\n\\n\\n“You horrify me.”\\n\\n\\nI sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it over with\\ncotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back without wincing, though he\\nbit his lip from time to time.\\n\\n\\n“How is that?” I asked when I had finished.\\n\\n\\n“Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man. I was\\nvery weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.”\\n\\n\\n“Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying\\nto your nerves.”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but,\\nbetween ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of\\nmine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement, for it is a very\\nextraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof with which to back\\nit up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are so\\nvague that it is a question whether justice will be done.”\\n\\n\\n“Ha!” cried I, “if it is anything in the nature of a problem\\nwhich you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my\\nfriend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the official police.”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, I have heard of that fellow,” answered my visitor, “and\\nI should be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must\\nuse the official police as well. Would you give me an introduction to\\nhim?”\\n\\n\\n“I’ll do better. I’ll take you round to him myself.”\\n\\n\\n“I should be immensely obliged to you.”\\n\\n\\n“We’ll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to have\\na little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.”\\n\\n\\n“Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an\\ninstant.” I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife, and\\nin five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new acquaintance to Baker\\nStreet.\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in his\\ndressing-gown, reading the agony column of The Times and smoking his\\nbefore-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left\\nfrom his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and collected on the\\ncorner of the mantelpiece. He received us in his quietly genial fashion,\\nordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal. When it was\\nconcluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa, placed a pillow\\nbeneath his head, and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach.\\n\\n\\n“It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr.\\nHatherley,” said he. “Pray, lie down there and make yourself\\nabsolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep\\nup your strength with a little stimulant.”\\n\\n\\n“Thank you,” said my patient, “but I have felt another man\\nsince the doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the\\ncure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I shall\\nstart at once upon my peculiar experiences.”\\n\\n\\nHolmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression which\\nveiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him, and we listened\\nin silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us.\\n\\n\\n“You must know,” said he, “that I am an orphan and a\\nbachelor, residing alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a hydraulic\\nengineer, and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven\\nyears that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, of\\nGreenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having also come into a\\nfair sum of money through my poor father’s death, I determined to start\\nin business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria Street.\\n\\n\\n“I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a\\ndreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two years I have\\nhad three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all that my\\nprofession has brought me. My gross takings amount to Â£ 27 10s. Every\\nday, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my\\nlittle den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to believe that I\\nshould never have any practice at all.\\n\\n\\n“Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my\\nclerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon\\nbusiness. He brought up a card, too, with the name of ‘Colonel Lysander\\nStark’ engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel himself, a\\nman rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think\\nthat I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose\\nand chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding\\nbones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no\\ndisease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He\\nwas plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer\\nforty than thirty.\\n\\n\\n“‘Mr. Hatherley?’ said he, with something of a German\\naccent. ‘You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man\\nwho is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable\\nof preserving a secret.’\\n\\n\\n“I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address.\\n‘May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?’\\n\\n\\n“‘Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that\\njust at this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan\\nand a bachelor and are residing alone in London.’\\n\\n\\n“‘That is quite correct,’ I answered; ‘but you\\nwill excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my\\nprofessional qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter\\nthat you wished to speak to me?’\\n\\n\\n“‘Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really\\nto the point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy is\\nquite essential—absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we may\\nexpect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom\\nof his family.’\\n\\n\\n“‘If I promise to keep a secret,’ said I, ‘you\\nmay absolutely depend upon my doing so.’\\n\\n\\n“He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had\\nnever seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.\\n\\n\\n“‘Do you promise, then?’ said he at last.\\n\\n\\n“‘Yes, I promise.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No\\nreference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?’\\n\\n\\n“‘I have already given you my word.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Very good.’ He suddenly sprang up, and darting like\\nlightning across the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was\\nempty.\\n\\n\\n“‘That’s all right,’ said he, coming back.\\n‘I know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master’s\\naffairs. Now we can talk in safety.’ He drew up his chair very close to\\nmine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful\\nlook.\\n\\n\\n“A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to rise\\nwithin me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. Even my dread of losing\\na client could not restrain me from showing my impatience.\\n\\n\\n“‘I beg that you will state your business, sir,’ said\\nI; ‘my time is of value.’ Heaven forgive me for that last sentence,\\nbut the words came to my lips.\\n\\n\\n“‘How would fifty guineas for a night’s work suit\\nyou?’ he asked.\\n\\n\\n“‘Most admirably.’\\n\\n\\n“‘I say a night’s work, but an hour’s would be\\nnearer the mark. I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine\\nwhich has got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it\\nright ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as that?’\\n\\n\\n“‘The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the\\nlast train.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Where to?’\\n\\n\\n“‘To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the\\nborders of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a train\\nfrom Paddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Very good.’\\n\\n\\n“‘I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.’\\n\\n\\n“‘There is a drive, then?’\\n\\n\\n“‘Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a\\ngood seven miles from Eyford Station.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose\\nthere would be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop the\\nnight.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.’\\n\\n\\n“‘That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more\\nconvenient hour?’\\n\\n\\n“‘We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to\\nrecompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and\\nunknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your\\nprofession. Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the business,\\nthere is plenty of time to do so.’\\n\\n\\n“I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be to\\nme. ‘Not at all,’ said I, ‘I shall be very happy to\\naccommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to understand a\\nlittle more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy\\nwhich we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I have no\\nwish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. I\\nsuppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?’\\n\\n\\n“‘Entirely.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that\\nfuller’s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one or\\ntwo places in England?’\\n\\n\\n“‘I have heard so.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Some little time ago I bought a small place—a very\\nsmall place—within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to\\ndiscover that there was a deposit of fuller’s-earth in one of my fields.\\nOn examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small\\none, and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right\\nand left—both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These\\ngood people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was\\nquite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my interest to buy their\\nland before they discovered its true value, but unfortunately I had no capital\\nby which I could do this. I took a few of my friends into the secret, however,\\nand they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little\\ndeposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to\\nbuy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been doing for some time, and in\\norder to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This press, as\\nI have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon\\nthe subject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it once became\\nknown that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house, it would soon\\nrouse inquiry, and then, if the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any\\nchance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have\\nmade you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to\\nEyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?’\\n\\n\\n“‘I quite follow you,’ said I. ‘The only point\\nwhich I could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic\\npress in excavating fuller’s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out\\nlike gravel from a pit.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Ah!’ said he carelessly, ‘we have our own\\nprocess. We compress the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without\\nrevealing what they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into\\nmy confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.’\\nHe rose as he spoke. ‘I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at\\n11:15.’\\n\\n\\n“‘I shall certainly be there.’\\n\\n\\n“‘And not a word to a soul.’ He looked at me with a\\nlast long, questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp,\\nhe hurried from the room.\\n\\n\\n“Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much\\nastonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had been\\nintrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the fee was at\\nleast tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price upon my own services,\\nand it was possible that this order might lead to other ones. On the other\\nhand, the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon\\nme, and I could not think that his explanation of the fuller’s-earth was\\nsufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme\\nanxiety lest I should tell anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to\\nthe winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off, having\\nobeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.\\n\\n\\n“At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station. However,\\nI was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the little dim-lit\\nstation after eleven o’clock. I was the only passenger who got out there,\\nand there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a\\nlantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate, however, I found my\\nacquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without\\na word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door of which was\\nstanding open. He drew up the windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work,\\nand away we went as fast as the horse could go.”\\n\\n\\n“One horse?” interjected Holmes.\\n\\n\\n“Yes, only one.”\\n\\n\\n“Did you observe the colour?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the carriage.\\nIt was a chestnut.”\\n\\n\\n“Tired-looking or fresh?”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, fresh and glossy.”\\n\\n\\n“Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most\\ninteresting statement.”\\n\\n\\n“Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander\\nStark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from the rate\\nthat we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it must have been\\nnearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more\\nthan once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me with great\\nintensity. The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the\\nworld, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows\\nto see something of where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I\\ncould make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now\\nand then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but the\\ncolonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon flagged. At\\nlast, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness\\nof a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark\\nsprang out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which\\ngaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and\\ninto the hall, so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front\\nof the house. The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed\\nheavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage\\ndrove away.\\n\\n\\n“It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about\\nlooking for matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door opened at\\nthe other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light shot out in our\\ndirection. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which\\nshe held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us. I could\\nsee that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her\\ndark dress I knew that it was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a\\nforeign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and when my companion\\nanswered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly\\nfell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her\\near, and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he\\nwalked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.\\n\\n\\n“‘Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for\\na few minutes,’ said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet,\\nlittle, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which\\nseveral German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the\\ntop of a harmonium beside the door. ‘I shall not keep you waiting an\\ninstant,’ said he, and vanished into the darkness.\\n\\n\\n“I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of\\nGerman I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the others being\\nvolumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window, hoping that I might\\ncatch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was\\nfolded across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old clock\\nticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise everything was deadly\\nstill. A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these\\nGerman people, and what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way\\nplace? And where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all\\nI knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that matter,\\nReading, and possibly other large towns, were within that radius, so the place\\nmight not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was quite certain, from the\\nabsolute stillness, that we were in the country. I paced up and down the room,\\nhumming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was\\nthoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.\\n\\n\\n“Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter\\nstillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was standing in the\\naperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp\\nbeating upon her eager and beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was\\nsick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one\\nshaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words of\\nbroken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse,\\ninto the gloom behind her.\\n\\n\\n“‘I would go,’ said she, trying hard, as it seemed to\\nme, to speak calmly; ‘I would go. I should not stay here. There is no\\ngood for you to do.’\\n\\n\\n“‘But, madam,’ said I, ‘I have not yet done what\\nI came for. I cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.’\\n\\n\\n“‘It is not worth your while to wait,’ she went on.\\n‘You can pass through the door; no one hinders.’ And then, seeing\\nthat I smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and\\nmade a step forward, with her hands wrung together. ‘For the love of\\nHeaven!’ she whispered, ‘get away from here before it is too\\nlate!’\\n\\n\\n“But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage in\\nan affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my fifty-guinea\\nfee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be\\nbefore me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having\\ncarried out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This woman\\nmight, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though\\nher manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head\\nand declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew her\\nentreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps was\\nheard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up her hands with a\\ndespairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had\\ncome.\\n\\n\\n“The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a\\nchinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was\\nintroduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.\\n\\n\\n“‘This is my secretary and manager,’ said the colonel.\\n‘By the way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just\\nnow. I fear that you have felt the draught.’\\n\\n\\n“‘On the contrary,’ said I, ‘I opened the door\\nmyself because I felt the room to be a little close.’\\n\\n\\n“He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. ‘Perhaps we had better\\nproceed to business, then,’ said he. ‘Mr. Ferguson and I will take\\nyou up to see the machine.’\\n\\n\\n“‘I had better put my hat on, I suppose.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Oh, no, it is in the house.’\\n\\n\\n“‘What, you dig fuller’s-earth in the house?’\\n\\n\\n“‘No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind\\nthat. All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what\\nis wrong with it.’\\n\\n\\n“We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat\\nmanager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with corridors,\\npassages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the thresholds of\\nwhich were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them. There were no\\ncarpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster\\nwas peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in green,\\nunhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I\\nhad not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and\\nI kept a keen eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and\\nsilent man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least a\\nfellow-countryman.\\n\\n\\n“Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he\\nunlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us could\\nhardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the colonel ushered me\\nin.\\n\\n\\n“‘We are now,’ said he, ‘actually within the\\nhydraulic press, and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if\\nanyone were to turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end\\nof the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon\\nthis metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside which\\nreceive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is\\nfamiliar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness\\nin the working of it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will\\nhave the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it\\nright.’\\n\\n\\n“I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly. It\\nwas indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous pressure. When I\\npassed outside, however, and pressed down the levers which controlled it, I\\nknew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which\\nallowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An\\nexamination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was round the head\\nof a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it\\nworked. This was clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out\\nto my companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several\\npractical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I had\\nmade it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a\\ngood look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was obvious at a glance that\\nthe story of the fuller’s-earth was the merest fabrication, for it would\\nbe absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so\\ninadequate a purpose. The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a\\nlarge iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a crust of\\nmetallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was scraping at this to see\\nexactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the\\ncadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me.\\n\\n\\n“‘What are you doing there?’ he asked.\\n\\n\\n“I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that\\nwhich he had told me. ‘I was admiring your fuller’s-earth,’\\nsaid I; ‘I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your\\nmachine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.’\\n\\n\\n“The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my\\nspeech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes.\\n\\n\\n“‘Very well,’ said he, ‘you shall know all about\\nthe machine.’ He took a step backward, slammed the little door, and\\nturned the key in the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but\\nit was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves.\\n‘Hullo!’ I yelled. ‘Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!’\\n\\n\\n“And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart\\ninto my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking\\ncylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood upon the floor\\nwhere I had placed it when examining the trough. By its light I saw that the\\nblack ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew\\nbetter than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a\\nshapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged with\\nmy nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless\\nclanking of the levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two\\nabove my head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface.\\nThen it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very\\nmuch upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the weight would\\ncome upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap. Easier the\\nother way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly\\nblack shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand erect, when\\nmy eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart.\\n\\n\\n“I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls\\nwere of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line of\\nyellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and broadened as a\\nsmall panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could hardly believe that\\nhere was indeed a door which led away from death. The next instant I threw\\nmyself through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had closed\\nagain behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few moments afterwards the\\nclang of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had been my escape.\\n\\n\\n“I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I found\\nmyself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent over\\nme and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a candle in her right.\\nIt was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.\\n\\n\\n“‘Come! come!’ she cried breathlessly. ‘They will\\nbe here in a moment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the\\nso-precious time, but come!’\\n\\n\\n“This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my feet\\nand ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The latter led to\\nanother broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running\\nfeet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other from the floor on\\nwhich  we were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about her\\nlike one  who is at her wit’s end. Then she threw open a door which led\\ninto a bedroom, through the window of which the moon was shining brightly.\\n\\n\\n“‘It is your only chance,’ said she. ‘It is high,\\nbut it may be that you can jump it.’\\n\\n\\n“As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage,\\nand I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a\\nlantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher’s cleaver in the other. I\\nrushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and\\nsweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be\\nmore than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to\\njump until I should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian\\nwho pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to go\\nback to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before\\nhe was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round him\\nand tried to hold him back.\\n\\n\\n“‘Fritz! Fritz!’ she cried in English, ‘remember\\nyour promise after the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be\\nsilent! Oh, he will be silent!’\\n\\n\\n“‘You are mad, Elise!’ he shouted, struggling to break\\naway from her. ‘You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me\\npass, I say!’ He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut\\nat me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands\\nto the sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip\\nloosened, and I fell into the garden below.\\n\\n\\n“I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and rushed\\noff among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood that I was far\\nfrom being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness\\nand sickness came over me. I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing\\npainfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and\\nthat the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief\\nround it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in\\na dead faint among the rose-bushes.\\n\\n\\n“How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been a very\\nlong time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was breaking when I came\\nto myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched\\nwith blood from my wounded thumb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all\\nthe particulars of my night’s adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the\\nfeeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But to my\\nastonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house nor garden were to be\\nseen. I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the high road, and just\\na little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it,\\nto be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. Were it\\nnot for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dreadful\\nhours might have been an evil dream.\\n\\n\\n“Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train.\\nThere would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was on\\nduty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him whether he\\nhad ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he\\nobserved a carriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was there\\na police-station anywhere near? There was one about three miles off.\\n\\n\\n“It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to wait\\nuntil I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It was a little\\npast six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound dressed, and then the\\ndoctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I put the case into your hands\\nand shall do exactly what you advise.”\\n\\n\\nWe both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this\\nextraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of\\nthe ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings.\\n\\n\\n“Here is an advertisement which will interest you,” said he.\\n“It appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this:\\n‘Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a\\nhydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o’clock at night, and has\\nnot been heard of since. Was dressed in,’ etc., etc. Ha! That represents\\nthe last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I\\nfancy.”\\n\\n\\n“Good heavens!” cried my patient. “Then that explains what\\nthe girl said.”\\n\\n\\n“Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate\\nman, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his\\nlittle game, like those out-and-out pirates who will leave no survivor from a\\ncaptured ship. Well, every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it\\nwe shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for\\nEyford.”\\n\\n\\nSome three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together, bound from\\nReading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock Holmes, the\\nhydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes\\nman, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon\\nthe seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford for its\\ncentre.\\n\\n\\n“There you are,” said he. “That circle is drawn at a radius\\nof ten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near that\\nline. You said ten miles, I think, sir.”\\n\\n\\n“It was an hour’s good drive.”\\n\\n\\n“And you think that they brought you back all that way when you were\\nunconscious?”\\n\\n\\n“They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been\\nlifted and conveyed somewhere.”\\n\\n\\n“What I cannot understand,” said I, “is why they should have\\nspared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the\\nvillain was softened by the woman’s entreaties.”\\n\\n\\n“I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my\\nlife.”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,” said Bradstreet.\\n“Well, I have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon\\nit the folk that we are in search of are to be found.”\\n\\n\\n“I think I could lay my finger on it,” said Holmes quietly.\\n\\n\\n“Really, now!” cried the inspector, “you have formed your\\nopinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for\\nthe country is more deserted there.”\\n\\n\\n“And I say east,” said my patient.\\n\\n\\n“I am for west,” remarked the plain-clothes man. “There are\\nseveral quiet little villages up there.”\\n\\n\\n“And I am for north,” said I, “because there are no hills\\nthere, and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up\\nany.”\\n\\n\\n“Come,” cried the inspector, laughing; “it’s a very\\npretty diversity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you\\ngive your casting vote to?”\\n\\n\\n“You are all wrong.”\\n\\n\\n“But we can’t all be.”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yes, you can. This is my point.” He placed his finger in the\\ncentre of the circle. “This is where we shall find them.”\\n\\n\\n“But the twelve-mile drive?” gasped Hatherley.\\n\\n\\n“Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse\\nwas fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had gone\\ntwelve miles over heavy roads?”\\n\\n\\n“Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,” observed Bradstreet\\nthoughtfully. “Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this\\ngang.”\\n\\n\\n“None at all,” said Holmes. “They are coiners on a large\\nscale, and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place\\nof silver.”\\n\\n\\n“We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,” said\\nthe inspector. “They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand.\\nWe even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they had\\ncovered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands. But\\nnow, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right\\nenough.”\\n\\n\\nBut the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined to fall\\ninto the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic\\ncolumn of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the\\nneighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.\\n\\n\\n“A house on fire?” asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again\\non its way.\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir!” said the station-master.\\n\\n\\n“When did it break out?”\\n\\n\\n“I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and the\\nwhole place is in a blaze.”\\n\\n\\n“Whose house is it?”\\n\\n\\n“Dr. Becher’s.”\\n\\n\\n“Tell me,” broke in the engineer, “is Dr. Becher a German,\\nvery thin, with a long, sharp nose?”\\n\\n\\nThe station-master laughed heartily. “No, sir, Dr. Becher is an\\nEnglishman, and there isn’t a man in the parish who has a better-lined\\nwaistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I understand,\\nwho is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would do\\nhim no harm.”\\n\\n\\nThe station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in\\nthe direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and there was a great\\nwidespread whitewashed building in front of us, spouting fire at every chink\\nand window, while in the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly\\nstriving to keep the flames under.\\n\\n\\n“That’s it!” cried Hatherley, in intense excitement.\\n“There is the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay.\\nThat second window is the one that I jumped from.”\\n\\n\\n“Well, at least,” said Holmes, “you have had your revenge\\nupon them. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it\\nwas crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt they\\nwere too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time. Now keep\\nyour eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night, though I very much\\nfear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.”\\n\\n\\nAnd Holmes’ fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no word\\nhas ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or the\\nmorose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing\\nseveral people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of\\nReading, but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even\\nHolmes’ ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their\\nwhereabouts.\\n\\n\\nThe firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had\\nfound within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon\\na window-sill of the second floor. About sunset, however, their efforts were at\\nlast successful, and they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had\\nfallen in, and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save\\nsome twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery\\nwhich had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel\\nand of tin were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be\\nfound, which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have\\nbeen already referred to.\\n\\n\\nHow our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where\\nhe recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for\\nthe soft mould, which told us a very plain tale. He had evidently been carried\\ndown by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other\\nunusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the silent\\nEnglishman, being less bold or less murderous than his companion, had assisted\\nthe woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger.\\n\\n\\n“Well,” said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return\\nonce more to London, “it has been a pretty business for me! I have lost\\nmy thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?”\\n\\n\\n“Experience,” said Holmes, laughing. “Indirectly it may be of\\nvalue, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of\\nbeing excellent company for the remainder of your existence.”\\n',\n",

       "  'body': '\\nIsa Whitney, brother of\\nthe late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the Theological College of St.\\nGeorge’s, was much addicted to opium. The habit grew upon him, as I\\nunderstand, from some foolish freak when he was at college; for having read De\\nQuincey’s description of his dreams and sensations, he had drenched his\\ntobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects. He found, as\\nso many more have done, that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid\\nof, and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of\\nmingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with\\nyellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a\\nchair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.\\n\\n\\nOne night—it was in June, ’89—there came a ring to my bell,\\nabout the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat\\nup in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made a\\nlittle face of disappointment.\\n\\n\\n“A patient!” said she. “You’ll have to go out.”\\n\\n\\nI groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.\\n\\n\\nWe heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon the\\nlinoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some dark-coloured stuff,\\nwith a black veil, entered the room.\\n\\n\\n“You will excuse my calling so late,” she began, and then, suddenly\\nlosing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my wife’s\\nneck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. “Oh, I’m in such\\ntrouble!” she cried; “I do so want a little help.”\\n\\n\\n“Why,” said my wife, pulling up her veil, “it is Kate\\nWhitney. How you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you\\ncame in.”\\n\\n\\n“I didn’t know what to do, so I came straight to you.” That\\nwas always the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a\\nlighthouse.\\n\\n\\n“It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and\\nwater, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you rather\\nthat I sent James off to bed?”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, no, no! I want the doctor’s advice and help, too. It’s\\nabout Isa. He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about\\nhim!”\\n\\n\\nIt was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband’s\\ntrouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion.\\nWe soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find. Did she know where\\nher husband was? Was it possible that we could bring him back to her?\\n\\n\\nIt seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he had, when\\nthe fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the City.\\nHitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had come back,\\ntwitching and shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him\\neight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the dregs of the\\ndocks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects. There he was to be\\nfound, she was sure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what\\nwas she to do? How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a\\nplace and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?\\n\\n\\nThere was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it. Might I not\\nescort her to this place? And then, as a second thought, why should she come at\\nall? I was Isa Whitney’s medical adviser, and as such I had influence\\nover him. I could manage it better if I were alone. I promised her on my word\\nthat I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the\\naddress which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair\\nand cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a\\nstrange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only could\\nshow how strange it was to be.\\n\\n\\nBut there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure. Upper\\nSwandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the\\nnorth side of the river to the east of London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a\\ngin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap\\nlike the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search. Ordering my\\ncab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the\\nceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp\\nabove the door I found the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick\\nand heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the\\nforecastle of an emigrant ship.\\n\\n\\nThrough the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange\\nfantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back, and chins\\npointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the\\nnewcomer. Out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light,\\nnow bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the\\nmetal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others\\ntalked together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming\\nin gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his\\nown thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At the\\nfarther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a\\nthree-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw resting\\nupon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the fire.\\n\\n\\nAs I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a\\nsupply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.\\n\\n\\n“Thank you. I have not come to stay,” said I. “There is a\\nfriend of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.”\\n\\n\\nThere was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering through the\\ngloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out at me.\\n\\n\\n“My God! It’s Watson,” said he. He was in a pitiable state of\\nreaction, with every nerve in a twitter. “I say, Watson, what\\no’clock is it?”\\n\\n\\n“Nearly eleven.”\\n\\n\\n“Of what day?”\\n\\n\\n“Of Friday, June 19th.”\\n\\n\\n“Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What\\nd’you want to frighten a chap for?” He sank his face onto his arms\\nand began to sob in a high treble key.\\n\\n\\n“I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two\\ndays for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!”\\n\\n\\n“So I am. But you’ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a\\nfew hours, three pipes, four pipes—I forget how many. But I’ll go\\nhome with you. I wouldn’t frighten Kate—poor little Kate. Give me\\nyour hand! Have you a cab?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, I have one waiting.”\\n\\n\\n“Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe,\\nWatson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself.”\\n\\n\\nI walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers, holding my\\nbreath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking about\\nfor the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a\\nsudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, “Walk past me, and\\nthen look back at me.” The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I\\nglanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he\\nsat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium\\npipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer\\nlassitude from his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took\\nall my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment.\\nHe had turned his back so that none could see him but I. His form had filled\\nout, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had regained their fire, and there,\\nsitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock\\nHolmes. He made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he\\nturned his face half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering,\\nloose-lipped senility.\\n\\n\\n“Holmes!” I whispered, “what on earth are you doing in this\\nden?”\\n\\n\\n“As low as you can,” he answered; “I have excellent ears. If\\nyou would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I\\nshould be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.”\\n\\n\\n“I have a cab outside.”\\n\\n\\n“Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he appears\\nto be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you also to send a\\nnote by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with\\nme. If you will wait outside, I shall be with you in five minutes.”\\n\\n\\nIt was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes’ requests, for they\\nwere always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet air of\\nmastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in the cab my\\nmission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish\\nanything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular\\nadventures which were the normal condition of his existence. In a few minutes I\\nhad written my note, paid Whitney’s bill, led him out to the cab, and\\nseen him driven through the darkness. In a very short time a decrepit figure\\nhad emerged from the opium den, and I was walking down the street with Sherlock\\nHolmes. For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain\\nfoot. Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into\\na hearty fit of laughter.\\n\\n\\n“I suppose, Watson,” said he, “that you imagine that I have\\nadded opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little weaknesses\\non which you have favoured me with your medical views.”\\n\\n\\n“I was certainly surprised to find you there.”\\n\\n\\n“But not more so than I to find you.”\\n\\n\\n“I came to find a friend.”\\n\\n\\n“And I to find an enemy.”\\n\\n\\n“An enemy?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey.\\nBriefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I have\\nhoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as I have done\\nbefore now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth\\nan hour’s purchase; for I have used it before now for my own purposes,\\nand the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me. There\\nis a trap-door at the back of that building, near the corner of Paul’s\\nWharf, which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon\\nthe moonless nights.”\\n\\n\\n“What! You do not mean bodies?”\\n\\n\\n“Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had Â£ 1000 for every\\npoor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest murder-trap\\non the whole riverside, and I fear that Neville St. Clair has entered it never\\nto leave it more. But our trap should be here.” He put his two\\nforefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly—a signal which was\\nanswered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle\\nof wheels and the clink of horses’ hoofs.\\n\\n\\n“Now, Watson,” said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through\\nthe gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side\\nlanterns. “You’ll come with me, won’t you?”\\n\\n\\n“If I can be of use.”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so.\\nMy room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.”\\n\\n\\n“The Cedars?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair’s house. I am staying there while I\\nconduct the inquiry.”\\n\\n\\n“Where is it, then?”\\n\\n\\n“Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.”\\n\\n\\n“But I am all in the dark.”\\n\\n\\n“Of course you are. You’ll know all about it presently. Jump up\\nhere. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here’s half a crown. Look\\nout for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!”\\n\\n\\nHe flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the endless\\nsuccession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened gradually, until we\\nwere flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing\\nsluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar,\\nits silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman, or the\\nsongs and shouts of some belated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting\\nslowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through\\nthe rifts of the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his\\nbreast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside him,\\ncurious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so\\nsorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts. We had\\ndriven several miles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of\\nsuburban villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his\\npipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the\\nbest.\\n\\n\\n“You have a grand gift of silence, Watson,” said he. “It\\nmakes you quite invaluable as a companion. ’Pon my word, it is a great\\nthing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not\\nover-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman\\nto-night when she meets me at the door.”\\n\\n\\n“You forget that I know nothing about it.”\\n\\n\\n“I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get\\nto Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to go\\nupon. There’s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can’t get the end\\nof it into my hand. Now, I’ll state the case clearly and concisely to\\nyou, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.”\\n\\n\\n“Proceed, then.”\\n\\n\\n“Some years ago—to be definite, in May, 1884—there came to\\nLee a gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of\\nmoney. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived\\ngenerally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood, and\\nin 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now has two\\nchildren. He had no occupation, but was interested in several companies and\\nwent into town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon\\nStreet every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of\\ntemperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is\\npopular with all who know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present\\nmoment, as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to Â£ 88 10s.,\\nwhile he has Â£ 220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank.\\nThere is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been weighing\\nupon his mind.\\n\\n\\n“Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier than\\nusual, remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to\\nperform, and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks. Now, by\\nthe merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday, very\\nshortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable\\nvalue which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the\\nAberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up in your London, you will\\nknow that the office of the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of\\nUpper Swandam Lane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch,\\nstarted for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company’s\\noffice, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through\\nSwandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me so\\nfar?”\\n\\n\\n“It is very clear.”\\n\\n\\n“If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St. Clair\\nwalked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not like\\nthe neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was walking in this way\\ndown Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck\\ncold to see her husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning\\nto her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she distinctly saw\\nhis face, which she describes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands\\nfrantically to her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it\\nseemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from\\nbehind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that\\nalthough he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he had on\\nneither collar nor necktie.\\n\\n\\n“Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the\\nsteps—for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found\\nme to-night—and running through the front room she attempted to ascend\\nthe stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the stairs, however,\\nshe met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and,\\naided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street.\\nFilled with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane and,\\nby rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of constables with an\\ninspector, all on their way to their beat. The inspector and two men\\naccompanied her back, and in spite of the continued resistance of the\\nproprietor, they made their way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last\\nbeen seen. There was no sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor\\nthere was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it\\nseems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one\\nelse had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined was their\\ndenial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to believe that\\nMrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal\\nbox which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell a cascade\\nof children’s bricks. It was the toy which he had promised to bring home.\\n\\n\\n“This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made\\nthe inspector realise that the matter was serious. The rooms were carefully\\nexamined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. The front room was\\nplainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked\\nout upon the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom\\nwindow is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide\\nwith at least four and a half feet of water. The bedroom window was a broad one\\nand opened from below. On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the\\nwindowsill, and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of\\nthe bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the\\nclothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of his coat. His boots,\\nhis socks, his hat, and his watch—all were there. There were no signs of\\nviolence upon any of these garments, and there were no other traces of Mr.\\nNeville St. Clair. Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other\\nexit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little\\npromise that he could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very\\nhighest at the moment of the tragedy.\\n\\n\\n“And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in\\nthe matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but as,\\nby Mrs. St. Clair’s story, he was known to have been at the foot of the\\nstair within a very few seconds of her husband’s appearance at the\\nwindow, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His\\ndefence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no\\nknowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he could not\\naccount in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman’s clothes.\\n\\n\\n“So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives\\nupon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last human\\nbeing whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his\\nhideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the City.\\nHe is a professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police regulations he\\npretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle\\nStreet, upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small\\nangle in the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,\\ncross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a piteous\\nspectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which\\nlies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the fellow more than once\\nbefore ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance, and I have been\\nsurprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His appearance,\\nyou see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him. A\\nshock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its\\ncontraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and\\na pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the\\ncolour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants\\nand so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of\\nchaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now\\nlearn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been the last man\\nto see the gentleman of whom we are in quest.”\\n\\n\\n“But a cripple!” said I. “What could he have done\\nsingle-handed against a man in the prime of life?”\\n\\n\\n“He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other\\nrespects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your medical\\nexperience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is often\\ncompensated for by exceptional strength in the others.”\\n\\n\\n“Pray continue your narrative.”\\n\\n\\n“Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window,\\nand she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be of\\nno help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who had charge of\\nthe case, made a very careful examination of the premises, but without finding\\nanything which threw any light upon the matter. One mistake had been made in\\nnot arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes during which\\nhe might have communicated with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon\\nremedied, and he was seized and searched, without anything being found which\\ncould incriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right\\nshirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been cut near the\\nnail, and explained that the bleeding came from there, adding that he had been\\nto the window not long before, and that the stains which had been observed\\nthere came doubtless from the same source. He denied strenuously having ever\\nseen Mr. Neville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his\\nroom was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St.\\nClair’s assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window,\\nhe declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed,\\nloudly protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon the\\npremises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.\\n\\n\\n“And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had\\nfeared to find. It was Neville St. Clair’s coat, and not Neville St.\\nClair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think they\\nfound in the pockets?”\\n\\n\\n“I cannot imagine.”\\n\\n\\n“No, I don’t think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with\\npennies and half-pennies—421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no\\nwonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a\\ndifferent matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house. It\\nseemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body\\nhad been sucked away into the river.”\\n\\n\\n“But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room.\\nWould the body be dressed in a coat alone?”\\n\\n\\n“No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that this\\nman Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there is no human\\neye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then? It would of course\\ninstantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would\\nseize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it would occur\\nto him that it would swim and not sink. He has little time, for he has heard\\nthe scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he\\nhas already heard from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up\\nthe street. There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret hoard,\\nwhere he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all the coins\\nupon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the\\ncoat’s sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same with the\\nother garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and only just had time\\nto close the window when the police appeared.”\\n\\n\\n“It certainly sounds feasible.”\\n\\n\\n“Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better.\\nBoone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but it could\\nnot be shown that there had ever before been anything against him. He had for\\nyears been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a\\nvery quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and the\\nquestions which have to be solved—what Neville St. Clair was doing in the\\nopium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what Hugh\\nBoone had to do with his disappearance—are all as far from a solution as\\never. I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked\\nat the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties.”\\n\\n\\nWhile Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events, we had\\nbeen whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling\\nhouses had been left behind, and we rattled along with a country hedge upon\\neither side of us. Just as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered\\nvillages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.\\n\\n\\n“We are on the outskirts of Lee,” said my companion. “We have\\ntouched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex,\\npassing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light among the\\ntrees? That is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears\\nhave already, I have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse’s\\nfeet.”\\n\\n\\n“But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?” I\\nasked.\\n\\n\\n“Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs. St.\\nClair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest assured\\nthat she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague. I hate to\\nmeet her, Watson, when I have no news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa, there,\\nwhoa!”\\n\\n\\nWe had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds.\\nA stable-boy had run out to the horse’s head, and springing down, I\\nfollowed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to the house. As\\nwe approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the\\nopening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy\\npink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined against\\nthe flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness,\\nher body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted\\nlips, a standing question.\\n\\n\\n“Well?” she cried, “well?” And then, seeing that there\\nwere two of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that\\nmy companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n\\n“No good news?”\\n\\n\\n“None.”\\n\\n\\n“No bad?”\\n\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n\\n“Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a\\nlong day.”\\n\\n\\n“This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in\\nseveral of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring\\nhim out and associate him with this investigation.”\\n\\n\\n“I am delighted to see you,” said she, pressing my hand warmly.\\n“You will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our\\narrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon\\nus.”\\n\\n\\n“My dear madam,” said I, “I am an old campaigner, and if I\\nwere not I can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of any\\nassistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed happy.”\\n\\n\\n“Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said the lady as we entered a well-lit\\ndining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out, “I\\nshould very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to which I beg\\nthat you will give a plain answer.”\\n\\n\\n“Certainly, madam.”\\n\\n\\n“Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to\\nfainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.”\\n\\n\\n“Upon what point?”\\n\\n\\n“In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?”\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. “Frankly,\\nnow!” she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him\\nas he leaned back in a basket-chair.\\n\\n\\n“Frankly, then, madam, I do not.”\\n\\n\\n“You think that he is dead?”\\n\\n\\n“I do.”\\n\\n\\n“Murdered?”\\n\\n\\n“I don’t say that. Perhaps.”\\n\\n\\n“And on what day did he meet his death?”\\n\\n\\n“On Monday.”\\n\\n\\n“Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is\\nthat I have received a letter from him to-day.”\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.\\n\\n\\n“What!” he roared.\\n\\n\\n“Yes, to-day.” She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper\\nin the air.\\n\\n\\n“May I see it?”\\n\\n\\n“Certainly.”\\n\\n\\nHe snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the table\\nhe drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I had left my chair and was\\ngazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a very coarse one and was\\nstamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day, or\\nrather of the day before, for it was considerably after midnight.\\n\\n\\n“Coarse writing,” murmured Holmes. “Surely this is not your\\nhusband’s writing, madam.”\\n\\n\\n“No, but the enclosure is.”\\n\\n\\n“I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and\\ninquire as to the address.”\\n\\n\\n“How can you tell that?”\\n\\n\\n“The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself.\\nThe rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has been\\nused. If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none would be of a\\ndeep black shade. This man has written the name, and there has then been a\\npause before he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not familiar\\nwith it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as\\ntrifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha! there has been an enclosure\\nhere!”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.”\\n\\n\\n“And you are sure that this is your husband’s hand?”\\n\\n\\n“One of his hands.”\\n\\n\\n“One?”\\n\\n\\n“His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing,\\nand yet I know it well.”\\n\\n\\n“‘Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is\\na huge error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in\\npatience.—NEVILLE.’ Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book,\\noctavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man with a\\ndirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very much in error,\\nby a person who had been chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is your\\nhusband’s hand, madam?”\\n\\n\\n“None. Neville wrote those words.”\\n\\n\\n“And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the\\nclouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is\\nover.”\\n\\n\\n“But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.”\\n\\n\\n“Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The ring,\\nafter all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from him.”\\n\\n\\n“No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!”\\n\\n\\n“Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only posted\\nto-day.”\\n\\n\\n“That is possible.”\\n\\n\\n“If so, much may have happened between.”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well with\\nhim. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if evil came\\nupon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom,\\nand yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost\\ncertainty that something had happened. Do you think that I would respond to\\nsuch a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?”\\n\\n\\n“I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be\\nmore valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. And in this letter\\nyou certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view.\\nBut if your husband is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain\\naway from you?”\\n\\n\\n“I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable.”\\n\\n\\n“And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?”\\n\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n\\n“And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?”\\n\\n\\n“Very much so.”\\n\\n\\n“Was the window open?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n\\n“Then he might have called to you?”\\n\\n\\n“He might.”\\n\\n\\n“He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n\\n“A call for help, you thought?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes. He waved his hands.”\\n\\n\\n“But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the unexpected\\nsight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?”\\n\\n\\n“It is possible.”\\n\\n\\n“And you thought he was pulled back?”\\n\\n\\n“He disappeared so suddenly.”\\n\\n\\n“He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the\\nroom?”\\n\\n\\n“No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the Lascar\\nwas at the foot of the stairs.”\\n\\n\\n“Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary\\nclothes on?”\\n\\n\\n“But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat.”\\n\\n\\n“Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?”\\n\\n\\n“Never.”\\n\\n\\n“Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?”\\n\\n\\n“Never.”\\n\\n\\n“Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which I\\nwished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and then\\nretire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.”\\n\\n\\nA large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and\\nI was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after my night of adventure.\\nSherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon\\nhis mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it\\nover, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he\\nhad either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient. It\\nwas soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He\\ntook off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then\\nwandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the\\nsofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon\\nwhich he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box\\nof matches laid out in front of him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him\\nsitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon\\nthe corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent,\\nmotionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he\\nsat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused\\nme to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. The pipe\\nwas still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was\\nfull of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I\\nhad seen upon the previous night.\\n\\n\\n“Awake, Watson?” he asked.\\n\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n\\n“Game for a morning drive?”\\n\\n\\n“Certainly.”\\n\\n\\n“Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy\\nsleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.” He chuckled to himself as\\nhe spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre\\nthinker of the previous night.\\n\\n\\nAs I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was stirring.\\nIt was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished when Holmes\\nreturned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.\\n\\n\\n“I want to test a little theory of mine,” said he, pulling on his\\nboots. “I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one\\nof the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from here to\\nCharing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now.”\\n\\n\\n“And where is it?” I asked, smiling.\\n\\n\\n“In the bathroom,” he answered. “Oh, yes, I am not\\njoking,” he continued, seeing my look of incredulity. “I have just\\nbeen there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag.\\nCome on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.”\\n\\n\\nWe made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the bright\\nmorning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad\\nstable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away we dashed down the\\nLondon Road. A few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the\\nmetropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless\\nas some city in a dream.\\n\\n\\n“It has been in some points a singular case,” said Holmes, flicking\\nthe horse on into a gallop. “I confess that I have been as blind as a\\nmole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at\\nall.”\\n\\n\\nIn town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their\\nwindows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side. Passing down the\\nWaterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and dashing up Wellington\\nStreet wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock\\nHolmes was well known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted\\nhim. One of them held the horse’s head while the other led us in.\\n\\n\\n“Who is on duty?” asked Holmes.\\n\\n\\n“Inspector Bradstreet, sir.”\\n\\n\\n“Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?” A tall, stout official had come down\\nthe stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. “I wish to\\nhave a quiet word with you, Bradstreet.”\\n\\n\\n“Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here.”\\n\\n\\nIt was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a\\ntelephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his desk.\\n\\n\\n“What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?”\\n\\n\\n“I called about that beggarman, Boone—the one who was charged with\\nbeing concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.”\\n\\n\\n“Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.”\\n\\n\\n“So I heard. You have him here?”\\n\\n\\n“In the cells.”\\n\\n\\n“Is he quiet?”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.”\\n\\n\\n“Dirty?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as\\nblack as a tinker’s. Well, when once his case has been settled, he will\\nhave a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would agree with\\nme that he needed it.”\\n\\n\\n“I should like to see him very much.”\\n\\n\\n“Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your\\nbag.”\\n\\n\\n“No, I think that I’ll take it.”\\n\\n\\n“Very good. Come this way, if you please.” He led us down a\\npassage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a\\nwhitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.\\n\\n\\n“The third on the right is his,” said the inspector. “Here it\\nis!” He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and\\nglanced through.\\n\\n\\n“He is asleep,” said he. “You can see him very well.”\\n\\n\\nWe both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face towards us,\\nin a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was a middle-sized man,\\ncoarsely clad as became his calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through\\nthe rent in his tattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremely\\ndirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive\\nugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin,\\nand by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three\\nteeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew\\nlow over his eyes and forehead.\\n\\n\\n“He’s a beauty, isn’t he?” said the inspector.\\n\\n\\n“He certainly needs a wash,” remarked Holmes. “I had an idea\\nthat he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.” He\\nopened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very\\nlarge bath-sponge.\\n\\n\\n“He! he! You are a funny one,” chuckled the inspector.\\n\\n\\n“Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly,\\nwe will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.”\\n\\n\\n“Well, I don’t know why not,” said the inspector. “He\\ndoesn’t look a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?” He slipped\\nhis key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper\\nhalf turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes\\nstooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice\\nvigorously across and down the prisoner’s face.\\n\\n\\n“Let me introduce you,” he shouted, “to Mr. Neville St.\\nClair, of Lee, in the county of Kent.”\\n\\n\\nNever in my life have I seen such a sight. The man’s face peeled off\\nunder the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown tint!\\nGone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and the twisted lip\\nwhich had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the\\ntangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced,\\nrefined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and\\nstaring about him with sleepy bewilderment. Then suddenly realising the\\nexposure, he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the\\npillow.\\n\\n\\n“Great heavens!” cried the inspector, “it is, indeed, the\\nmissing man. I know him from the photograph.”\\n\\n\\nThe prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his\\ndestiny. “Be it so,” said he. “And pray what am I charged\\nwith?”\\n\\n\\n“With making away with Mr. Neville St.— Oh, come, you can’t\\nbe charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,”\\nsaid the inspector with a grin. “Well, I have been twenty-seven years in\\nthe force, but this really takes the cake.”\\n\\n\\n“If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has been\\ncommitted, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.”\\n\\n\\n“No crime, but a very great error has been committed,” said Holmes.\\n“You would have done better to have trusted your wife.”\\n\\n\\n“It was not the wife; it was the children,” groaned the prisoner.\\n“God help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What\\nan exposure! What can I do?”\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the\\nshoulder.\\n\\n\\n“If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,” said\\nhe, “of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you\\nconvince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you, I\\ndo not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way\\ninto the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon\\nanything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The\\ncase would then never go into court at all.”\\n\\n\\n“God bless you!” cried the prisoner passionately. “I would\\nhave endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my\\nmiserable secret as a family blot to my children.\\n\\n\\n“You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a\\nschoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education. I\\ntravelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an\\nevening paper in London. One day my editor wished to have a series of articles\\nupon begging in the metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them. There was the\\npoint from which all my adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an\\namateur that I could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an\\nactor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been\\nfamous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my attainments.\\nI painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good\\nscar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of\\nflesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress,\\nI took my station in the business part of the city, ostensibly as a\\nmatch-seller but really as a beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when\\nI returned home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no\\nless than 26s. 4d.\\n\\n\\n“I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some\\ntime later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for Â£\\n25. I was at my wit’s end where to get the money, but a sudden idea came\\nto me. I begged a fortnight’s grace from the creditor, asked for a\\nholiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the City under my\\ndisguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.\\n\\n\\n“Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at\\nÂ£ 2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face\\nwith a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still. It was a\\nlong fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I\\nthrew up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first\\nchosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers.\\nOnly one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to\\nlodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar\\nand in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This\\nfellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that my\\nsecret was safe in his possession.\\n\\n\\n“Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money. I\\ndo not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn Â£ 700 a\\nyear—which is less than my average takings—but I had exceptional\\nadvantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee, which\\nimproved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City. All\\nday a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, and it was a very\\nbad day in which I failed to take Â£ 2.\\n\\n\\n“As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country, and\\neventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation.\\nMy dear wife knew that I had business in the City. She little knew what.\\n\\n\\n“Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above\\nthe opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my horror and\\nastonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her eyes fixed full\\nupon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and,\\nrushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from\\ncoming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that she could not\\nascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on\\nmy pigments and wig. Even a wife’s eyes could not pierce so complete a\\ndisguise. But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room,\\nand that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by my\\nviolence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that\\nmorning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the coppers which I had\\njust transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings. I\\nhurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other\\nclothes would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of constables\\nup the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief,\\nthat instead of being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as\\nhis murderer.\\n\\n\\n“I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was\\ndetermined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference\\nfor a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slipped off\\nmy ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was\\nwatching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause\\nto fear.”\\n\\n\\n“That note only reached her yesterday,” said Holmes.\\n\\n\\n“Good God! What a week she must have spent!”\\n\\n\\n“The police have watched this Lascar,” said Inspector Bradstreet,\\n“and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a\\nletter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who\\nforgot all about it for some days.”\\n\\n\\n“That was it,” said Holmes, nodding approvingly; “I have no\\ndoubt of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?”\\n\\n\\n“Many times; but what was a fine to me?”\\n\\n\\n“It must stop here, however,” said Bradstreet. “If the police\\nare to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.”\\n\\n\\n“I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.”\\n\\n\\n“In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be\\ntaken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure, Mr.\\nHolmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up.\\nI wish I knew how you reach your results.”\\n\\n\\n“I reached this one,” said my friend, “by sitting upon five\\npillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to\\nBaker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast.”\\n',\n",

       "  'body': '\\nWhen I glance over my\\nnotes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases between the years ’82 and\\n’90, I am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features\\nthat it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some,\\nhowever, have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have not\\noffered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so\\nhigh a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some,\\ntoo, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings\\nwithout an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and have\\ntheir explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that\\nabsolute logical proof which was so dear to him. There is, however, one of\\nthese last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its\\nresults that I am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that\\nthere are points in connection with it which never have been, and probably\\nnever will be, entirely cleared up.\\n\\n\\nThe year ’87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less\\ninterest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under this one\\ntwelve months I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the\\nAmateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a\\nfurniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the British barque\\nSophy Anderson, of the singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the\\nisland of Uffa, and finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as\\nmay be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man’s\\nwatch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that therefore\\nthe deceased had gone to bed within that time—a deduction which was of\\nthe greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these I may sketch out at\\nsome future date, but none of them present such singular features as the\\nstrange train of circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.\\n\\n\\nIt was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had set in\\nwith exceptional violence. All day the wind had screamed and the rain had\\nbeaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of great, hand-made\\nLondon we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of\\nlife and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek\\nat mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage.\\nAs evening drew in, the storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and\\nsobbed like a child in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of\\nthe fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was\\ndeep in one of Clark Russell’s fine sea-stories until the howl of the\\ngale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the rain to\\nlengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My wife was on a visit to\\nher mother’s, and for a few days I was a dweller once more in my old\\nquarters at Baker Street.\\n\\n\\n“Why,” said I, glancing up at my companion, “that was surely\\nthe bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?”\\n\\n\\n“Except yourself I have none,” he answered. “I do not\\nencourage visitors.”\\n\\n\\n“A client, then?”\\n\\n\\n“If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on such\\na day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to be some\\ncrony of the landlady’s.”\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a step in\\nthe passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his long arm to turn\\nthe lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer\\nmust sit.\\n\\n\\n“Come in!” said he.\\n\\n\\nThe man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside, well-groomed\\nand trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing. The\\nstreaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof\\ntold of the fierce weather through which he had come. He looked about him\\nanxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his face was pale and\\nhis eyes heavy, like those of a man who is weighed down with some great\\nanxiety.\\n\\n\\n“I owe you an apology,” he said, raising his golden pince-nez to\\nhis eyes. “I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought\\nsome traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.”\\n\\n\\n“Give me your coat and umbrella,” said Holmes. “They may rest\\nhere on the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from the\\nsouth-west, I see.”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, from Horsham.”\\n\\n\\n“That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite\\ndistinctive.”\\n\\n\\n“I have come for advice.”\\n\\n\\n“That is easily got.”\\n\\n\\n“And help.”\\n\\n\\n“That is not always so easy.”\\n\\n\\n“I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how you\\nsaved him in the Tankerville Club scandal.”\\n\\n\\n“Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.”\\n\\n\\n“He said that you could solve anything.”\\n\\n\\n“He said too much.”\\n\\n\\n“That you are never beaten.”\\n\\n\\n“I have been beaten four times—three times by men, and once by a\\nwoman.”\\n\\n\\n“But what is that compared with the number of your successes?”\\n\\n\\n“It is true that I have been generally successful.”\\n\\n\\n“Then you may be so with me.”\\n\\n\\n“I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with\\nsome details as to your case.”\\n\\n\\n“It is no ordinary one.”\\n\\n\\n“None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of\\nappeal.”\\n\\n\\n“And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have ever\\nlistened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which\\nhave happened in my own family.”\\n\\n\\n“You fill me with interest,” said Holmes. “Pray give us the\\nessential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to\\nthose details which seem to me to be most important.”\\n\\n\\nThe young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the\\nblaze.\\n\\n\\n“My name,” said he, “is John Openshaw, but my own affairs\\nhave, as far as I can understand, little to do with this awful business. It is\\na hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must go\\nback to the commencement of the affair.\\n\\n\\n“You must know that my grandfather had two sons—my uncle Elias and\\nmy father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which he enlarged\\nat the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee of the Openshaw\\nunbreakable tire, and his business met with such success that he was able to\\nsell it and to retire upon a handsome competence.\\n\\n\\n“My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became a\\nplanter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well. At the time\\nof the war he fought in Jackson’s army, and afterwards under Hood, where\\nhe rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his\\nplantation, where he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he\\ncame back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had\\nmade a very considerable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving them\\nwas his aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in\\nextending the franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and\\nquick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring\\ndisposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if ever he\\nset foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three fields round his house,\\nand there he would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he\\nwould never leave his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very\\nheavily, but he would see no society and did not want any friends, not even his\\nown brother.\\n\\n\\n“He didn’t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time\\nwhen he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be in the\\nyear 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He begged my\\nfather to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way. When he\\nwas sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he\\nwould make me his representative both with the servants and with the\\ntradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the\\nhouse. I kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do what I liked, so\\nlong as I did not disturb him in his privacy. There was one singular exception,\\nhowever, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was\\ninvariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to\\nenter. With a boy’s curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I\\nwas never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as\\nwould be expected in such a room.\\n\\n\\n“One day—it was in March, 1883—a letter with a foreign stamp\\nlay upon the table in front of the colonel’s plate. It was not a common\\nthing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money,\\nand he had no friends of any sort. ‘From India!’ said he as he took\\nit up, ‘Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?’ Opening it\\nhurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down\\nupon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips\\nat the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his\\nskin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held in\\nhis trembling hand, ‘K. K. K.!’ he shrieked, and then, ‘My\\nGod, my God, my sins have overtaken me!’\\n\\n\\n“‘What is it, uncle?’ I cried.\\n\\n\\n“‘Death,’ said he, and rising from the table he retired\\nto his room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and saw\\nscrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter K three\\ntimes repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried pips. What could be\\nthe reason of his overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I\\nascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must have\\nbelonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in\\nthe other.\\n\\n\\n“‘They may do what they like, but I’ll checkmate them\\nstill,’ said he with an oath. ‘Tell Mary that I shall want a fire\\nin my room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.’\\n\\n\\n“I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step up\\nto the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there was a mass\\nof black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass box stood open and\\nempty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the\\nlid was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope.\\n\\n\\n“‘I wish you, John,’ said my uncle, ‘to witness\\nmy will. I leave my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages,\\nto my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you\\ncan enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my advice,\\nmy boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to give you such a\\ntwo-edged thing, but I can’t say what turn things are going to take.\\nKindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.’\\n\\n\\n“I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him.\\nThe singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon me,\\nand I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to\\nmake anything of it. Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which\\nit left behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and\\nnothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I could see a\\nchange in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined\\nfor any sort of society. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the\\ndoor locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken\\nfrenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a\\nrevolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man, and that he\\nwas not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil. When these hot\\nfits were over, however, he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and\\nbar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the\\nterror which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face,\\neven on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a\\nbasin.\\n\\n\\n“Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse your\\npatience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from\\nwhich he never came back. We found him, when we went to search for him, face\\ndownward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden.\\nThere was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep, so that\\nthe jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of\\n‘suicide.’ But I, who knew how he winced from the very thought of\\ndeath, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet\\nit. The matter passed, however, and my father entered into possession of the\\nestate, and of some Â£ 14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.”\\n\\n\\n“One moment,” Holmes interposed, “your statement is, I\\nforesee, one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have\\nthe date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his\\nsupposed suicide.”\\n\\n\\n“The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later,\\nupon the night of May 2nd.”\\n\\n\\n“Thank you. Pray proceed.”\\n\\n\\n“When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made a\\ncareful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We found the\\nbrass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On the inside of the\\ncover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and\\n‘Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register’ written beneath.\\nThese, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed\\nby Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was nothing of much importance in the\\nattic save a great many scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my\\nuncle’s life in America. Some of them were of the war time and showed\\nthat he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier.\\nOthers were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern states, and\\nwere mostly concerned with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part\\nin opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the North.\\n\\n\\n“Well, it was the beginning of ’84 when my father came to live at\\nHorsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the January of\\n’85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp\\ncry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There he was,\\nsitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in\\nthe outstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what he called\\nmy cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked very scared and puzzled\\nnow that the same thing had come upon himself.\\n\\n\\n“‘Why, what on earth does this mean, John?’ he\\nstammered.\\n\\n\\n“My heart had turned to lead. ‘It is K. K. K.,’ said I.\\n\\n\\n“He looked inside the envelope. ‘So it is,’ he cried.\\n‘Here are the very letters. But what is this written above them?’\\n\\n\\n“‘Put the papers on the sundial,’ I read, peeping over\\nhis shoulder.\\n\\n\\n“‘What papers? What sundial?’ he asked.\\n\\n\\n“‘The sundial in the garden. There is no other,’ said\\nI; ‘but the papers must be those that are destroyed.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Pooh!’ said he, gripping hard at his courage.\\n‘We are in a civilised land here, and we can’t have tomfoolery of\\nthis kind. Where does the thing come from?’\\n\\n\\n“‘From Dundee,’ I answered, glancing at the postmark.\\n\\n\\n“‘Some preposterous practical joke,’ said he.\\n‘What have I to do with sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of\\nsuch nonsense.’\\n\\n\\n“‘I should certainly speak to the police,’ I said.\\n\\n\\n“‘And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Then let me do so?’\\n\\n\\n“‘No, I forbid you. I won’t have a fuss made about such\\nnonsense.’\\n\\n\\n“It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I\\nwent about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.\\n\\n\\n“On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home\\nto visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command of one of the\\nforts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go, for it seemed to me\\nthat he was farther from danger when he was away from home. In that, however, I\\nwas in error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram from the\\nmajor, imploring me to come at once. My father had fallen over one of the deep\\nchalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a\\nshattered skull. I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever\\nrecovered his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham\\nin the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit\\nunfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of ‘death\\nfrom accidental causes.’ Carefully as I examined every fact connected\\nwith his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of\\nmurder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no record of\\nstrangers having been seen upon the roads. And yet I need not tell you that my\\nmind was far from at ease, and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot\\nhad been woven round him.\\n\\n\\n“In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I\\ndid not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our troubles\\nwere in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle’s life, and that\\nthe danger would be as pressing in one house as in another.\\n\\n\\n“It was in January, ’85, that my poor father met his end, and two\\nyears and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time I have lived\\nhappily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed away\\nfrom the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. I had begun to\\ntake comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very\\nshape in which it had come upon my father.”\\n\\n\\nThe young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning to the\\ntable he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.\\n\\n\\n“This is the envelope,” he continued. “The postmark is\\nLondon—eastern division. Within are the very words which were upon my\\nfather’s last message: ‘K. K. K.’; and then ‘Put the\\npapers on the sundial.’”\\n\\n\\n“What have you done?” asked Holmes.\\n\\n\\n“Nothing.”\\n\\n\\n“Nothing?”\\n\\n\\n“To tell the truth”—he sank his face into his thin, white\\nhands—“I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor\\nrabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of\\nsome resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can\\nguard against.”\\n\\n\\n“Tut! tut!” cried Sherlock Holmes. “You must act, man, or you\\nare lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair.”\\n\\n\\n“I have seen the police.”\\n\\n\\n“Ah!”\\n\\n\\n“But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the\\ninspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes, and\\nthat the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as the jury stated, and\\nwere not to be connected with the warnings.”\\n\\n\\nHolmes shook his clenched hands in the air. “Incredible\\nimbecility!” he cried.\\n\\n\\n“They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the house\\nwith me.”\\n\\n\\n“Has he come with you to-night?”\\n\\n\\n“No. His orders were to stay in the house.”\\n\\n\\nAgain Holmes raved in the air.\\n\\n\\n“Why did you come to me?” he said, “and, above all, why did\\nyou not come at once?”\\n\\n\\n“I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast\\nabout my troubles and was advised by him to come to you.”\\n\\n\\n“It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted\\nbefore this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which you have\\nplaced before us—no suggestive detail which might help us?”\\n\\n\\n“There is one thing,” said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat\\npocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it\\nout upon the table. “I have some remembrance,” said he, “that\\non the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small, unburned\\nmargins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour. I found this\\nsingle sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it may\\nbe one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others,\\nand in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not\\nsee that it helps us much. I think myself that it is a page from some private\\ndiary. The writing is undoubtedly my uncle’s.”\\n\\n\\nHolmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which showed\\nby its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It was headed,\\n“March, 1869,” and beneath were the following enigmatical notices:\\n\\n\\n“4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.\\n\\n\\n“7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and John Swain of St.\\nAugustine.\\n\\n\\n“9th. McCauley cleared.\\n\\n\\n“10th. John Swain cleared.\\n\\n\\n“12th. Visited Paramore. All well.”\\n\\n\\n“Thank you!” said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to\\nour visitor. “And now you must on no account lose another instant. We\\ncannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get home\\ninstantly and act.”\\n\\n\\n“What shall I do?”\\n\\n\\n“There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put this\\npiece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have\\ndescribed. You must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were\\nburned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which remains. You must\\nassert that in such words as will carry conviction with them. Having done this,\\nyou must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do you\\nunderstand?”\\n\\n\\n“Entirely.”\\n\\n\\n“Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think\\nthat we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to weave, while\\ntheirs is already woven. The first consideration is to remove the pressing\\ndanger which threatens you. The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish\\nthe guilty parties.”\\n\\n\\n“I thank you,” said the young man, rising and pulling on his\\novercoat. “You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as\\nyou advise.”\\n\\n\\n“Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the\\nmeanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened\\nby a very real and imminent danger. How do you go back?”\\n\\n\\n“By train from Waterloo.”\\n\\n\\n“It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you may\\nbe in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.”\\n\\n\\n“I am armed.”\\n\\n\\n“That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.”\\n\\n\\n“I shall see you at Horsham, then?”\\n\\n\\n“No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it.”\\n\\n\\n“Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to the\\nbox and the papers. I shall take your advice in every particular.” He\\nshook hands with us and took his leave. Outside the wind still screamed and the\\nrain splashed and pattered against the windows. This strange, wild story seemed\\nto have come to us from amid the mad elements—blown in upon us like a\\nsheet of sea-weed in a gale—and now to have been reabsorbed by them once\\nmore.\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk forward and\\nhis eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit his pipe, and leaning\\nback in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up\\nto the ceiling.\\n\\n\\n“I think, Watson,” he remarked at last, “that of all our\\ncases we have had none more fantastic than this.”\\n\\n\\n“Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four.”\\n\\n\\n“Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to me\\nto be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.”\\n\\n\\n“But have you,” I asked, “formed any definite conception as\\nto what these perils are?”\\n\\n\\n“There can be no question as to their nature,” he answered.\\n\\n\\n“Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this\\nunhappy family?”\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his\\nchair, with his finger-tips together. “The ideal reasoner,” he\\nremarked, “would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its\\nbearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it\\nbut also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly\\ndescribe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer\\nwho has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able\\nto accurately state all the other ones, both before and after. We have not yet\\ngrasped the results which the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be\\nsolved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by\\nthe aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is\\nnecessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have\\ncome to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a\\npossession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and\\nencyclopÃ¦dias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so impossible,\\nhowever, that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful\\nto him in his work, and this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember\\nrightly, you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my\\nlimits in a very precise fashion.”\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” I answered, laughing. “It was a singular document.\\nPhilosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany\\nvariable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region within\\nfifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational\\nliterature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer,\\nand self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the main points\\nof my analysis.”\\n\\n\\nHolmes grinned at the last item. “Well,” he said, “I say now,\\nas I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all\\nthe furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the\\nlumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a\\ncase as the one which has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to\\nmuster all our resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the American\\nEncyclopÃ¦dia which stands upon the shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us\\nconsider the situation and see what may be deduced from it. In the first place,\\nwe may start with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very\\nstrong reason for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all\\ntheir habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the\\nlonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of solitude in\\nEngland suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something, so we\\nmay assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something\\nwhich drove him from America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce\\nthat by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and\\nhis successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?”\\n\\n\\n“The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third\\nfrom London.”\\n\\n\\n“From East London. What do you deduce from that?”\\n\\n\\n“They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.”\\n\\n\\n“Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that the\\nprobability—the strong probability—is that the writer was on board\\nof a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of Pondicherry,\\nseven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment, in Dundee it was\\nonly some three or four days. Does that suggest anything?”\\n\\n\\n“A greater distance to travel.”\\n\\n\\n“But the letter had also a greater distance to come.”\\n\\n\\n“Then I do not see the point.”\\n\\n\\n“There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men\\nare is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send their singular warning\\nor token before them when starting upon their mission. You see how quickly the\\ndeed followed the sign when it came from Dundee. If they had come from\\nPondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their\\nletter. But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those seven\\nweeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter\\nand the sailing vessel which brought the writer.”\\n\\n\\n“It is possible.”\\n\\n\\n“More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of\\nthis new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has always\\nfallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the\\ndistance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon\\ndelay.”\\n\\n\\n“Good God!” I cried. “What can it mean, this relentless\\npersecution?”\\n\\n\\n“The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to\\nthe person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite clear that\\nthere must be more than one of them. A single man could not have carried out\\ntwo deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner’s jury. There must have\\nbeen several in it, and they must have been men of resource and determination.\\nTheir papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may. In this way\\nyou see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the\\nbadge of a society.”\\n\\n\\n“But of what society?”\\n\\n\\n“Have you never—” said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and\\nsinking his voice—“have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?”\\n\\n\\n“I never have.”\\n\\n\\nHolmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. “Here it\\nis,” said he presently:\\n\\n\\n“‘Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance\\nto the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was\\nformed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil\\nWar, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country,\\nnotably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power\\nwas used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the negro\\nvoters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed\\nto its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the\\nmarked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape—a sprig of\\noak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving\\nthis the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from\\nthe country. If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon\\nhim, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was the\\norganisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that there is\\nhardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity,\\nor in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. For some\\nyears the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States\\ngovernment and of the better classes of the community in the South. Eventually,\\nin the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have\\nbeen sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.’\\n\\n\\n“You will observe,” said Holmes, laying down the volume,\\n“that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the\\ndisappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been\\ncause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more\\nimplacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this register and\\ndiary may implicate some of the first men in the South, and that there may be\\nmany who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered.”\\n\\n\\n“Then the page we have seen—”\\n\\n\\n“Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, ‘sent the\\npips to A, B, and C’—that is, sent the society’s warning to\\nthem. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the\\ncountry, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C.\\nWell, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place, and I\\nbelieve that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I\\nhave told him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand\\nme over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable\\nweather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men.”\\n\\n\\nIt had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued\\nbrightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city. Sherlock\\nHolmes was already at breakfast when I came down.\\n\\n\\n“You will excuse me for not waiting for you,” said he; “I\\nhave, I foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young\\nOpenshaw’s.”\\n\\n\\n“What steps will you take?” I asked.\\n\\n\\n“It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may\\nhave to go down to Horsham, after all.”\\n\\n\\n“You will not go there first?”\\n\\n\\n“No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the maid will\\nbring up your coffee.”\\n\\n\\nAs I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye\\nover it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.\\n\\n\\n“Holmes,” I cried, “you are too late.”\\n\\n\\n“Ah!” said he, laying down his cup, “I feared as much. How\\nwas it done?” He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.\\n\\n\\n“My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading ‘Tragedy Near\\nWaterloo Bridge.’ Here is the account:\\n\\n\\n“‘Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of\\nthe H Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a splash\\nin the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in\\nspite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a\\nrescue. The alarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the\\nbody was eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman whose\\nname, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was John\\nOpenshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham. It is conjectured that he may\\nhave been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that\\nin his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the\\nedge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. The body\\nexhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased\\nhad been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of\\ncalling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside\\nlanding-stages.’”\\n\\n\\nWe sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken than I had\\never seen him.\\n\\n\\n“That hurts my pride, Watson,” he said at last. “It is a\\npetty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter\\nwith me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang.\\nThat he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to his\\ndeath—!” He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in\\nuncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous\\nclasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.\\n\\n\\n“They must be cunning devils,” he exclaimed at last. “How\\ncould they have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct\\nline to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a\\nnight, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in the long\\nrun. I am going out now!”\\n\\n\\n“To the police?”\\n\\n\\n“No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take the\\nflies, but not before.”\\n\\n\\nAll day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the evening\\nbefore I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come back yet. It\\nwas nearly ten o’clock before he entered, looking pale and worn. He\\nwalked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it\\nvoraciously, washing it down with a long draught of water.\\n\\n\\n“You are hungry,” I remarked.\\n\\n\\n“Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since\\nbreakfast.”\\n\\n\\n“Nothing?”\\n\\n\\n“Not a bite. I had no time to think of it.”\\n\\n\\n“And how have you succeeded?”\\n\\n\\n“Well.”\\n\\n\\n“You have a clue?”\\n\\n\\n“I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long\\nremain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon\\nthem. It is well thought of!”\\n\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\n\\nHe took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out\\nthe pips upon the table. Of these he took five and thrust them into an\\nenvelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote “S. H. for J. O.” Then\\nhe sealed it and addressed it to “Captain James Calhoun, Barque Lone\\nStar, Savannah, Georgia.”\\n\\n\\n“That will await him when he enters port,” said he, chuckling.\\n“It may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor\\nof his fate as Openshaw did before him.”\\n\\n\\n“And who is this Captain Calhoun?”\\n\\n\\n“The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.”\\n\\n\\n“How did you trace it, then?”\\n\\n\\nHe took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates and\\nnames.\\n\\n\\n“I have spent the whole day,” said he, “over Lloyd’s\\nregisters and files of the old papers, following the future career of every\\nvessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in ’83. There\\nwere thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those\\nmonths. Of these, one, the Lone Star, instantly attracted my attention,\\nsince, although it was reported as having cleared from London, the name is that\\nwhich is given to one of the states of the Union.”\\n\\n\\n“Texas, I think.”\\n\\n\\n“I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an\\nAmerican origin.”\\n\\n\\n“What then?”\\n\\n\\n“I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque Lone\\nStar was there in January, ’85, my suspicion became a certainty. I\\nthen inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of\\nLondon.”\\n\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\n\\n“The Lone Star had arrived here last week. I went down to the\\nAlbert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide\\nthis morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and learned that\\nshe had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly I have no doubt that\\nshe is now past the Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight.”\\n\\n\\n“What will you do, then?”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the\\nonly native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and Germans. I\\nknow, also, that they were all three away from the ship last night. I had it\\nfrom the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By the time that their\\nsailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and\\nthe cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these three gentlemen\\nare badly wanted here upon a charge of murder.”\\n\\n\\nThere is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the\\nmurderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would\\nshow them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves, was upon\\ntheir track. Very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year. We\\nwaited long for news of the Lone Star of Savannah, but none ever reached\\nus. We did at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a shattered\\nstern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave, with the\\nletters “L. S.” carved upon it, and that is all which we shall ever\\nknow of the fate of the Lone Star.\\n',\n",

We would not dare to conceive the things\\nwhich are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that\\nwindow hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and\\npeep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the\\nplannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through\\ngenerations, and leading to the most outrÃ© results, it would make all\\nfiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and\\nunprofitable.”\\n\\n\\n“And yet I am not convinced of it,” I answered. “The cases\\nwhich come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar\\nenough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and\\nyet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor\\nartistic.”\\n\\n\\n“A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic\\neffect,” remarked Holmes. “This is wanting in the police report,\\nwhere more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than\\nupon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole\\nmatter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the\\ncommonplace.”\\n\\n\\nI smiled and shook my head. “I can quite understand your thinking\\nso,” I said. “Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and\\nhelper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you\\nare brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But\\nhere”—I picked up the morning paper from the\\nground—“let us put it to a practical test. Here is the first\\nheading upon which I come. ‘A husband’s cruelty to his wife.’\\nThere is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all\\nperfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the\\npush, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of\\nwriters could invent nothing more crude.”\\n\\n\\n“Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,”\\nsaid Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. “This is the\\nDundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some\\nsmall points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no\\nother woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the\\nhabit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them\\nat his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the\\nimagination of the average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and\\nacknowledge that I have scored over you in your example.”\\n\\n\\nHe held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of\\nthe lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life\\nthat I could not help commenting upon it.\\n\\n\\n“Ah,” said he, “I forgot that I had not seen you for some\\nweeks. It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my\\nassistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers.”\\n\\n\\n“And the ring?” I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which\\nsparkled upon his finger.\\n\\n\\n“It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which I\\nserved them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who have\\nbeen good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems.”\\n\\n\\n“And have you any on hand just now?” I asked with interest.\\n\\n\\n“Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest. They\\nare important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed, I have found\\nthat it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the\\nobservation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the\\ncharm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the\\nbigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases,\\nsave for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from\\nMarseilles, there is nothing which presents any features of interest. It is\\npossible, however, that I may have something better before very many minutes\\nare over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.”\\n\\n\\nHe had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing\\ndown into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over his shoulder, I\\nsaw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur\\nboa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat\\nwhich was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear.\\nFrom under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at\\nour windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers\\nfidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who\\nleaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of\\nthe bell.\\n\\n\\n“I have seen those symptoms before,” said Holmes, throwing his\\ncigarette into the fire. “Oscillation upon the pavement always means an\\naffaire de cÅ\\x93ur. She would like advice, but is not sure that the matter\\nis not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may discriminate.\\nWhen a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and\\nthe usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a\\nlove matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved.\\nBut here she comes in person to resolve our doubts.”\\n\\n\\nAs he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to\\nannounce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small\\nblack figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock\\nHolmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and,\\nhaving closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in\\nthe minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.\\n\\n\\n“Do you not find,” he said, “that with your short sight it is\\na little trying to do so much typewriting?”\\n\\n\\n“I did at first,” she answered, “but now I know where the\\nletters are without looking.” Then, suddenly realising the full purport\\nof his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and\\nastonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. “You’ve heard\\nabout me, Mr. Holmes,” she cried, “else how could you know all\\nthat?”\\n\\n\\n“Never mind,” said Holmes, laughing; “it is my business to\\nknow things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not,\\nwhy should you come to consult me?”\\n\\n\\n“I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose\\nhusband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for\\ndead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I’m not rich,\\nbut still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that I\\nmake by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr.\\nHosmer Angel.”\\n\\n\\n“Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?” asked\\nSherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.\\n\\n\\nAgain a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary\\nSutherland. “Yes, I did bang out of the house,” she said,\\n“for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr.\\nWindibank—that is, my father—took it all. He would not go to the\\npolice, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and\\nkept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with\\nmy things and came right away to you.”\\n\\n\\n“Your father,” said Holmes, “your stepfather, surely, since\\nthe name is different.”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for\\nhe is only five years and two months older than myself.”\\n\\n\\n“And your mother is alive?”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn’t best pleased, Mr.\\nHolmes, when she married again so soon after father’s death, and a man\\nwho was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the\\nTottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother\\ncarried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her\\nsell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They\\ngot Â£ 4700 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn’t near as much as\\nfather could have got if he had been alive.”\\n\\n\\nI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and\\ninconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the\\ngreatest concentration of attention.\\n\\n\\n“Your own little income,” he asked, “does it come out of the\\nbusiness?”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in\\nAuckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4Â½ per cent. Two thousand five\\nhundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.”\\n\\n\\n“You interest me extremely,” said Holmes. “And since you draw\\nso large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no\\ndoubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a\\nsingle lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about Â£ 60.”\\n\\n\\n“I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that\\nas long as I live at home I don’t wish to be a burden to them, and so\\nthey have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of course,\\nthat is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter\\nand pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I\\nearn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from\\nfifteen to twenty sheets in a day.”\\n\\n\\n“You have made your position very clear to me,” said Holmes.\\n“This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as\\nbefore myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer\\nAngel.”\\n\\n\\nA flush stole over Miss Sutherland’s face, and she picked nervously at\\nthe fringe of her jacket. “I met him first at the gasfitters’\\nball,” she said. “They used to send father tickets when he was\\nalive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr.\\nWindibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would\\nget quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this\\ntime I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He\\nsaid the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father’s friends were\\nto be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple\\nplush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when\\nnothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but\\nwe went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was\\nthere I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\\n\\n\\n“I suppose,” said Holmes, “that when Mr. Windibank came back\\nfrom France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and\\nshrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman,\\nfor she would have her way.”\\n\\n\\n“I see. Then at the gasfitters’ ball you met, as I understand, a\\ngentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had\\ngot home all safe, and after that we met him—that is to say, Mr. Holmes,\\nI met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr.\\nHosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.”\\n\\n\\n“No?”\\n\\n\\n“Well, you know father didn’t like anything of the sort. He\\nwouldn’t have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a\\nwoman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to\\nmother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine\\nyet.”\\n\\n\\n“But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see\\nyou?”\\n\\n\\n“Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote\\nand said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had\\ngone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I took\\nthe letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know.”\\n\\n\\n“Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took.\\nHosmer—Mr. Angel—was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall\\nStreet—and—”\\n\\n\\n“What office?”\\n\\n\\n“That’s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don’t know.”\\n\\n\\n“Where did he live, then?”\\n\\n\\n“He slept on the premises.”\\n\\n\\n“And you don’t know his address?”\\n\\n\\n“No—except that it was Leadenhall Street.”\\n\\n\\n“Where did you address your letters, then?”\\n\\n\\n“To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He\\nsaid that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other\\nclerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like\\nhe did his, but he wouldn’t have that, for he said that when I wrote them\\nthey seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that\\nthe machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me,\\nMr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think of.”\\n\\n\\n“It was most suggestive,” said Holmes. “It has long been an\\naxiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you\\nremember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?”\\n\\n\\n“He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the\\nevening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very\\nretiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He’d had the\\nquinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him\\nwith a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was\\nalways well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine\\nare, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.”\\n\\n\\n“Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned to\\nFrance?”\\n\\n\\n“Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should\\nmarry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear,\\nwith my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be true\\nto him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign\\nof his passion. Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder\\nof him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began\\nto ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to\\ntell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I\\ndidn’t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his\\nleave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn’t want to do\\nanything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has\\nits French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the\\nwedding.”\\n\\n\\n“It missed him, then?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.”\\n\\n\\n“Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the\\nFriday. Was it to be in church?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour’s, near\\nKing’s Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras\\nHotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he put us\\nboth into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the\\nonly other cab in the street. We got to the church first, and when the\\nfour-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when\\nthe cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there! The cabman\\nsaid that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get\\nin with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen\\nor heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.”\\n\\n\\n“It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,” said\\nHolmes.\\n\\n\\n“Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the\\nmorning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that\\neven if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to\\nremember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner\\nor later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened\\nsince gives a meaning to it.”\\n\\n\\n“Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen\\ncatastrophe has occurred to him?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not\\nhave talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened.”\\n\\n\\n“But you have no notion as to what it could have been?”\\n\\n\\n“None.”\\n\\n\\n“One more question. How did your mother take the matter?”\\n\\n\\n“She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter\\nagain.”\\n\\n\\n“And your father? Did you tell him?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and\\nthat I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could anyone have\\nin bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had\\nborrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him,\\nthere might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and\\nnever would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened? And\\nwhy could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I\\ncan’t sleep a wink at night.” She pulled a little handkerchief out\\nof her muff and began to sob heavily into it.\\n\\n\\n“I shall glance into the case for you,” said Holmes, rising,\\n“and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the\\nweight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it\\nfurther. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he\\nhas done from your life.”\\n\\n\\n“Then you don’t think I’ll see him again?”\\n\\n\\n“I fear not.”\\n\\n\\n“Then what has happened to him?”\\n\\n\\n“You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate\\ndescription of him and any letters of his which you can spare.”\\n\\n\\n“I advertised for him in last Saturday’s Chronicle,”\\nsaid she. “Here is the slip and here are four letters from him.”\\n\\n\\n“Thank you. And your address?”\\n\\n\\n“No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.”\\n\\n\\n“Mr. Angel’s address you never had, I understand. Where is your\\nfather’s place of business?”\\n\\n\\n“He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of\\nFenchurch Street.”\\n\\n\\n“Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave the\\npapers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let the whole\\nincident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life.”\\n\\n\\n“You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true to\\nHosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back.”\\n\\n\\nFor all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something noble in\\nthe simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect. She laid her\\nlittle bundle of papers upon the table and went her way, with a promise to come\\nagain whenever she might be summoned.\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed\\ntogether, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward\\nto the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe,\\nwhich was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his\\nchair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of\\ninfinite languor in his face.\\n\\n\\n“Quite an interesting study, that maiden,” he observed. “I\\nfound her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is\\nrather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in\\nAndover in ’77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last\\nyear. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new\\nto me. But the maiden herself was most instructive.”\\n\\n\\n“You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to\\nme,” I remarked.\\n\\n\\n“Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and\\nso you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to realise the\\nimportance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues\\nthat may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that\\nwoman’s appearance? Describe it.”\\n\\n\\n“Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather\\nof a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a\\nfringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than\\ncoffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves\\nwere greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I\\ndidn’t observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general\\nair of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.”\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.\\n\\n\\n“’Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You\\nhave really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everything\\nof importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for\\ncolour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself\\nupon details. My first glance is always at a woman’s sleeve. In a man it\\nis perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this\\nwoman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing\\ntraces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses\\nagainst the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand\\ntype, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it\\nfarthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as\\nthis was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at\\neither side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting,\\nwhich seemed to surprise her.”\\n\\n\\n“It surprised me.”\\n\\n\\n“But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested on\\nglancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not\\nunlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly\\ndecorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two\\nlower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now,\\nwhen you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from\\nhome with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she\\ncame away in a hurry.”\\n\\n\\n“And what else?” I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my\\nfriend’s incisive reasoning.\\n\\n\\n“I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but\\nafter being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the\\nforefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were\\nstained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too\\ndeep. It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon\\nthe finger. All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back\\nto business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised description of\\nMr. Hosmer Angel?”\\n\\n\\nI held the little printed slip to the light. “Missing,” it said,\\n“on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About\\nfive ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a\\nlittle bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted\\nglasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in black\\nfrock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and grey Harris\\ntweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots. Known to have been\\nemployed in an office in Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing,” &c,\\n&c.\\n\\n\\n“That will do,” said Holmes. “As to the letters,” he\\ncontinued, glancing over them, “they are very commonplace. Absolutely no\\nclue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one\\nremarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.”\\n\\n\\n“They are typewritten,” I remarked.\\n\\n\\n“Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat little\\n‘Hosmer Angel’ at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no\\nsuperscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The point about\\nthe signature is very suggestive—in fact, we may call it\\nconclusive.”\\n\\n\\n“Of what?”\\n\\n\\n“My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon\\nthe case?”\\n\\n\\n“I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny\\nhis signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.”\\n\\n\\n“No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which\\nshould settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the\\nyoung lady’s stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meet\\nus here at six o’clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well that we\\nshould do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing\\nuntil the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon\\nthe shelf for the interim.”\\n\\n\\nI had had so many reasons to believe in my friend’s subtle powers of\\nreasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have some\\nsolid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the\\nsingular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known\\nhim to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler\\nphotograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four,\\nand the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt\\nthat it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.\\n\\n\\nI left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that\\nwhen I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands\\nall the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing\\nbridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.\\n\\n\\nA professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time,\\nand the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. It was not\\nuntil close upon six o’clock that I found myself free and was able to\\nspring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too\\nlate to assist at the dÃ©nouement of the little mystery. I found Sherlock\\nHolmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the\\nrecesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with\\nthe pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his\\nday in the chemical work which was so dear to him.\\n\\n\\n“Well, have you solved it?” I asked as I entered.\\n\\n\\n“Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.”\\n\\n\\n“No, no, the mystery!” I cried.\\n\\n\\n“Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There was\\nnever any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the\\ndetails are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no law, I fear,\\nthat can touch the scoundrel.”\\n\\n\\n“Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss\\nSutherland?”\\n\\n\\nThe question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lips\\nto reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door.\\n\\n\\n“This is the girl’s stepfather, Mr. James Windibank,” said\\nHolmes. “He has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come\\nin!”\\n\\n\\nThe man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of\\nage, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a\\npair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning\\nglance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a\\nslight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.\\n\\n\\n“Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank,” said Holmes. “I think\\nthat this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with\\nme for six o’clock?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own\\nmaster, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this\\nlittle matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in\\npublic. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very\\nexcitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily\\ncontrolled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind\\nyou so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not\\npleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a\\nuseless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?”\\n\\n\\n“On the contrary,” said Holmes quietly; “I have every reason\\nto believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\\n\\n\\nMr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. “I am\\ndelighted to hear it,” he said.\\n\\n\\n“It is a curious thing,” remarked Holmes, “that a typewriter\\nhas really quite as much individuality as a man’s handwriting. Unless\\nthey are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more\\nworn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in this note\\nof yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over\\nof the ‘e,’ and a slight defect in the tail of the ‘r.’\\nThere are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more\\nobvious.”\\n\\n\\n“We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no\\ndoubt it is a little worn,” our visitor answered, glancing keenly at\\nHolmes with his bright little eyes.\\n\\n\\n“And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr.\\nWindibank,” Holmes continued. “I think of writing another little\\nmonograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It is\\na subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have here four\\nletters which purport to come from the missing man. They are all typewritten.\\nIn each case, not only are the ‘e’s’ slurred and the\\n‘r’s’ tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my\\nmagnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have\\nalluded are there as well.”\\n\\n\\nMr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. “I cannot\\nwaste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,” he said.\\n“If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done\\nit.”\\n\\n\\n“Certainly,” said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the\\ndoor. “I let you know, then, that I have caught him!”\\n\\n\\n“What! where?” shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and\\nglancing about him like a rat in a trap.\\n\\n\\n“Oh, it won’t do—really it won’t,” said Holmes\\nsuavely. “There is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is\\nquite too transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it\\nwas impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That’s right! Sit\\ndown and let us talk it over.”\\n\\n\\nOur visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter of\\nmoisture on his brow. “It—it’s not actionable,” he\\nstammered.\\n\\n\\n“I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves, Windibank,\\nit was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came\\nbefore me. Now, let me just run over the course of events, and you will\\ncontradict me if I go wrong.”\\n\\n\\nThe man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, like\\none who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the\\nmantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking,\\nrather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.\\n\\n\\n“The man married a woman very much older than himself for her\\nmoney,” said he, “and he enjoyed the use of the money of the\\ndaughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people\\nin their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It\\nwas worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable\\ndisposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was\\nevident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she\\nwould not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of\\ncourse, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent\\nit? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to\\nseek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would\\nnot answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally\\nannounced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her\\nclever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head\\nthan to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised\\nhimself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a\\nmoustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an\\ninsinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl’s short\\nsight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making\\nlove himself.”\\n\\n\\n“It was only a joke at first,” groaned our visitor. “We never\\nthought that she would have been so carried away.”\\n\\n\\n“Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly\\ncarried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in\\nFrance, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She\\nwas flattered by the gentleman’s attentions, and the effect was increased\\nby the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call,\\nfor it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a\\nreal effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which\\nwould finally secure the girl’s affections from turning towards anyone\\nelse. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys\\nto France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the\\nbusiness to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent\\nimpression upon the young lady’s mind and prevent her from looking upon\\nany other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted\\nupon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something\\nhappening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss\\nSutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate,\\nthat for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man.\\nAs far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther,\\nhe conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a\\nfour-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr.\\nWindibank!”\\n\\n\\nOur visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been\\ntalking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face.\\n\\n\\n“It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “but if\\nyou are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who\\nare breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from the\\nfirst, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an\\naction for assault and illegal constraint.”\\n\\n\\n“The law cannot, as you say, touch you,” said Holmes, unlocking and\\nthrowing open the door, “yet there never was a man who deserved\\npunishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a\\nwhip across your shoulders. By Jove!” he continued, flushing up at the\\nsight of the bitter sneer upon the man’s face, “it is not part of\\nmy duties to my client, but here’s a hunting crop handy, and I think I\\nshall just treat myself to—” He took two swift steps to the whip,\\nbut before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs,\\nthe heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr. James\\nWindibank running at the top of his speed down the road.\\n\\n\\n“There’s a cold-blooded scoundrel!” said Holmes, laughing, as\\nhe threw himself down into his chair once more. “That fellow will rise\\nfrom crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows.\\nThe case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.”\\n\\n\\n“I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,” I\\nremarked.\\n\\n\\n“Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer Angel\\nmust have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear\\nthat the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see,\\nwas the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together, but\\nthat the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were\\nthe tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise,\\nas did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar\\naction in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his\\nhandwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest\\nsample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones,\\nall pointed in the same direction.”\\n\\n\\n“And how did you verify them?”\\n\\n\\n“Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew the\\nfirm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed description. I\\neliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise—the\\nwhiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request\\nthat they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of\\ntheir travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter,\\nand I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would\\ncome here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same\\ntrivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from\\nWesthouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description\\ntallied in every respect with that of their employÃ©, James Windibank. VoilÃ\\xa0\\ntout!”\\n\\n\\n“And Miss Sutherland?”\\n\\n\\n“If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old Persian\\nsaying, ‘There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger\\nalso for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.’ There is as much sense\\nin Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world.”\\n',\n",

       "  'body': ' I had\\ncalled upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year\\nand found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly\\ngentleman with fiery red hair. With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to\\nwithdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door\\nbehind me.\\n\\n\\n“You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear\\nWatson,” he said cordially.\\n\\n\\n“I was afraid that you were engaged.”\\n\\n\\n“So I am. Very much so.”\\n\\n\\n“Then I can wait in the next room.”\\n\\n\\n“Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper\\nin many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the\\nutmost use to me in yours also.”\\n\\n\\nThe stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a\\nquick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.\\n\\n\\n“Try the settee,” said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and\\nputting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods.\\n“I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre\\nand outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have\\nshown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle,\\nand, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own\\nlittle adventures.”\\n\\n\\n“Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,” I\\nobserved.\\n\\n\\n“You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went\\ninto the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for\\nstrange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which\\nis always far more daring than any effort of the imagination.”\\n\\n\\n“A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.”\\n\\n\\n“You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for\\notherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks\\ndown under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has\\nbeen good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which\\npromises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time.\\nYou have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very\\noften connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and\\noccasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime\\nhas been committed. As far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say\\nwhether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of\\nevents is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.\\nPerhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your\\nnarrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the\\nopening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious\\nto have every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some\\nslight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the\\nthousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. In the present\\ninstance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief,\\nunique.”\\n\\n\\nThe portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride\\nand pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his\\ngreatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust\\nforward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the\\nman and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications\\nwhich might be presented by his dress or appearance.\\n\\n\\nI did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore every\\nmark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and\\nslow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd’s check trousers, a not\\nover-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with\\na heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as\\nan ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet\\ncollar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was\\nnothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression\\nof extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes’ quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head\\nwith a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. “Beyond the obvious\\nfacts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he\\nis a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable\\namount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.”\\n\\n\\nMr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper,\\nbut his eyes upon my companion.\\n\\n\\n“How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr.\\nHolmes?” he asked. “How did you know, for example, that I did\\nmanual labour. It’s as true as gospel, for I began as a ship’s\\ncarpenter.”\\n\\n\\n“Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than\\nyour left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.”\\n\\n\\n“Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?”\\n\\n\\n“I won’t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,\\nespecially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an\\narc-and-compass breastpin.”\\n\\n\\n“Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?”\\n\\n\\n“What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five\\ninches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it\\nupon the desk?”\\n\\n\\n“Well, but China?”\\n\\n\\n“The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could\\nonly have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and\\nhave even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of staining\\nthe fishes’ scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When,\\nin addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter\\nbecomes even more simple.”\\n\\n\\nMr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. “Well, I never!” said he.\\n“I thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see that\\nthere was nothing in it after all.”\\n\\n\\n“I begin to think, Watson,” said Holmes, “that I make a\\nmistake in explaining. ‘Omne ignotum pro magnifico,’ you\\nknow, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I\\nam so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, I have got it now,” he answered with his thick red finger\\nplanted halfway down the column. “Here it is. This is what began it all.\\nYou just read it for yourself, sir.”\\n\\n\\nI took the paper from him and read as follows:\\n\\n\\n“TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah\\nHopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., there is now another vacancy open\\nwhich entitles a member of the League to a salary of Â£ 4 a week for purely\\nnominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above\\nthe age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at eleven\\no’clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope’s\\nCourt, Fleet Street.”\\n\\n\\n“What on earth does this mean?” I ejaculated after I had twice read\\nover the extraordinary announcement.\\n\\n\\nHolmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high\\nspirits. “It is a little off the beaten track, isn’t it?”\\nsaid he. “And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all\\nabout yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had\\nupon your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the\\ndate.”\\n\\n\\n“It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months\\nago.”\\n\\n\\n“Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?”\\n\\n\\n“Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,”\\nsaid Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; “I have a small\\npawnbroker’s business at Coburg Square, near the City. It’s not a\\nvery large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a\\nliving. I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and\\nI would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so\\nas to learn the business.”\\n\\n\\n“What is the name of this obliging youth?” asked Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\n\\n“His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he’s not such a youth, either.\\nIt’s hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr.\\nHolmes; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I\\nam able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas\\nin his head?”\\n\\n\\n“Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employÃ© who\\ncomes under the full market price. It is not a common experience among\\nemployers in this age. I don’t know that your assistant is not as\\nremarkable as your advertisement.”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, he has his faults, too,” said Mr. Wilson. “Never was\\nsuch a fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be\\nimproving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its\\nhole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on the whole\\nhe’s a good worker. There’s no vice in him.”\\n\\n\\n“He is still with you, I presume?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking\\nand keeps the place clean—that’s all I have in the house, for I am\\na widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three of us;\\nand we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.\\n\\n\\n“The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he\\ncame down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in\\nhis hand, and he says:\\n\\n\\n“‘I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed\\nman.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Why that?’ I asks.\\n\\n\\n“‘Why,’ says he, ‘here’s another vacancy on\\nthe League of the Red-headed Men. It’s worth quite a little fortune to\\nany man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there\\nare men, so that the trustees are at their wits’ end what to do with the\\nmoney. If my hair would only change colour, here’s a nice little crib all\\nready for me to step into.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Why, what is it, then?’ I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes,\\nI am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my\\nhaving to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the\\ndoor-mat. In that way I didn’t know much of what was going on outside,\\nand I was always glad of a bit of news.\\n\\n\\n“‘Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed\\nMen?’ he asked with his eyes open.\\n\\n\\n“‘Never.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for\\none of the vacancies.’\\n\\n\\n“‘And what are they worth?’ I asked.\\n\\n\\n“‘Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is\\nslight, and it need not interfere very much with one’s other\\noccupations.’\\n\\n\\n“Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the\\nbusiness has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred\\nwould have been very handy.\\n\\n\\n“‘Tell me all about it,’ said I.\\n\\n\\n“‘Well,’ said he, showing me the advertisement,\\n‘you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the\\naddress where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the\\nLeague was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very\\npeculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy\\nfor all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he had left his\\nenormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the\\ninterest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour.\\nFrom all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do.’\\n\\n\\n“‘But,’ said I, ‘there would be millions of\\nred-headed men who would apply.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Not so many as you might think,’ he answered.\\n‘You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This\\nAmerican had started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old\\ntown a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your\\nhair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery\\nred. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but\\nperhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for\\nthe sake of a few hundred pounds.’\\n\\n\\n“Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my\\nhair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was\\nto be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I\\nhad ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought\\nhe might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day\\nand to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we\\nshut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the\\nadvertisement.\\n\\n\\n“I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north,\\nsouth, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped\\ninto the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street was choked with\\nred-headed folk, and Pope’s Court looked like a coster’s orange\\nbarrow. I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as\\nwere brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they\\nwere—straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as\\nSpaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint.\\nWhen I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but\\nSpaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he\\npushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to\\nthe steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the stair,\\nsome going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well\\nas we could and soon found ourselves in the office.”\\n\\n\\n“Your experience has been a most entertaining one,” remarked Holmes\\nas his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.\\n“Pray continue your very interesting statement.”\\n\\n\\n“There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal\\ntable, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine.\\nHe said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed\\nto find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did\\nnot seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came\\nthe little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he\\nclosed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.\\n\\n\\n“‘This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,’ said my assistant,\\n‘and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.’\\n\\n\\n“‘And he is admirably suited for it,’ the other\\nanswered. ‘He has every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen\\nanything so fine.’ He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side,\\nand gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged\\nforward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.\\n\\n\\n“‘It would be injustice to hesitate,’ said he.\\n‘You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious\\nprecaution.’ With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged\\nuntil I yelled with the pain. ‘There is water in your eyes,’ said\\nhe as he released me. ‘I perceive that all is as it should be. But we\\nhave to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint.\\nI could tell you tales of cobbler’s wax which would disgust you with\\nhuman nature.’ He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at\\nthe top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment\\ncame up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until\\nthere was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.\\n\\n\\n“‘My name,’ said he, ‘is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I\\nam myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are\\nyou a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?’\\n\\n\\n“I answered that I had not.\\n\\n\\n“His face fell immediately.\\n\\n\\n“‘Dear me!’ he said gravely, ‘that is very\\nserious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for\\nthe propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance.\\nIt is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.’\\n\\n\\n“My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to\\nhave the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he\\nsaid that it would be all right.\\n\\n\\n“‘In the case of another,’ said he, ‘the\\nobjection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with\\nsuch a head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new\\nduties?’\\n\\n\\n“‘Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business\\nalready,’ said I.\\n\\n\\n“‘Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!’ said Vincent\\nSpaulding. ‘I should be able to look after that for you.’\\n\\n\\n“‘What would be the hours?’ I asked.\\n\\n\\n“‘Ten to two.’\\n\\n\\n“Now a pawnbroker’s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr.\\nHolmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day;\\nso it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. Besides, I knew\\nthat my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned\\nup.\\n\\n\\n“‘That would suit me very well,’ said I. ‘And the\\npay?’\\n\\n\\n“‘Is Â£ 4 a week.’\\n\\n\\n“‘And the work?’\\n\\n\\n“‘Is purely nominal.’\\n\\n\\n“‘What do you call purely nominal?’\\n\\n\\n“‘Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the\\nbuilding, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position\\nforever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don’t comply with\\nthe conditions if you budge from the office during that time.’\\n\\n\\n“‘It’s only four hours a day, and I should not think of\\nleaving,’ said I.\\n\\n\\n“‘No excuse will avail,’ said Mr. Duncan Ross;\\n‘neither sickness nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or\\nyou lose your billet.’\\n\\n\\n“‘And the work?’\\n\\n\\n“‘Is to copy out the EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica. There is the\\nfirst volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and\\nblotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready\\nto-morrow?’\\n\\n\\n“‘Certainly,’ I answered.\\n\\n\\n“‘Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate\\nyou once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to\\ngain.’ He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant,\\nhardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.\\n\\n\\n“Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low\\nspirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be\\nsome great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine.\\nIt seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that\\nthey would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the\\nEncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica. Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me\\nup, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in\\nthe morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny\\nbottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I\\nstarted off for Pope’s Court.\\n\\n\\n“Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible.\\nThe table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I\\ngot fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and then he left me;\\nbut he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. At\\ntwo o’clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I\\nhad written, and locked the door of the office after me.\\n\\n\\n“This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager came\\nin and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week’s work. It was the\\nsame next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I was there at ten,\\nand every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in\\nonly once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all.\\nStill, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not\\nsure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so\\nwell, that I would not risk the loss of it.\\n\\n\\n“Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and\\nArchery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence that I\\nmight get on to the B’s before very long. It cost me something in\\nfoolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. And then\\nsuddenly the whole business came to an end.”\\n\\n\\n“To an end?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual at\\nten o’clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of\\ncardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here it is, and\\nyou can read for yourself.”\\n\\n\\nHe held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper.\\nIt read in this fashion:\\n\\n\\n“THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED. October 9, 1890.”\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face\\nbehind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every\\nother consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.\\n\\n\\n“I cannot see that there is anything very funny,” cried our client,\\nflushing up to the roots of his flaming head. “If you can do nothing\\nbetter than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.”\\n\\n\\n“No, no,” cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which\\nhe had half risen. “I really wouldn’t miss your case for the world.\\nIt is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so,\\nsomething just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you\\nfound the card upon the door?”\\n\\n\\n“I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the\\noffices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I\\nwent to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground floor, and I\\nasked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He said\\nthat he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross\\nwas. He answered that the name was new to him.\\n\\n\\n“‘Well,’ said I, ‘the gentleman at No. 4.’\\n\\n\\n“‘What, the red-headed man?’\\n\\n\\n“‘Yes.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Oh,’ said he, ‘his name was William Morris. He\\nwas a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new\\npremises were ready. He moved out yesterday.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Where could I find him?’\\n\\n\\n“‘Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17\\nKing Edward Street, near St. Paul’s.’\\n\\n\\n“I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a\\nmanufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either\\nMr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.”\\n\\n\\n“And what did you do then?” asked Holmes.\\n\\n\\n“I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my\\nassistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I\\nwaited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I\\ndid not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that\\nyou were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came\\nright away to you.”\\n\\n\\n“And you did very wisely,” said Holmes. “Your case is an\\nexceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you\\nhave told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than\\nmight at first sight appear.”\\n\\n\\n“Grave enough!” said Mr. Jabez Wilson. “Why, I have lost four\\npound a week.”\\n\\n\\n“As far as you are personally concerned,” remarked Holmes, “I\\ndo not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On\\nthe contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some Â£ 30, to say nothing of\\nthe minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under\\nthe letter A. You have lost nothing by them.”\\n\\n\\n“No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what\\ntheir object was in playing this prank—if it was a prank—upon me.\\nIt was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty\\npounds.”\\n\\n\\n“We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one or\\ntwo questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called your\\nattention to the advertisement—how long had he been with you?”\\n\\n\\n“About a month then.”\\n\\n\\n“How did he come?”\\n\\n\\n“In answer to an advertisement.”\\n\\n\\n“Was he the only applicant?”\\n\\n\\n“No, I had a dozen.”\\n\\n\\n“Why did you pick him?”\\n\\n\\n“Because he was handy and would come cheap.”\\n\\n\\n“At half wages, in fact.”\\n\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n\\n“What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?”\\n\\n\\n“Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though\\nhe’s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his\\nforehead.”\\n\\n\\nHolmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. “I thought as\\nmuch,” said he. “Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced\\nfor earrings?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a\\nlad.”\\n\\n\\n“Hum!” said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. “He is\\nstill with you?”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.”\\n\\n\\n“And has your business been attended to in your absence?”\\n\\n\\n“Nothing to complain of, sir. There’s never very much to do of a\\nmorning.”\\n\\n\\n“That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon\\nthe subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that\\nby Monday we may come to a conclusion.”\\n\\n\\n“Well, Watson,” said Holmes when our visitor had left us,\\n“what do you make of it all?”\\n\\n\\n“I make nothing of it,” I answered frankly. “It is a most\\nmysterious business.”\\n\\n\\n“As a rule,” said Holmes, “the more bizarre a thing is the\\nless mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes\\nwhich are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to\\nidentify. But I must be prompt over this matter.”\\n\\n\\n“What are you going to do, then?” I asked.\\n\\n\\n“To smoke,” he answered. “It is quite a three pipe problem,\\nand I beg that you won’t speak to me for fifty minutes.” He curled\\nhimself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose,\\nand there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out\\nlike the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had\\ndropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of\\nhis chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe\\ndown upon the mantelpiece.\\n\\n\\n“Sarasate plays at the St. James’s Hall this afternoon,” he\\nremarked. “What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a\\nfew hours?”\\n\\n\\n“I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.”\\n\\n\\n“Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and we\\ncan have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal of German\\nmusic on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or\\nFrench. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!”\\n\\n\\nWe travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us\\nto Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to\\nin the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines\\nof dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure,\\nwhere a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard\\nfight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a\\nbrown board with “JABEZ WILSON” in white letters, upon a corner\\nhouse, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business.\\nSherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it\\nall over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked\\nslowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly\\nat the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker’s, and, having\\nthumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went\\nup to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking,\\nclean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.\\n\\n\\n“Thank you,” said Holmes, “I only wished to ask you how you\\nwould go from here to the Strand.”\\n\\n\\n“Third right, fourth left,” answered the assistant promptly,\\nclosing the door.\\n\\n\\n“Smart fellow, that,” observed Holmes as we walked away. “He\\nis, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not\\nsure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him\\nbefore.”\\n\\n\\n“Evidently,” said I, “Mr. Wilson’s assistant counts for\\na good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you\\ninquired your way merely in order that you might see him.”\\n\\n\\n“Not him.”\\n\\n\\n“What then?”\\n\\n\\n“The knees of his trousers.”\\n\\n\\n“And what did you see?”\\n\\n\\n“What I expected to see.”\\n\\n\\n“Why did you beat the pavement?”\\n\\n\\n“My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are\\nspies in an enemy’s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let\\nus now explore the parts which lie behind it.”\\n\\n\\nThe road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the\\nretired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of\\na picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the\\ntraffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the\\nimmense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while\\nthe footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was\\ndifficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately\\nbusiness premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and\\nstagnant square which we had just quitted.\\n\\n\\n“Let me see,” said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing\\nalong the line, “I should like just to remember the order of the houses\\nhere. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is\\nMortimer’s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch\\nof the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane’s\\ncarriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now,\\nDoctor, we’ve done our work, so it’s time we had some play. A\\nsandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is\\nsweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex\\nus with their conundrums.”\\n\\n\\nMy friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable\\nperformer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he sat in the\\nstalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin\\nfingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid,\\ndreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the\\nrelentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to\\nconceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted\\nitself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often\\nthought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which\\noccasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme\\nlanguor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly\\nformidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid\\nhis improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of\\nthe chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power\\nwould rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with\\nhis methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that\\nof other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at\\nSt. James’s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom\\nhe had set himself to hunt down.\\n\\n\\n“You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,” he remarked as we emerged.\\n\\n\\n“Yes, it would be as well.”\\n\\n\\n“And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This business\\nat Coburg Square is serious.”\\n\\n\\n“Why serious?”\\n\\n\\n“A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe\\nthat we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather\\ncomplicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.”\\n\\n\\n“At what time?”\\n\\n\\n“Ten will be early enough.”\\n\\n\\n“I shall be at Baker Street at ten.”\\n\\n\\n“Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so\\nkindly put your army revolver in your pocket.” He waved his hand, turned\\non his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.\\n\\n\\nI trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed\\nwith a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I\\nhad heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his\\nwords it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what\\nwas about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and\\ngrotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all,\\nfrom the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the\\nEncyclopÃ¦dia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous\\nwords with which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and\\nwhy should I go armed? Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the\\nhint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker’s assistant was a\\nformidable man—a man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it\\nout, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should\\nbring an explanation.\\n\\n\\nIt was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way across the\\nPark, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms were standing\\nat the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from\\nabove. On entering his room, I found Holmes in animated conversation with two\\nmen, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while\\nthe other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and\\noppressively respectable frock-coat.\\n\\n\\n“Ha! Our party is complete,” said Holmes, buttoning up his\\npea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. “Watson, I\\nthink you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr.\\nMerryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night’s adventure.”\\n\\n\\n“We’re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,” said Jones\\nin his consequential way. “Our friend here is a wonderful man for\\nstarting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running\\ndown.”\\n\\n\\n“I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,”\\nobserved Mr. Merryweather gloomily.\\n\\n\\n“You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,” said\\nthe police agent loftily. “He has his own little methods, which are, if\\nhe won’t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic,\\nbut he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say that\\nonce or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure,\\nhe has been more nearly correct than the official force.”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,” said the stranger\\nwith deference. “Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first\\nSaturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber.”\\n\\n\\n“I think you will find,” said Sherlock Holmes, “that you will\\nplay for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play\\nwill be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be some Â£\\n30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your\\nhands.”\\n\\n\\n“John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He’s a young\\nman, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would\\nrather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He’s a\\nremarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he\\nhimself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers,\\nand though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the\\nman himself. He’ll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising\\nmoney to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I’ve been on his track\\nfor years and have never set eyes on him yet.”\\n\\n\\n“I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night.\\nI’ve had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree\\nwith you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however, and\\nquite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I\\nwill follow in the second.”\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back\\nin the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. We rattled\\nthrough an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into\\nFarrington Street.\\n\\n\\n“We are close there now,” my friend remarked. “This fellow\\nMerryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I\\nthought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though\\nan absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as\\nbrave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon\\nanyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.”\\n\\n\\nWe had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in\\nthe morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr.\\nMerryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he\\nopened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive\\niron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps,\\nwhich terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light\\na lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so,\\nafter opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all\\nround with crates and massive boxes.\\n\\n\\n“You are not very vulnerable from above,” Holmes remarked as he\\nheld up the lantern and gazed about him.\\n\\n\\n“Nor from below,” said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon\\nthe flags which lined the floor. “Why, dear me, it sounds quite\\nhollow!” he remarked, looking up in surprise.\\n\\n\\n“I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!” said Holmes\\nseverely. “You have already imperilled the whole success of our\\nexpedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one\\nof those boxes, and not to interfere?”\\n\\n\\nThe solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured\\nexpression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and,\\nwith the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks\\nbetween the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his\\nfeet again and put his glass in his pocket.\\n\\n\\n“We have at least an hour before us,” he remarked, “for they\\ncan hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they\\nwill not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they\\nwill have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor—as no doubt you\\nhave divined—in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal\\nLondon banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will\\nexplain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London\\nshould take a considerable interest in this cellar at present.”\\n\\n\\n“It is our French gold,” whispered the director. “We have had\\nseveral warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.”\\n\\n\\n“Your French gold?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and\\nborrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has\\nbecome known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it\\nis still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000\\nnapoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much\\nlarger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the\\ndirectors have had misgivings upon the subject.”\\n\\n\\n“Which were very well justified,” observed Holmes. “And now\\nit is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour\\nmatters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the\\nscreen over that dark lantern.”\\n\\n\\n“And sit in the dark?”\\n\\n\\n“I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I\\nthought that, as we were a partie carrÃ©e, you might have your rubber\\nafter all. But I see that the enemy’s preparations have gone so far that\\nwe cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our\\npositions. These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a\\ndisadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand\\nbehind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I\\nflash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no\\ncompunction about shooting them down.”\\n\\n\\nI placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I\\ncrouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in\\npitch darkness—such an absolute darkness as I have never before\\nexperienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was\\nstill there, ready to flash out at a moment’s notice. To me, with my\\nnerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and\\nsubduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.\\n\\n\\n“They have but one retreat,” whispered Holmes. “That is back\\nthrough the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I\\nasked you, Jones?”\\n\\n\\n“I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.”\\n\\n\\n“Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and\\nwait.”\\n\\n\\nWhat a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a\\nquarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone, and the\\ndawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to\\nchange my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of\\ntension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle\\nbreathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier\\nin-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director.\\nFrom my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor.\\nSuddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.\\n\\n\\nAt first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened\\nout until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a\\ngash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which\\nfelt about in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the\\nhand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was\\nwithdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single\\nlurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.\\n\\n\\nIts disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing sound,\\none of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square,\\ngaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there\\npeeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a\\nhand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high,\\nuntil one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of\\nthe hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself,\\nwith a pale face and a shock of very red hair.\\n\\n\\n“It’s all clear,” he whispered. “Have you the chisel\\nand the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I’ll swing for\\nit!”\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. The other\\ndived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched\\nat his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but\\nHolmes’ hunting crop came down on the man’s wrist, and the pistol\\nclinked upon the stone floor.\\n\\n\\n“It’s no use, John Clay,” said Holmes blandly. “You\\nhave no chance at all.”\\n\\n\\n“So I see,” the other answered with the utmost coolness. “I\\nfancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his\\ncoat-tails.”\\n\\n\\n“There are three men waiting for him at the door,” said Holmes.\\n\\n\\n“Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must\\ncompliment you.”\\n\\n\\n“And I you,” Holmes answered. “Your red-headed idea was very\\nnew and effective.”\\n\\n\\n“You’ll see your pal again presently,” said Jones.\\n“He’s quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while\\nI fix the derbies.”\\n\\n\\n“I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,” remarked\\nour prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. “You may not be\\naware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also, when you\\naddress me always to say ‘sir’ and\\n‘please.’”\\n\\n\\n“All right,” said Jones with a stare and a snigger. “Well,\\nwould you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your\\nHighness to the police-station?”\\n\\n\\n“That is better,” said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow\\nto the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.\\n\\n\\n“Really, Mr. Holmes,” said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them\\nfrom the cellar, “I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you.\\nThere is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete\\nmanner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come\\nwithin my experience.”\\n\\n\\n“I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John\\nClay,” said Holmes. “I have been at some small expense over this\\nmatter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply\\nrepaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing\\nthe very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.”\\n\\n\\n“You see, Watson,” he explained in the early hours of the morning\\nas we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, “it was\\nperfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather\\nfantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the\\nEncyclopÃ¦dia, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the\\nway for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but,\\nreally, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt\\nsuggested to Clay’s ingenious mind by the colour of his\\naccomplice’s hair. The Â£ 4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and\\nwhat was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the\\nadvertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the\\nman to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every\\nmorning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come\\nfor half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for\\nsecuring the situation.”\\n\\n\\n“But how could you guess what the motive was?”\\n\\n\\n“Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar\\nintrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man’s business was\\na small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such\\nelaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then,\\nbe something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the\\nassistant’s fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the\\ncellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made\\ninquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one\\nof the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in\\nthe cellar—something which took many hours a day for months on end. What\\ncould it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a\\ntunnel to some other building.\\n\\n\\n“So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised\\nyou by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the\\ncellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the\\nbell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes,\\nbut we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face.\\nHis knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn,\\nwrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The\\nonly remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round the\\ncorner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend’s premises,\\nand felt that I had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I\\ncalled upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the\\nresult that you have seen.”\\n\\n\\n“And how could you tell that they would make their attempt\\nto-night?” I asked.\\n\\n\\n“Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they\\ncared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson’s presence—in other words,\\nthat they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should use\\nit soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturday\\nwould suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for\\ntheir escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night.”\\n\\n\\n“You reasoned it out beautifully,” I exclaimed in unfeigned\\nadmiration. “It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.”\\n\\n\\n“It saved me from ennui,” he answered, yawning. “Alas! I\\nalready feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to\\nescape from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do\\nso.”\\n\\n\\n“And you are a benefactor of the race,” said I.\\n\\n\\nHe shrugged his shoulders. “Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some\\nlittle use,” he remarked. “‘L’homme\\nc’est rien—l’Å\\x93uvre c’est tout,’ as Gustave\\nFlaubert wrote to George Sand.”\\n',\n",

       "  'body': '\\nI had called upon my\\nfriend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, with the\\nintention of wishing him the compliments of the season. He was lounging upon\\nthe sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the\\nright, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at\\nhand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a\\nvery seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked\\nin several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair\\nsuggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of\\nexamination.\\n\\n\\n“You are engaged,” said I; “perhaps I interrupt you.”\\n\\n\\n“Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my\\nresults. The matter is a perfectly trivial one”—he jerked his thumb\\nin the direction of the old hat—“but there are points in connection\\nwith it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of\\ninstruction.”\\n\\n\\nI seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire,\\nfor a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystals.\\n“I suppose,” I remarked, “that, homely as it looks, this\\nthing has some deadly story linked on to it—that it is the clue which\\nwill guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some\\ncrime.”\\n\\n\\n“No, no. No crime,” said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. “Only one\\nof those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four\\nmillion human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square\\nmiles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every\\npossible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a little\\nproblem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being\\ncriminal. We have already had experience of such.”\\n\\n\\n“So much so,” I remarked, “that of the last six cases which I\\nhave added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal\\ncrime.”\\n\\n\\n“Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers,\\nto the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man\\nwith the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small matter will fall\\ninto the same innocent category. You know Peterson, the commissionaire?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n\\n“It is to him that this trophy belongs.”\\n\\n\\n“It is his hat.”\\n\\n\\n“No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look upon\\nit not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem. And, first, as\\nto how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning, in company with a good\\nfat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of\\nPeterson’s fire. The facts are these: about four o’clock on\\nChristmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was\\nreturning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down\\nTottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man,\\nwalking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over his\\nshoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between\\nthis stranger and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the\\nman’s hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging\\nit over his head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed\\nforward to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at\\nhaving broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniform\\nrushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid\\nthe labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road.\\nThe roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in\\npossession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the\\nshape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose.”\\n\\n\\n“Which surely he restored to their owner?”\\n\\n\\n“My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that ‘For Mrs.\\nHenry Baker’ was printed upon a small card which was tied to the\\nbird’s left leg, and it is also true that the initials ‘H.\\nB.’ are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some\\nthousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it\\nis not easy to restore lost property to any one of them.”\\n\\n\\n“What, then, did Peterson do?”\\n\\n\\n“He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning, knowing\\nthat even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The goose we retained\\nuntil this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the slight frost,\\nit would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder\\nhas carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while\\nI continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas\\ndinner.”\\n\\n\\n“Did he not advertise?”\\n\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n\\n“Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?”\\n\\n\\n“Only as much as we can deduce.”\\n\\n\\n“From his hat?”\\n\\n\\n“Precisely.”\\n\\n\\n“But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered\\nfelt?”\\n\\n\\n“Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as to\\nthe individuality of the man who has worn this article?”\\n\\n\\nI took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. It\\nwas a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the worse\\nfor wear. The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured.\\nThere was no maker’s name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials\\n“H. B.” were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for\\na hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was cracked,\\nexceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have\\nbeen some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.\\n\\n\\n“I can see nothing,” said I, handing it back to my friend.\\n\\n\\n“On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to\\nreason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences.”\\n\\n\\n“Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?”\\n\\n\\nHe picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was\\ncharacteristic of him. “It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have\\nbeen,” he remarked, “and yet there are a few inferences which are\\nvery distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of\\nprobability. That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the\\nface of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years,\\nalthough he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less now\\nthan formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the\\ndecline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink,\\nat work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has\\nceased to love him.”\\n\\n\\n“My dear Holmes!”\\n\\n\\n“He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,” he\\ncontinued, disregarding my remonstrance. “He is a man who leads a\\nsedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged,\\nhas grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he\\nanoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are to be\\ndeduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he\\nhas gas laid on in his house.”\\n\\n\\n“You are certainly joking, Holmes.”\\n\\n\\n“Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these\\nresults, you are unable to see how they are attained?”\\n\\n\\n“I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am\\nunable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was\\nintellectual?”\\n\\n\\nFor answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the\\nforehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. “It is a question of\\ncubic capacity,” said he; “a man with so large a brain must have\\nsomething in it.”\\n\\n\\n“The decline of his fortunes, then?”\\n\\n\\n“This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came in\\nthen. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and\\nthe excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three\\nyears ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the\\nworld.”\\n\\n\\n“Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and\\nthe moral retrogression?”\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes laughed. “Here is the foresight,” said he putting\\nhis finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. “They are\\nnever sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount\\nof foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the\\nwind. But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to\\nreplace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which\\nis a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he has\\nendeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with\\nink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.”\\n\\n\\n“Your reasoning is certainly plausible.”\\n\\n\\n“The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled,\\nthat it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be\\ngathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens\\ndiscloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber.\\nThey all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream.\\nThis dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the\\nfluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most\\nof the time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive\\nthat the wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the\\nbest of training.”\\n\\n\\n“But his wife—you said that she had ceased to love him.”\\n\\n\\n“This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson,\\nwith a week’s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife\\nallows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been\\nunfortunate enough to lose your wife’s affection.”\\n\\n\\n“But he might be a bachelor.”\\n\\n\\n“Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife.\\nRemember the card upon the bird’s leg.”\\n\\n\\n“You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that\\nthe gas is not laid on in his house?”\\n\\n\\n“One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no\\nless than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must\\nbe brought into frequent contact with burning tallow—walks upstairs at\\nnight probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other.\\nAnyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?”\\n\\n\\n“Well, it is very ingenious,” said I, laughing; “but since,\\nas you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save\\nthe loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.”\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and\\nPeterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and\\nthe face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.\\n\\n\\n“The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!” he gasped.\\n\\n\\n“Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off through\\nthe kitchen window?” Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a\\nfairer view of the man’s excited face.\\n\\n\\n“See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!” He held out\\nhis hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating\\nblue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance\\nthat it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand.\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. “By Jove, Peterson!” said\\nhe, “this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have\\ngot?”\\n\\n\\n“A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were\\nputty.”\\n\\n\\n“It’s more than a precious stone. It is the precious\\nstone.”\\n\\n\\n“Not the Countess of Morcar’s blue carbuncle!” I ejaculated.\\n\\n\\n“Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have\\nread the advertisement about it in The Times every day lately. It is\\nabsolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward\\noffered of Â£ 1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market\\nprice.”\\n\\n\\n“A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!” The commissionaire\\nplumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.\\n\\n\\n“That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are sentimental\\nconsiderations in the background which would induce the Countess to part with\\nhalf her fortune if she could but recover the gem.”\\n\\n\\n“It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan,” I\\nremarked.\\n\\n\\n“Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, a\\nplumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady’s jewel-case.\\nThe evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the\\nAssizes. I have some account of the matter here, I believe.” He rummaged\\namid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one\\nout, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:\\n\\n\\n“Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was brought\\nup upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted from the\\njewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue\\ncarbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the\\neffect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess of\\nMorcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar\\nof the grate, which was loose. He had remained with Horner some little time,\\nbut had finally been called away. On returning, he found that Horner had\\ndisappeared, that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco\\ncasket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to\\nkeep her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly gave\\nthe alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be\\nfound either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to the\\nCountess, deposed to having heard Ryder’s cry of dismay on discovering\\nthe robbery, and to having rushed into the room, where she found matters as\\ndescribed by the last witness. Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence\\nas to the arrest of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his\\ninnocence in the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery\\nhaving been given against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal\\nsummarily with the offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had\\nshown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the\\nconclusion and was carried out of court.”\\n\\n\\n“Hum! So much for the police-court,” said Holmes thoughtfully,\\ntossing aside the paper. “The question for us now to solve is the\\nsequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a\\ngoose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our little\\ndeductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent\\naspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came\\nfrom Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other\\ncharacteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set ourselves very\\nseriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in\\nthis little mystery. To do this, we must try the simplest means first, and\\nthese lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this\\nfail, I shall have recourse to other methods.”\\n\\n\\n“What will you say?”\\n\\n\\n“Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: ‘Found at the\\ncorner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can have\\nthe same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker Street.’ That is\\nclear and concise.”\\n\\n\\n“Very. But will he see it?”\\n\\n\\n“Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the\\nloss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the\\nwindow and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of nothing but flight,\\nbut since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to\\ndrop his bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see\\nit, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are,\\nPeterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening\\npapers.”\\n\\n\\n“In which, sir?”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St.\\nJames’s Gazette, Evening News, Standard, Echo,\\nand any others that occur to you.”\\n\\n\\n“Very well, sir. And this stone?”\\n\\n\\n“Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson, just\\nbuy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must have one to\\ngive to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now\\ndevouring.”\\n\\n\\nWhen the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it against\\nthe light. “It’s a bonny thing,” said he. “Just see how\\nit glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. Every\\ngood stone is. They are the devil’s pet baits. In the larger and older\\njewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty\\nyears old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is\\nremarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is\\nblue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has already a\\nsinister history. There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide,\\nand several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of\\ncrystallised charcoal. Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor\\nto the gallows and the prison? I’ll lock it up in my strong box now and\\ndrop a line to the Countess to say that we have it.”\\n\\n\\n“Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?”\\n\\n\\n“I cannot tell.”\\n\\n\\n“Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had\\nanything to do with the matter?”\\n\\n\\n“It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely\\ninnocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of\\nconsiderably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That, however, I\\nshall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our\\nadvertisement.”\\n\\n\\n“And you can do nothing until then?”\\n\\n\\n“Nothing.”\\n\\n\\n“In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come\\nback in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like to see\\nthe solution of so tangled a business.”\\n\\n\\n“Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe.\\nBy the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson\\nto examine its crop.”\\n\\n\\nI had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six when I\\nfound myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached the house I saw a tall\\nman in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting\\noutside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I\\narrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to Holmes’\\nroom.\\n\\n\\n“Mr. Henry Baker, I believe,” said he, rising from his armchair and\\ngreeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily\\nassume. “Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is a cold night,\\nand I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter.\\nAh, Watson, you have just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr.\\nBaker?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.”\\n\\n\\nHe was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad,\\nintelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A touch of\\nred in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled\\nHolmes’ surmise as to his habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned\\nright up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded\\nfrom his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato\\nfashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the impression generally of a\\nman of learning and letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.\\n\\n\\n“We have retained these things for some days,” said Holmes,\\n“because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your\\naddress. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise.”\\n\\n\\nOur visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. “Shillings have not been so\\nplentiful with me as they once were,” he remarked. “I had no doubt\\nthat the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the\\nbird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering\\nthem.”\\n\\n\\n“Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat\\nit.”\\n\\n\\n“To eat it!” Our visitor half rose from his chair in his\\nexcitement.\\n\\n\\n“Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I\\npresume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same\\nweight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, certainly, certainly,” answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of\\nrelief.\\n\\n\\n“Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own\\nbird, so if you wish—”\\n\\n\\nThe man burst into a hearty laugh. “They might be useful to me as relics\\nof my adventure,” said he, “but beyond that I can hardly see what\\nuse the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me.\\nNo, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to\\nthe excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.”\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his\\nshoulders.\\n\\n\\n“There is your hat, then, and there your bird,” said he. “By\\nthe way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am\\nsomewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose.”\\n\\n\\n“Certainly, sir,” said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly\\ngained property under his arm. “There are a few of us who frequent the\\nAlpha Inn, near the Museum—we are to be found in the Museum itself during\\nthe day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted\\na goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were\\neach to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest is\\nfamiliar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted\\nneither to my years nor my gravity.” With a comical pomposity of manner\\nhe bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way.\\n\\n\\n“So much for Mr. Henry Baker,” said Holmes when he had closed the\\ndoor behind him. “It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever\\nabout the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?”\\n\\n\\n“Not particularly.”\\n\\n\\n“Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this\\nclue while it is still hot.”\\n\\n\\n“By all means.”\\n\\n\\nIt was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our\\nthroats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and the\\nbreath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots. Our\\nfootfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors’\\nquarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into\\nOxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn,\\nwhich is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs\\ndown into Holborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered\\ntwo glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.\\n\\n\\n“Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,”\\nsaid he.\\n\\n\\n“My geese!” The man seemed surprised.\\n\\n\\n“Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was a\\nmember of your goose club.”\\n\\n\\n“Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them’s not our\\ngeese.”\\n\\n\\n“Indeed! Whose, then?”\\n\\n\\n“Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.”\\n\\n\\n“Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?”\\n\\n\\n“Breckinridge is his name.”\\n\\n\\n“Ah! I don’t know him. Well, here’s your good health\\nlandlord, and prosperity to your house. Good-night.”\\n\\n\\n“Now for Mr. Breckinridge,” he continued, buttoning up his coat as\\nwe came out into the frosty air. “Remember, Watson that though we have so\\nhomely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the other a man\\nwho will certainly get seven years’ penal servitude unless we can\\nestablish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his\\nguilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation which has been missed\\nby the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us\\nfollow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and quick\\nmarch!”\\n\\n\\nWe passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag of slums\\nto Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the name of\\nBreckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man, with a sharp\\nface and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters.\\n\\n\\n“Good-evening. It’s a cold night,” said Holmes.\\n\\n\\nThe salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.\\n\\n\\n“Sold out of geese, I see,” continued Holmes, pointing at the bare\\nslabs of marble.\\n\\n\\n“Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning.”\\n\\n\\n“That’s no good.”\\n\\n\\n“Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.”\\n\\n\\n“Ah, but I was recommended to you.”\\n\\n\\n“Who by?”\\n\\n\\n“The landlord of the Alpha.”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.”\\n\\n\\n“Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?”\\n\\n\\nTo my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.\\n\\n\\n“Now, then, mister,” said he, with his head cocked and his arms\\nakimbo, “what are you driving at? Let’s have it straight,\\nnow.”\\n\\n\\n“It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese\\nwhich you supplied to the Alpha.”\\n\\n\\n“Well then, I shan’t tell you. So now!”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don’t know why you\\nshould be so warm over such a trifle.”\\n\\n\\n“Warm! You’d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am.\\nWhen I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the\\nbusiness; but it’s ‘Where are the geese?’ and ‘Who did\\nyou sell the geese to?’ and ‘What will you take for the\\ngeese?’ One would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear\\nthe fuss that is made over them.”\\n\\n\\n“Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making\\ninquiries,” said Holmes carelessly. “If you won’t tell us the\\nbet is off, that is all. But I’m always ready to back my opinion on a\\nmatter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country\\nbred.”\\n\\n\\n“Well, then, you’ve lost your fiver, for it’s town\\nbred,” snapped the salesman.\\n\\n\\n“It’s nothing of the kind.”\\n\\n\\n“I say it is.”\\n\\n\\n“I don’t believe it.”\\n\\n\\n“D’you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled\\nthem ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the\\nAlpha were town bred.”\\n\\n\\n“You’ll never persuade me to believe that.”\\n\\n\\n“Will you bet, then?”\\n\\n\\n“It’s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But\\nI’ll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be\\nobstinate.”\\n\\n\\nThe salesman chuckled grimly. “Bring me the books, Bill,” said he.\\n\\n\\nThe small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one,\\nlaying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.\\n\\n\\n“Now then, Mr. Cocksure,” said the salesman, “I thought that\\nI was out of geese, but before I finish you’ll find that there is still\\none left in my shop. You see this little book?”\\n\\n\\n“Well?”\\n\\n\\n“That’s the list of the folk from whom I buy. D’you see?\\nWell, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their\\nnames are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then! You see this\\nother page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town suppliers. Now, look at\\nthat third name. Just read it out to me.”\\n\\n\\n“Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road—249,” read Holmes.\\n\\n\\n“Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.”\\n\\n\\nHolmes turned to the page indicated. “Here you are, ‘Mrs. Oakshott,\\n117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.’”\\n\\n\\n“Now, then, what’s the last entry?”\\n\\n\\n“‘December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s.\\n6d.’”\\n\\n\\n“Quite so. There you are. And underneath?”\\n\\n\\n“‘Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at\\n12s.’”\\n\\n\\n“What have you to say now?”\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his pocket\\nand threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man whose\\ndisgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post and\\nlaughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him.\\n\\n\\n“When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the ‘Pink\\n’un’ protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a\\nbet,” said he. “I daresay that if I had put Â£ 100 down in front of\\nhim, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn\\nfrom him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I\\nfancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be\\ndetermined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or\\nwhether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what that surly\\nfellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the\\nmatter, and I should—”\\n\\n\\nHis remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the\\nstall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow\\nstanding in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the\\nswinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his\\nstall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.\\n\\n\\n“I’ve had enough of you and your geese,” he shouted. “I\\nwish you were all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with\\nyour silly talk I’ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and\\nI’ll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese off\\nyou?”\\n\\n\\n“No; but one of them was mine all the same,” whined the little man.\\n\\n\\n“Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.”\\n\\n\\n“She told me to ask you.”\\n\\n\\n“Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I’ve had\\nenough of it. Get out of this!” He rushed fiercely forward, and the\\ninquirer flitted away into the darkness.\\n\\n\\n“Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,” whispered Holmes.\\n“Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.”\\nStriding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring\\nstalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the\\nshoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige\\nof colour had been driven from his face.\\n\\n\\n“Who are you, then? What do you want?” he asked in a quavering\\nvoice.\\n\\n\\n“You will excuse me,” said Holmes blandly, “but I could not\\nhelp overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I think\\nthat I could be of assistance to you.”\\n\\n\\n“You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?”\\n\\n\\n“My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people\\ndon’t know.”\\n\\n\\n“But you can know nothing of this?”\\n\\n\\n“Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to trace some\\ngeese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman named\\nBreckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his\\nclub, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,” cried\\nthe little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. “I can\\nhardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.”\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. “In that case we\\nhad better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept\\nmarket-place,” said he. “But pray tell me, before we go farther,\\nwho it is that I have the pleasure of assisting.”\\n\\n\\nThe man hesitated for an instant. “My name is John Robinson,” he\\nanswered with a sidelong glance.\\n\\n\\n“No, no; the real name,” said Holmes sweetly. “It is always\\nawkward doing business with an alias.”\\n\\n\\nA flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. “Well then,”\\nsaid he, “my real name is James Ryder.”\\n\\n\\n“Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into\\nthe cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish\\nto know.”\\n\\n\\nThe little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened,\\nhalf-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a\\nwindfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour\\nwe were back in the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during\\nour drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and the claspings\\nand unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.\\n\\n\\n“Here we are!” said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room.\\n“The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr.\\nRyder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers before we\\nsettle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what became of\\nthose geese?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\n\\n“Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in which\\nyou were interested—white, with a black bar across the tail.”\\n\\n\\nRyder quivered with emotion. “Oh, sir,” he cried, “can you\\ntell me where it went to?”\\n\\n\\n“It came here.”\\n\\n\\n“Here?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don’t wonder that you\\nshould take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead—the\\nbonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here in my\\nmuseum.”\\n\\n\\nOur visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right\\nhand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle, which\\nshone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder\\nstood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.\\n\\n\\n“The game’s up, Ryder,” said Holmes quietly. “Hold up,\\nman, or you’ll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair,\\nWatson. He’s not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give\\nhim a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it\\nis, to be sure!”\\n\\n\\nFor a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge\\nof colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his\\naccuser.\\n\\n\\n“I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could\\npossibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that little\\nmay as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had heard, Ryder, of\\nthis blue stone of the Countess of Morcar’s?”\\n\\n\\n“It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,” said he in a crackling\\nvoice.\\n\\n\\n“I see—her ladyship’s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of\\nsudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for\\nbetter men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used.\\nIt seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very pretty villain in\\nyou. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some\\nsuch matter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him.\\nWhat did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady’s\\nroom—you and your confederate Cusack—and you managed that he should\\nbe the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised\\nthe alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested. You then—”\\n\\n\\nRyder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my\\ncompanion’s knees. “For God’s sake, have mercy!” he\\nshrieked. “Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts.\\nI never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I’ll swear it\\non a Bible. Oh, don’t bring it into court! For Christ’s sake,\\ndon’t!”\\n\\n\\n“Get back into your chair!” said Holmes sternly. “It is very\\nwell to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner\\nin the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.”\\n\\n\\n“I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge\\nagainst him will break down.”\\n\\n\\n“Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of the\\nnext act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the\\nopen market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety.”\\n\\n\\nRyder passed his tongue over his parched lips. “I will tell you it just\\nas it happened, sir,” said he. “When Horner had been arrested, it\\nseemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once,\\nfor I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads\\nto search me and my room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be\\nsafe. I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister’s\\nhouse. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road, where\\nshe fattened fowls for the market. All the way there every man I met seemed to\\nme to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the\\nsweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister\\nasked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had\\nbeen upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard\\nand smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.\\n\\n\\n“I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just\\nbeen serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell into talk\\nabout the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what they stole. I\\nknew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I\\nmade up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my\\nconfidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money. But how to get\\nto him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from\\nthe hotel. I might at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the\\nstone in my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and\\nlooking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an\\nidea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that\\never lived.\\n\\n\\n“My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of\\nher geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as\\nher word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to\\nKilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of\\nthe birds—a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and\\nprying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger\\ncould reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet\\nand down into its crop. But the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my\\nsister to know what was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke\\nloose and fluttered off among the others.\\n\\n\\n“‘Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?’ says\\nshe.\\n\\n\\n“‘Well,’ said I, ‘you said you’d give me\\none for Christmas, and I was feeling which was the fattest.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Oh,’ says she, ‘we’ve set yours aside for\\nyou—Jem’s bird, we call it. It’s the big white one over\\nyonder. There’s twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for\\nus, and two dozen for the market.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Thank you, Maggie,’ says I; ‘but if it is all\\nthe same to you, I’d rather have that one I was handling just now.’\\n\\n\\n“‘The other is a good three pound heavier,’ said she,\\n‘and we fattened it expressly for you.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Never mind. I’ll have the other, and I’ll take\\nit now,’ said I.\\n\\n\\n“‘Oh, just as you like,’ said she, a little huffed.\\n‘Which is it you want, then?’\\n\\n\\n“‘That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of\\nthe flock.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.’\\n\\n\\n“Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the\\nway to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it was\\neasy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, and we got a\\nknife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of\\nthe stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird,\\nrushed back to my sister’s, and hurried into the back yard. There was not\\na bird to be seen there.\\n\\n\\n“‘Where are they all, Maggie?’ I cried.\\n\\n\\n“‘Gone to the dealer’s, Jem.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Which dealer’s?’\\n\\n\\n“‘Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.’\\n\\n\\n“‘But was there another with a barred tail?’ I asked,\\n‘the same as the one I chose?’\\n\\n\\n“‘Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could\\nnever tell them apart.’\\n\\n\\n“Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet\\nwould carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and\\nnot one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You heard him\\nyourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like that. My sister\\nthinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am myself. And\\nnow—and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the\\nwealth for which I sold my character. God help me! God help me!” He burst\\ninto convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.\\n\\n\\nThere was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the\\nmeasured tapping of Sherlock Holmes’ finger-tips upon the edge of the\\ntable. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.\\n\\n\\n“Get out!” said he.\\n\\n\\n“What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!”\\n\\n\\n“No more words. Get out!”\\n\\n\\nAnd no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the stairs, the\\nbang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street.\\n\\n\\n“After all, Watson,” said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay\\npipe, “I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If\\nHorner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will not\\nappear against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a\\nfelony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not\\ngo wrong again; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and you\\nmake him a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of forgiveness. Chance\\nhas put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is\\nits own reward. If you will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we\\nwill begin another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief\\nfeature.”\\n',\n",

       "  'body': '\\n“To the man who\\nloves art for its own sake,” remarked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside the\\nadvertisement sheet of The Daily Telegraph, “it is frequently in\\nits least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to\\nbe derived. It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far\\ngrasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have\\nbeen good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish,\\nyou have given prominence not so much to the many causes cÃ©lÃ¨bres and\\nsensational trials in which I have figured but rather to those incidents which\\nmay have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those\\nfaculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special\\nprovince.”\\n\\n\\n“And yet,” said I, smiling, “I cannot quite hold myself\\nabsolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my\\nrecords.”\\n\\n\\n“You have erred, perhaps,” he observed, taking up a glowing cinder\\nwith the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to\\nreplace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative\\nmood—“you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life\\ninto each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of\\nplacing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really\\nthe only notable feature about the thing.”\\n\\n\\n“It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,” I\\nremarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more\\nthan once observed to be a strong factor in my friend’s singular\\ncharacter.\\n\\n\\n“No, it is not selfishness or conceit,” said he, answering, as was\\nhis wont, my thoughts rather than my words. “If I claim full justice for\\nmy art, it is because it is an impersonal thing—a thing beyond myself.\\nCrime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon\\nthe crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a\\ncourse of lectures into a series of tales.”\\n\\n\\nIt was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either\\nside of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down\\nbetween the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like\\ndark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and\\nshone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not\\nbeen cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping\\ncontinuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at\\nlast, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet\\ntemper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.\\n\\n\\n“At the same time,” he remarked after a pause, during which he had\\nsat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, “you can\\nhardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you\\nhave been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of\\ncrime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to\\nhelp the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the\\nproblem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the incident of the\\nnoble bachelor, were all matters which are outside the pale of the law. But in\\navoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have bordered on the\\ntrivial.”\\n\\n\\n“The end may have been so,” I answered, “but the methods I\\nhold to have been novel and of interest.”\\n\\n\\n“Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public,\\nwho could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb,\\ncare about the finer shades of analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are\\ntrivial, I cannot blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or\\nat least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As to my own\\nlittle practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost\\nlead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think\\nthat I have touched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks\\nmy zero-point, I fancy. Read it!” He tossed a crumpled letter across to\\nme.\\n\\n\\nIt was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran thus:\\n\\n\\n“DEAR MR. HOLMES,—I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I\\nshould or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as\\ngoverness. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do not inconvenience\\nyou. Yours faithfully,\\n\\n\\n“VIOLET HUNTER.”\\n\\n\\n“Do you know the young lady?” I asked.\\n\\n\\n“Not I.”\\n\\n\\n“It is half-past ten now.”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.”\\n\\n\\n“It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember that\\nthe affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first,\\ndeveloped into a serious investigation. It may be so in this case, also.”\\n\\n\\n“Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for here,\\nunless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.”\\n\\n\\nAs he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was plainly\\nbut neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover’s\\negg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in\\nthe world.\\n\\n\\n“You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,” said she, as my\\ncompanion rose to greet her, “but I have had a very strange experience,\\nand as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice,\\nI thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should\\ndo.”\\n\\n\\n“Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I\\ncan to serve you.”\\n\\n\\nI could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of\\nhis new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion, and then composed\\nhimself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together, to listen to her\\nstory.\\n\\n\\n“I have been a governess for five years,” said she, “in the\\nfamily of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an\\nappointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to America\\nwith him, so that I found myself without a situation. I advertised, and I\\nanswered advertisements, but without success. At last the little money which I\\nhad saved began to run short, and I was at my wit’s end as to what I\\nshould do.\\n\\n\\n“There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called\\nWestaway’s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see\\nwhether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the name of\\nthe founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits\\nin her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an\\nanteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers and\\nsees whether she has anything which would suit them.\\n\\n\\n“Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as\\nusual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout man\\nwith a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon\\nfold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose,\\nlooking very earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a\\njump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.\\n\\n\\n“‘That will do,’ said he; ‘I could not ask for\\nanything better. Capital! capital!’ He seemed quite enthusiastic and\\nrubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a\\ncomfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.\\n\\n\\n“‘You are looking for a situation, miss?’ he asked.\\n\\n\\n“‘Yes, sir.’\\n\\n\\n“‘As governess?’\\n\\n\\n“‘Yes, sir.’\\n\\n\\n“‘And what salary do you ask?’\\n\\n\\n“‘I had Â£ 4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence\\nMunro.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Oh, tut, tut! sweating—rank sweating!’ he\\ncried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling\\npassion. ‘How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such\\nattractions and accomplishments?’\\n\\n\\n“‘My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you\\nimagine,’ said I. ‘A little French, a little German, music, and\\ndrawing—’\\n\\n\\n“‘Tut, tut!’ he cried. ‘This is all quite beside\\nthe question. The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment\\nof a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted for\\nthe rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history\\nof the country. But if you have, why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to\\ncondescend to accept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me,\\nmadam, would commence at Â£ 100 a year.’\\n\\n\\n“You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an\\noffer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps\\nthe look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a note.\\n\\n\\n“‘It is also my custom,’ said he, smiling in the most\\npleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the\\nwhite creases of his face, ‘to advance to my young ladies half their\\nsalary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey\\nand their wardrobe.’\\n\\n\\n“It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a\\nman. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great\\nconvenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction\\nwhich made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself.\\n\\n\\n“‘May I ask where you live, sir?’ said I.\\n\\n\\n“‘Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five\\nmiles on the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear\\nyoung lady, and the dearest old country-house.’\\n\\n\\n“‘And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they\\nwould be.’\\n\\n\\n“‘One child—one dear little romper just six years old.\\nOh, if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack!\\nsmack! Three gone before you could wink!’ He leaned back in his chair and\\nlaughed his eyes into his head again.\\n\\n\\n“I was a little startled at the nature of the child’s amusement,\\nbut the father’s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.\\n\\n\\n“‘My sole duties, then,’ I asked, ‘are to take\\ncharge of a single child?’\\n\\n\\n“‘No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young\\nlady,’ he cried. ‘Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense\\nwould suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always\\nthat they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no\\ndifficulty, heh?’\\n\\n\\n“‘I should be happy to make myself useful.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people,\\nyou know—faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress\\nwhich we might give you, you would not object to our little whim. Heh?’\\n\\n\\n“‘No,’ said I, considerably astonished at his words.\\n\\n\\n“‘Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive\\nto you?’\\n\\n\\n“‘Oh, no.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to\\nus?’\\n\\n\\n“I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my hair\\nis somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut. It has been\\nconsidered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand\\nfashion.\\n\\n\\n“‘I am afraid that that is quite impossible,’ said I.\\nHe had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow\\npass over his face as I spoke.\\n\\n\\n“‘I am afraid that it is quite essential,’ said he.\\n‘It is a little fancy of my wife’s, and ladies’ fancies, you\\nknow, madam, ladies’ fancies must be consulted. And so you won’t\\ncut your hair?’\\n\\n\\n“‘No, sir, I really could not,’ I answered firmly.\\n\\n\\n“‘Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a\\npity, because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In that\\ncase, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies.’\\n\\n\\n“The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a\\nword to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her\\nface that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission\\nthrough my refusal.\\n\\n\\n“‘Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?’\\nshe asked.\\n\\n\\n“‘If you please, Miss Stoper.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the\\nmost excellent offers in this fashion,’ said she sharply. ‘You can\\nhardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you.\\nGood-day to you, Miss Hunter.’ She struck a gong upon the table, and I\\nwas shown out by the page.\\n\\n\\n“Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough\\nin the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table, I began to ask myself\\nwhether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all, if these people had\\nstrange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they\\nwere at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few governesses in\\nEngland are getting Â£ 100 a year. Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many\\npeople are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be among the\\nnumber. Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the\\nday after I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back\\nto the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received this\\nletter from the gentleman himself. I have it here and I will read it to you:\\n\\n\\n“‘The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.\\n“‘DEAR MISS HUNTER,—Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your\\naddress, and I write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your\\ndecision. My wife is very anxious that you should come, for she has been much\\nattracted by my description of you. We are willing to give Â£ 30 a quarter, or Â£\\n120 a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads\\nmay cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife is fond of a\\nparticular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress\\nindoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing\\none, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia),\\nwhich would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or\\nthere, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no\\ninconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as I\\ncould not help remarking its beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid\\nthat I must remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased\\nsalary may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child is\\nconcerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the\\ndog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train. Yours faithfully,\\n\\n\\n“‘JEPHRO RUCASTLE.’\\n\\n\\n“That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind\\nis made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before taking the\\nfinal step I should like to submit the whole matter to your\\nconsideration.”\\n\\n\\n“Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the\\nquestion,” said Holmes, smiling.\\n\\n\\n“But you would not advise me to refuse?”\\n\\n\\n“I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a\\nsister of mine apply for.”\\n\\n\\n“What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?”\\n\\n\\n“Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed some\\nopinion?”\\n\\n\\n“Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle\\nseemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his wife is\\na lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be\\ntaken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to\\nprevent an outbreak?”\\n\\n\\n“That is a possible solution—in fact, as matters stand, it is the\\nmost probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for\\na young lady.”\\n\\n\\n“But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!”\\n\\n\\n“Well, yes, of course the pay is good—too good. That is what makes\\nme uneasy. Why should they give you Â£ 120 a year, when they could have their\\npick for Â£ 40? There must be some strong reason behind.”\\n\\n\\n“I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand\\nafterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I felt that\\nyou were at the back of me.”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your\\nlittle problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for\\nsome months. There is something distinctly novel about some of the features. If\\nyou should find yourself in doubt or in danger—”\\n\\n\\n“Danger! What danger do you foresee?”\\n\\n\\nHolmes shook his head gravely. “It would cease to be a danger if we could\\ndefine it,” said he. “But at any time, day or night, a telegram\\nwould bring me down to your help.”\\n\\n\\n“That is enough.” She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety\\nall swept from her face. “I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my\\nmind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair\\nto-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow.” With a few grateful words\\nto Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way.\\n\\n\\n“At least,” said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the\\nstairs, “she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care\\nof herself.”\\n\\n\\n“And she would need to be,” said Holmes gravely. “I am much\\nmistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past.”\\n\\n\\nIt was not very long before my friend’s prediction was fulfilled. A\\nfortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her\\ndirection and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely\\nwoman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light\\nduties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or\\nwhether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my\\npowers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half\\nan hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the\\nmatter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. “Data! data!\\ndata!” he cried impatiently. “I can’t make bricks without\\nclay.” And yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his\\nshould ever have accepted such a situation.\\n\\n\\nThe telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I was\\nthinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night\\nchemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I would leave him\\nstooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him in the same\\nposition when I came down to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow\\nenvelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.\\n\\n\\n“Just look up the trains in Bradshaw,” said he, and turned back to\\nhis chemical studies.\\n\\n\\nThe summons was a brief and urgent one.\\n\\n\\n“Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday\\nto-morrow,” it said. “Do come! I am at my wit’s end.\\n\\n\\n“HUNTER.”\\n\\n\\n“Will you come with me?” asked Holmes, glancing up.\\n\\n\\n“I should wish to.”\\n\\n\\n“Just look it up, then.”\\n\\n\\n“There is a train at half-past nine,” said I, glancing over my\\nBradshaw. “It is due at Winchester at 11:30.”\\n\\n\\n“That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis\\nof the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the morning.”\\n\\n\\nBy eleven o’clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old\\nEnglish capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down,\\nbut after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them down and began to\\nadmire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with\\nlittle fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was\\nshining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which\\nset an edge to a man’s energy. All over the countryside, away to the\\nrolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and grey roofs of the\\nfarm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage.\\n\\n\\n“Are they not fresh and beautiful?” I cried with all the enthusiasm\\nof a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.\\n\\n\\nBut Holmes shook his head gravely.\\n\\n\\n“Do you know, Watson,” said he, “that it is one of the curses\\nof a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference\\nto my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are\\nimpressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which comes to\\nme is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be\\ncommitted there.”\\n\\n\\n“Good heavens!” I cried. “Who would associate crime with\\nthese dear old homesteads?”\\n\\n\\n“They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson,\\nfounded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not\\npresent a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful\\ncountryside.”\\n\\n\\n“You horrify me!”\\n\\n\\n“But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do in\\nthe town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile that the\\nscream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard’s blow, does not\\nbeget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then the whole\\nmachinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it\\ngoing, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at\\nthese lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor\\nignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish\\ncruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such\\nplaces, and none the wiser. Had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to\\nlive in Winchester, I should never have had a fear for her. It is the five\\nmiles of country which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not\\npersonally threatened.”\\n\\n\\n“No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.”\\n\\n\\n“Quite so. She has her freedom.”\\n\\n\\n“What can be the matter, then? Can you suggest no\\nexplanation?”\\n\\n\\n“I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover\\nthe facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can only be\\ndetermined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for\\nus. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that\\nMiss Hunter has to tell.”\\n\\n\\nThe Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance from the\\nstation, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. She had engaged a\\nsitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.\\n\\n\\n“I am so delighted that you have come,” she said earnestly.\\n“It is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should\\ndo. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me.”\\n\\n\\n“Pray tell us what has happened to you.”\\n\\n\\n“I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to\\nbe back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning, though he\\nlittle knew for what purpose.”\\n\\n\\n“Let us have everything in its due order.” Holmes thrust his long\\nthin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.\\n\\n\\n“In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no\\nactual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to them to say\\nthat. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my mind about\\nthem.”\\n\\n\\n“What can you not understand?”\\n\\n\\n“Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it\\noccurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in his\\ndog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it\\nis not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house,\\nwhitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are\\ngrounds round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes\\ndown to the Southampton high road, which curves past about a hundred yards from\\nthe front door. This ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all\\nround are part of Lord Southerton’s preserves. A clump of copper beeches\\nimmediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.\\n\\n\\n“I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was\\nintroduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no truth,\\nMr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms\\nat Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to be a silent,\\npale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should\\nthink, while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their conversation I\\nhave gathered that they have been married about seven years, that he was a\\nwidower, and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has\\ngone to Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she\\nhad left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As\\nthe daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that her\\nposition must have been uncomfortable with her father’s young wife.\\n\\n\\n“Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in\\nfeature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a\\nnonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her\\nhusband and to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered continually from\\none to the other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible. He\\nwas kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they\\nseemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman.\\nShe would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face.\\nMore than once I have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it\\nwas the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never\\nmet so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small for\\nhis age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His whole life\\nappears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy\\nintervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to\\nbe his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning\\nthe capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would rather not talk\\nabout the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my\\nstory.”\\n\\n\\n“I am glad of all details,” remarked my friend, “whether they\\nseem to you to be relevant or not.”\\n\\n\\n“I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant thing\\nabout the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and conduct of the\\nservants. There are only two, a man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name,\\nis a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell\\nof drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet\\nMr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong\\nwoman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They\\nare a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the\\nnursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of the\\nbuilding.\\n\\n\\n“For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very\\nquiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered\\nsomething to her husband.\\n\\n\\n“‘Oh, yes,’ said he, turning to me, ‘we are very\\nmuch obliged to you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to\\ncut your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from\\nyour appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you.\\nYou will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so\\ngood as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.’\\n\\n\\n“The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue.\\nIt was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs\\nof having been worn before. It could not have been a better fit if I had been\\nmeasured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of\\nit, which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for me\\nin the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire\\nfront of the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair\\nhad been placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it.\\nIn this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the\\nother side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that\\nI have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I laughed\\nuntil I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of\\nhumour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad,\\nanxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked\\nthat it was time to commence the duties of the day, and that I might change my\\ndress and go to little Edward in the nursery.\\n\\n\\n“Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly\\nsimilar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and\\nagain I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an\\nimmense rÃ©pertoire, and which he told inimitably. Then he handed me a\\nyellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow\\nmight not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for\\nabout ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in\\nthe middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.\\n\\n\\n“You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what the\\nmeaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They were always\\nvery careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the window, so that I\\nbecame consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back. At\\nfirst it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror\\nhad been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the\\nglass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I\\nput my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see\\nall that there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was\\nnothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance, however,\\nI perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small\\nbearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The road\\nis an important highway, and there are usually people there. This man, however,\\nwas leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking\\nearnestly up. I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find\\nher eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am\\nconvinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what\\nwas behind me. She rose at once.\\n\\n\\n“‘Jephro,’ said she, ‘there is an impertinent\\nfellow upon the road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.’\\n\\n\\n“‘No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?’ he asked.\\n\\n\\n“‘No, I know no one in these parts.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion\\nto him to go away.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Surely it would be better to take no notice.’\\n\\n\\n“‘No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly\\nturn round and wave him away like that.’\\n\\n\\n“I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down the\\nblind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in the\\nwindow, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road.”\\n\\n\\n“Pray continue,” said Holmes. “Your narrative promises to be\\na most interesting one.”\\n\\n\\n“You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be\\nlittle relation between the different incidents of which I speak. On the very\\nfirst day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small\\nouthouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the\\nsharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about.\\n\\n\\n“‘Look in here!’ said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit\\nbetween two planks. ‘Is he not a beauty?’\\n\\n\\n“I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague\\nfigure huddled up in the darkness.\\n\\n\\n“‘Don’t be frightened,’ said my employer,\\nlaughing at the start which I had given. ‘It’s only Carlo, my\\nmastiff. I call him mine, but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who\\ncan do anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so\\nthat he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and\\nGod help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness’ sake\\ndon’t you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night,\\nfor it’s as much as your life is worth.’\\n\\n\\n“The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out\\nof my bedroom window about two o’clock in the morning. It was a beautiful\\nmoonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and\\nalmost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the\\nscene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the\\ncopper beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It was a\\ngiant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle,\\nand huge projecting bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into\\nthe shadow upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart\\nwhich I do not think that any burglar could have done.\\n\\n\\n“And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you\\nknow, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the\\nbottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse\\nmyself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little\\nthings. There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty\\nand open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two with my linen, and\\nas I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use\\nof the third drawer. It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere\\noversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first\\nkey fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one thing\\nin it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It was my coil of\\nhair.\\n\\n\\n“I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and the\\nsame thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon\\nme. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With trembling hands I\\nundid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair.\\nI laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was\\nit not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it\\nmeant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the\\nmatter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening\\na drawer which they had locked.\\n\\n\\n“I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I\\nsoon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was one wing,\\nhowever, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door which faced that\\nwhich led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was\\ninvariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr.\\nRucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his\\nface which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I\\nwas accustomed. His cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and\\nthe veins stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried\\npast me without a word or a look.\\n\\n\\n“This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds\\nwith my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows\\nof this part of the house. There were four of them in a row, three of which\\nwere simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all\\ndeserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr.\\nRucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.\\n\\n\\n“‘Ah!’ said he, ‘you must not think me rude if I\\npassed you without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business\\nmatters.’\\n\\n\\n“I assured him that I was not offended. ‘By the way,’ said I,\\n‘you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them\\nhas the shutters up.’\\n\\n\\n“He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my\\nremark.\\n\\n\\n“‘Photography is one of my hobbies,’ said he. ‘I\\nhave made my dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we\\nhave come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed\\nit?’ He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he\\nlooked at me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.\\n\\n\\n“Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was\\nsomething about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on fire\\nto go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of that. It\\nwas more a feeling of duty—a feeling that some good might come from my\\npenetrating to this place. They talk of woman’s instinct; perhaps it was\\nwoman’s instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there,\\nand I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.\\n\\n\\n“It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that, besides\\nMr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted\\nrooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the\\ndoor. Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very\\ndrunk; and when I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt\\nat all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs,\\nand the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned\\nthe key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.\\n\\n\\n“There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted,\\nwhich turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner were three\\ndoors in a line, the first and third of which were open. They each led into an\\nempty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the\\nother, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them.\\nThe centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been fastened one\\nof the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall,\\nand fastened at the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well,\\nand the key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the\\nshuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it\\nthat the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a skylight which let in\\nlight from above. As I stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and\\nwondering what secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within\\nthe room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of\\ndim light which shone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose\\nup in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and\\nI turned and ran—ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me\\nclutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the\\ndoor, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside.\\n\\n\\n“‘So,’ said he, smiling, ‘it was you, then. I\\nthought that it must be when I saw the door open.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Oh, I am so frightened!’ I panted.\\n\\n\\n“‘My dear young lady! my dear young lady!’—you\\ncannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was—‘and what\\nhas frightened you, my dear young lady?’\\n\\n\\n“But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was keenly\\non my guard against him.\\n\\n\\n“‘I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,’ I\\nanswered. ‘But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was\\nfrightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!’\\n\\n\\n“‘Only that?’ said he, looking at me keenly.\\n\\n\\n“‘Why, what did you think?’ I asked.\\n\\n\\n“‘Why do you think that I lock this door?’\\n\\n\\n“‘I am sure that I do not know.’\\n\\n\\n“‘It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you\\nsee?’ He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.\\n\\n\\n“‘I am sure if I had known—’\\n\\n\\n“‘Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot\\nover that threshold again’—here in an instant the smile hardened\\ninto a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a\\ndemon—‘I’ll throw you to the mastiff.’\\n\\n\\n“I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I must\\nhave rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I found myself\\nlying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could\\nnot live there longer without some advice. I was frightened of the house, of\\nthe man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all\\nhorrible to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of course I\\nmight have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as my\\nfears. My mind was soon made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and\\ncloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and\\nthen returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind as\\nI approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered that Toller\\nhad drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening, and I knew that\\nhe was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage\\ncreature, or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and lay\\nawake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you. I had no\\ndifficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning, but I must be\\nback before three o’clock, for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a\\nvisit, and will be away all the evening, so that I must look after the child.\\nNow I have told you all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if\\nyou could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.”\\n\\n\\nHolmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My friend\\nrose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an\\nexpression of the most profound gravity upon his face.\\n\\n\\n“Is Toller still drunk?” he asked.\\n\\n\\n“Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing with\\nhim.”\\n\\n\\n“That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n\\n“Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, the wine-cellar.”\\n\\n\\n“You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave\\nand sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one more\\nfeat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite exceptional\\nwoman.”\\n\\n\\n“I will try. What is it?”\\n\\n\\n“We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o’clock, my friend and\\nI. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be\\nincapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If you\\ncould send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon her,\\nyou would facilitate matters immensely.”\\n\\n\\n“I will do it.”\\n\\n\\n“Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course\\nthere is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to\\npersonate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber. That is\\nobvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter,\\nMiss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to America.\\nYou were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the colour\\nof your hair. Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some illness through\\nwhich she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a\\ncurious chance you came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly\\nsome friend of hers—possibly her fiancÃ©—and no doubt, as you\\nwore the girl’s dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your\\nlaughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss\\nRucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions.\\nThe dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate\\nwith her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case is the\\ndisposition of the child.”\\n\\n\\n“What on earth has that to do with it?” I ejaculated.\\n\\n\\n“My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to\\nthe tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don’t you see that\\nthe converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first real insight\\ninto the character of parents by studying their children. This child’s\\ndisposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty’s sake, and whether\\nhe derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his\\nmother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power.”\\n\\n\\n“I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,” cried our client.\\n“A thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have\\nhit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor\\ncreature.”\\n\\n\\n“We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We\\ncan do nothing until seven o’clock. At that hour we shall be with you,\\nand it will not be long before we solve the mystery.”\\n\\n\\nWe were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the Copper\\nBeeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The group of trees,\\nwith their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting\\nsun, were sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been standing\\nsmiling on the door-step.\\n\\n\\n“Have you managed it?” asked Holmes.\\n\\n\\nA loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. “That is Mrs.\\nToller in the cellar,” said she. “Her husband lies snoring on the\\nkitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr.\\nRucastle’s.”\\n\\n\\n“You have done well indeed!” cried Holmes with enthusiasm.\\n“Now lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black\\nbusiness.”\\n\\n\\nWe passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and\\nfound ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described.\\nHolmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he tried the various\\nkeys in the lock, but without success. No sound came from within, and at the\\nsilence Holmes’ face clouded over.\\n\\n\\n“I trust that we are not too late,” said he. “I think, Miss\\nHunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to\\nit, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.”\\n\\n\\nIt was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength.\\nTogether we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture save a\\nlittle pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The skylight above\\nwas open, and the prisoner gone.\\n\\n\\n“There has been some villainy here,” said Holmes; “this\\nbeauty has guessed Miss Hunter’s intentions and has carried his victim\\noff.”\\n\\n\\n“But how?”\\n\\n\\n“Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.” He\\nswung himself up onto the roof. “Ah, yes,” he cried,\\n“here’s the end of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is\\nhow he did it.”\\n\\n\\n“But it is impossible,” said Miss Hunter; “the ladder was not\\nthere when the Rucastles went away.”\\n\\n\\n“He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and\\ndangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I\\nhear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be as well for you to\\nhave your pistol ready.”\\n\\n\\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the\\nroom, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand. Miss Hunter\\nscreamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes\\nsprang forward and confronted him.\\n\\n\\n“You villain!” said he, “where’s your daughter?”\\n\\n\\nThe fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.\\n\\n\\n“It is for me to ask you that,” he shrieked, “you thieves!\\nSpies and thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I’ll\\nserve you!” He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could\\ngo.\\n\\n\\n“He’s gone for the dog!” cried Miss Hunter.\\n\\n\\n“I have my revolver,” said I.\\n\\n\\n“Better close the front door,” cried Holmes, and we all rushed down\\nthe stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of\\na hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying sound which it\\nwas dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs\\ncame staggering out at a side door.\\n\\n\\n“My God!” he cried. “Someone has loosed the dog. It’s\\nnot been fed for two days. Quick, quick, or it’ll be too late!”\\n\\n\\nHolmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller hurrying\\nbehind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle buried in\\nRucastle’s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the ground. Running\\nup, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth still\\nmeeting in the great creases of his neck. With much labour we separated them\\nand carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. We laid him upon\\nthe drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the\\nnews to his wife, I did what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled\\nround him when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.\\n\\n\\n“Mrs. Toller!” cried Miss Hunter.\\n\\n\\n“Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up\\nto you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn’t let me know what you were\\nplanning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.”\\n\\n\\n“Ha!” said Holmes, looking keenly at her. “It is clear that\\nMrs. Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else.”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.”\\n\\n\\n“Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points on\\nwhich I must confess that I am still in the dark.”\\n\\n\\n“I will soon make it clear to you,” said she; “and I’d\\nhave done so before now if I could ha’ got out from the cellar. If\\nthere’s police-court business over this, you’ll remember that I was\\nthe one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice’s friend too.\\n\\n\\n“She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn’t, from the time that\\nher father married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything, but\\nit never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler at a\\nfriend’s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her\\nown by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a\\nword about them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle’s hands. He knew\\nhe was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward,\\nwho would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought it\\ntime to put a stop on it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she\\nmarried or not, he could use her money. When she wouldn’t do it, he kept\\non worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at\\ndeath’s door. Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with\\nher beautiful hair cut off; but that didn’t make no change in her young\\nman, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.”\\n\\n\\n“Ah,” said Holmes, “I think that what you have been good\\nenough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that\\nremains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of\\nimprisonment?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\n\\n“And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the\\ndisagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.”\\n\\n\\n“That was it, sir.”\\n\\n\\n“But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be,\\nblockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments,\\nmetallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same as\\nhis.”\\n\\n\\n“Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,” said\\nMrs. Toller serenely.\\n\\n\\n“And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of\\ndrink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had\\ngone out.”\\n\\n\\n“You have it, sir, just as it happened.”\\n\\n\\n“I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,” said Holmes,\\n“for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here\\ncomes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had\\nbest escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our locus\\nstandi now is rather a questionable one.”\\n\\n\\nAnd thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches\\nin front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept\\nalive solely through the care of his devoted wife. They still live with their\\nold servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle’s past life that he\\nfinds it difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were\\nmarried, by special license, in Southampton the day after their flight, and he\\nis now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to\\nMiss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested\\nno further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of\\nhis problems, and she is now the head of a private school at Walsall, where I\\nbelieve that she has met with considerable success.\\n',\n",

       "  'body': '\\nThe Lord St. Simon\\nmarriage, and its curious termination, have long ceased to be a subject of\\ninterest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves.\\nFresh scandals have eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the\\ngossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe,\\nhowever, that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public,\\nand as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the\\nmatter up, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little\\nsketch of this remarkable episode.\\n\\n\\nIt was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was still\\nsharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from an afternoon\\nstroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. I had remained indoors\\nall day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal\\nwinds, and the jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a\\nrelic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in one\\neasy-chair and my legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of\\nnewspapers until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all\\naside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope\\nupon the table and wondering lazily who my friend’s noble correspondent\\ncould be.\\n\\n\\n“Here is a very fashionable epistle,” I remarked as he entered.\\n“Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a\\ntide-waiter.”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,” he\\nanswered, smiling, “and the humbler are usually the more interesting.\\nThis looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man\\neither to be bored or to lie.”\\n\\n\\nHe broke the seal and glanced over the contents.\\n\\n\\n“Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.”\\n\\n\\n“Not social, then?”\\n\\n\\n“No, distinctly professional.”\\n\\n\\n“And from a noble client?”\\n\\n\\n“One of the highest in England.”\\n\\n\\n“My dear fellow, I congratulate you.”\\n\\n\\n“I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my client\\nis a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case. It is just\\npossible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation.\\nYou have been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?”\\n\\n\\n“It looks like it,” said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in\\nthe corner. “I have had nothing else to do.”\\n\\n\\n“It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read\\nnothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is always\\ninstructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely you must have\\nread about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yes, with the deepest interest.”\\n\\n\\n“That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St. Simon.\\nI will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these papers and let me\\nhave whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he says:\\n\\n\\n“‘MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—Lord Backwater tells me\\nthat I may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I have\\ndetermined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the\\nvery painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding. Mr.\\nLestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting already in the matter, but he assures me\\nthat he sees no objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it\\nmight be of some assistance. I will call at four o’clock in the\\nafternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time, I hope that\\nyou will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount importance. Yours\\nfaithfully,\\n\\n\\n“‘ROBERT ST. SIMON.’\\n\\n\\n“It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the\\nnoble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of\\nhis right little finger,” remarked Holmes as he folded up the epistle.\\n\\n\\n“He says four o’clock. It is three now. He will be here in an\\nhour.”\\n\\n\\n“Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the\\nsubject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of\\ntime, while I take a glance as to who our client is.” He picked a\\nred-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece.\\n“Here he is,” said he, sitting down and flattening it out upon his\\nknee. “‘Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son\\nof the Duke of Balmoral.’ Hum! ‘Arms: Azure, three caltrops in\\nchief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.’ He’s forty-one years of\\nage, which is mature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the colonies in a\\nlate administration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for\\nForeign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on\\nthe distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in all this. I\\nthink that I must turn to you Watson, for something more solid.”\\n\\n\\n“I have very little difficulty in finding what I want,” said I,\\n“for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable.\\nI feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry on\\nhand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van.\\nThat is quite cleared up now—though, indeed, it was obvious from the\\nfirst. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.”\\n\\n\\n“Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal column\\nof the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks back: ‘A\\nmarriage has been arranged,’ it says, ‘and will, if rumour is\\ncorrect, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of\\nthe Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius\\nDoran. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.’ That is all.”\\n\\n\\n“Terse and to the point,” remarked Holmes, stretching his long,\\nthin legs towards the fire.\\n\\n\\n“There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of\\nthe same week. Ah, here it is: ‘There will soon be a call for protection\\nin the marriage  market, for the present free-trade principle appears to tell\\nheavily against our home product. One by one the management of the noble houses\\nof Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the\\nAtlantic. An important addition has been made during the last week to the list\\nof the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St.\\nSimon, who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little\\ngod’s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with\\nMiss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss\\nDoran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the\\nWestbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is currently reported that\\nher dowry will run to considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for\\nthe future. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been\\ncompelled to sell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon\\nhas no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious\\nthat the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will\\nenable her to make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a\\nBritish peeress.’”\\n\\n\\n“Anything else?” asked Holmes, yawning.\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the Morning Post\\nto say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at\\nSt. George’s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate friends\\nwould be invited, and that the party would return to the furnished house at\\nLancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days\\nlater—that is, on Wednesday last—there is a curt announcement that\\nthe wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord\\nBackwater’s place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices which\\nappeared before the disappearance of the bride.”\\n\\n\\n“Before the what?” asked Holmes with a start.\\n\\n\\n“The vanishing of the lady.”\\n\\n\\n“When did she vanish, then?”\\n\\n\\n“At the wedding breakfast.”\\n\\n\\n“Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic,\\nin fact.”\\n\\n\\n“Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.”\\n\\n\\n“They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the\\nhoneymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this. Pray let\\nme have the details.”\\n\\n\\n“I warn you that they are very incomplete.”\\n\\n\\n“Perhaps we may make them less so.”\\n\\n\\n“Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning\\npaper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, ‘Singular\\nOccurrence at a Fashionable Wedding’:\\n\\n\\n“‘The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into\\nthe greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken\\nplace in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly announced in the\\npapers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning; but it is only now that\\nit has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so\\npersistently floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush\\nthe matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good\\npurpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for\\nconversation.\\n\\n\\n“‘The ceremony, which was performed at St. George’s,\\nHanover Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of\\nthe bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord\\nEustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister of the\\nbridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards\\nto the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been\\nprepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman, whose name\\nhas not been ascertained, who endeavoured to force her way into the house after\\nthe bridal party, alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was\\nonly after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and\\nthe footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before this\\nunpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she\\ncomplained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room. Her prolonged\\nabsence having caused some comment, her father followed her, but learned from\\nher maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an\\nulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the footmen declared\\nthat he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused to\\ncredit that it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company. On\\nascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in\\nconjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with\\nthe police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will probably\\nresult in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business. Up to a late\\nhour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the\\nmissing lady. There are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that\\nthe police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original\\ndisturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some other motive, she may\\nhave been concerned in the strange disappearance of the\\nbride.’”\\n\\n\\n“And is that all?”\\n\\n\\n“Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a\\nsuggestive one.”\\n\\n\\n“And it is—”\\n\\n\\n“That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has\\nactually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a danseuse at\\nthe Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years. There are no\\nfurther particulars, and the whole case is in your hands now—so far as it\\nhas been set forth in the public press.”\\n\\n\\n“And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have\\nmissed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as the clock\\nmakes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this will prove to be\\nour noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having\\na witness, if only as a check to my own memory.”\\n\\n\\n“Lord Robert St. Simon,” announced our page-boy, throwing open the\\ndoor. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale,\\nwith something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady,\\nwell-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to\\nbe obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue\\nimpression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the\\nknees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat,\\nwas grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was\\ncareful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white\\nwaistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters. He\\nadvanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to right, and\\nswinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses.\\n\\n\\n“Good-day, Lord St. Simon,” said Holmes, rising and bowing.\\n“Pray take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson.\\nDraw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.”\\n\\n\\n“A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr.\\nHolmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have already\\nmanaged several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that they\\nwere hardly from the same class of society.”\\n\\n\\n“No, I am descending.”\\n\\n\\n“I beg pardon.”\\n\\n\\n“My last client of the sort was a king.”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?”\\n\\n\\n“The King of Scandinavia.”\\n\\n\\n“What! Had he lost his wife?”\\n\\n\\n“You can understand,” said Holmes suavely, “that I extend to\\nthe affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in\\nyours.”\\n\\n\\n“Of course! Very right! very right! I’m sure I beg pardon. As to my\\nown case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in\\nforming an opinion.”\\n\\n\\n“Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints,\\nnothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct—this article, for\\nexample, as to the disappearance of the bride.”\\n\\n\\nLord St. Simon glanced over it. “Yes, it is correct, as far as it\\ngoes.”\\n\\n\\n“But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an\\nopinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning\\nyou.”\\n\\n\\n“Pray do so.”\\n\\n\\n“When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?”\\n\\n\\n“In San Francisco, a year ago.”\\n\\n\\n“You were travelling in the States?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n\\n“Did you become engaged then?”\\n\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n\\n“But you were on a friendly footing?”\\n\\n\\n“I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.”\\n\\n\\n“Her father is very rich?”\\n\\n\\n“He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.”\\n\\n\\n“And how did he make his money?”\\n\\n\\n“In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold, invested\\nit, and came up by leaps and bounds.”\\n\\n\\n“Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady’s—your\\nwife’s character?”\\n\\n\\nThe nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire.\\n“You see, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “my wife was twenty before\\nher father became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining camp\\nand wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from\\nNature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a\\ntomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of\\ntraditions. She is impetuous—volcanic, I was about to say. She is swift\\nin making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. On the\\nother hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to\\nbear”—he gave a little stately cough—“had I not thought\\nher to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is capable of heroic\\nself-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to\\nher.”\\n\\n\\n“Have you her photograph?”\\n\\n\\n“I brought this with me.” He opened a locket and showed us the full\\nface of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature,\\nand the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair, the\\nlarge dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at\\nit. Then he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.\\n\\n\\n“The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your\\nacquaintance?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met her\\nseveral times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.”\\n\\n\\n“She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?”\\n\\n\\n“A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.”\\n\\n\\n“And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait\\naccompli?”\\n\\n\\n“I really have made no inquiries on the subject.”\\n\\n\\n“Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the\\nwedding?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n\\n“Was she in good spirits?”\\n\\n\\n“Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future\\nlives.”\\n\\n\\n“Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the\\nwedding?”\\n\\n\\n“She was as bright as possible—at least until after the\\nceremony.”\\n\\n\\n“And did you observe any change in her then?”\\n\\n\\n“Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen\\nthat her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was too trivial\\nto relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case.”\\n\\n\\n“Pray let us have it, for all that.”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the\\nvestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over into the\\npew. There was a moment’s delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it\\nup to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I\\nspoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on\\nour way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause.”\\n\\n\\n“Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the\\ngeneral public were present, then?”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is\\nopen.”\\n\\n\\n“This gentleman was not one of your wife’s friends?”\\n\\n\\n“No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a\\ncommon-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I think that\\nwe are wandering rather far from the point.”\\n\\n\\n“Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame\\nof mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering her\\nfather’s house?”\\n\\n\\n“I saw her in conversation with her maid.”\\n\\n\\n“And who is her maid?”\\n\\n\\n“Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California with\\nher.”\\n\\n\\n“A confidential servant?”\\n\\n\\n“A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to\\ntake great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these things\\nin a different way.”\\n\\n\\n“How long did she speak to this Alice?”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.”\\n\\n\\n“You did not overhear what they said?”\\n\\n\\n“Lady St. Simon said something about ‘jumping a claim.’ She\\nwas accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant.”\\n\\n\\n“American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do\\nwhen she finished speaking to her maid?”\\n\\n\\n“She walked into the breakfast-room.”\\n\\n\\n“On your arm?”\\n\\n\\n“No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then,\\nafter we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some\\nwords of apology, and left the room. She never came back.”\\n\\n\\n“But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her\\nroom, covered her bride’s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and\\nwent out.”\\n\\n\\n“Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company\\nwith Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had already made a\\ndisturbance at Mr. Doran’s house that morning.”\\n\\n\\n“Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and your\\nrelations to her.”\\n\\n\\nLord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. “We have\\nbeen on a friendly footing for some years—I may say on a very\\nfriendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her\\nungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you know\\nwhat women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly\\nhot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she\\nheard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the reason why I\\nhad the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there might be a\\nscandal in the church. She came to Mr. Doran’s door just after we\\nreturned, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very abusive\\nexpressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the\\npossibility of something of the sort, and I had two police fellows there in\\nprivate clothes, who soon pushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that\\nthere was no good in making a row.”\\n\\n\\n“Did your wife hear all this?”\\n\\n\\n“No, thank goodness, she did not.”\\n\\n\\n“And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so\\nserious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible\\ntrap for her.”\\n\\n\\n“Well, it is a possible supposition.”\\n\\n\\n“You think so, too?”\\n\\n\\n“I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this as\\nlikely?”\\n\\n\\n“I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.”\\n\\n\\n“Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is\\nyour own theory as to what took place?”\\n\\n\\n“Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have given\\nyou all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to\\nme as possible that the excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she\\nhad made so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little\\nnervous disturbance in my wife.”\\n\\n\\n“In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?”\\n\\n\\n“Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back—I will\\nnot say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without\\nsuccess—I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.”\\n\\n\\n“Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,” said\\nHolmes, smiling. “And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all\\nmy data. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that you\\ncould see out of the window?”\\n\\n\\n“We could see the other side of the road and the Park.”\\n\\n\\n“Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I shall\\ncommunicate with you.”\\n\\n\\n“Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,” said our\\nclient, rising.\\n\\n\\n“I have solved it.”\\n\\n\\n“Eh? What was that?”\\n\\n\\n“I say that I have solved it.”\\n\\n\\n“Where, then, is my wife?”\\n\\n\\n“That is a detail which I shall speedily supply.”\\n\\n\\nLord St. Simon shook his head. “I am afraid that it will take wiser heads\\nthan yours or mine,” he remarked, and bowing in a stately, old-fashioned\\nmanner he departed.\\n\\n\\n“It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on a\\nlevel with his own,” said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. “I think that\\nI shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning. I\\nhad formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the\\nroom.”\\n\\n\\n“My dear Holmes!”\\n\\n\\n“I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked\\nbefore, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to turn my\\nconjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very\\nconvincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau’s\\nexample.”\\n\\n\\n“But I have heard all that you have heard.”\\n\\n\\n“Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me so\\nwell. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and something\\non very much the same lines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War.\\nIt is one of these cases—but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon,\\nLestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are\\ncigars in the box.”\\n\\n\\nThe official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a\\ndecidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand.\\nWith a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been\\noffered to him.\\n\\n\\n“What’s up, then?” asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye.\\n“You look dissatisfied.”\\n\\n\\n“And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case. I\\ncan make neither head nor tail of the business.”\\n\\n\\n“Really! You surprise me.”\\n\\n\\n“Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip through\\nmy fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.”\\n\\n\\n“And very wet it seems to have made you,” said Holmes laying his\\nhand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.\\n\\n\\n“Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.”\\n\\n\\n“In Heaven’s name, what for?”\\n\\n\\n“In search of the body of Lady St. Simon.”\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.\\n\\n\\n“Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?” he\\nasked.\\n\\n\\n“Why? What do you mean?”\\n\\n\\n“Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one\\nas in the other.”\\n\\n\\nLestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. “I suppose you know all\\nabout it,” he snarled.\\n\\n\\n“Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the\\nmatter?”\\n\\n\\n“I think it very unlikely.”\\n\\n\\n“Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in\\nit?” He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a\\nwedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a bride’s\\nwreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. “There,” said\\nhe, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. “There is a\\nlittle nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, indeed!” said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air.\\n“You dragged them from the Serpentine?”\\n\\n\\n“No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They have\\nbeen identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the clothes were\\nthere the body would not be far off.”\\n\\n\\n“By the same brilliant reasoning, every man’s body is to be found\\nin the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive at\\nthrough this?”\\n\\n\\n“At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.”\\n\\n\\n“I am afraid that you will find it difficult.”\\n\\n\\n“Are you, indeed, now?” cried Lestrade with some bitterness.\\n“I am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your\\ndeductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes.\\nThis dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.”\\n\\n\\n“And how?”\\n\\n\\n“In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the card-case\\nis a note. And here is the very note.” He slapped it down upon the table\\nin front of him. “Listen to this: ‘You will see me when all is\\nready. Come at once. F. H. M.’ Now my theory all along has been that Lady\\nSt. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she, with confederates, no\\ndoubt, was responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her initials,\\nis the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door\\nand which lured her within their reach.”\\n\\n\\n“Very good, Lestrade,” said Holmes, laughing. “You really are\\nvery fine indeed. Let me see it.” He took up the paper in a listless way,\\nbut his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of\\nsatisfaction. “This is indeed important,” said he.\\n\\n\\n“Ha! you find it so?”\\n\\n\\n“Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly.”\\n\\n\\nLestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. “Why,” he\\nshrieked, “you’re looking at the wrong side!”\\n\\n\\n“On the contrary, this is the right side.”\\n\\n\\n“The right side? You’re mad! Here is the note written in pencil\\nover here.”\\n\\n\\n“And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, which\\ninterests me deeply.”\\n\\n\\n“There’s nothing in it. I looked at it before,” said\\nLestrade. “‘Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s.\\n6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s. 6d., glass sherry,\\n8d.’ I see nothing in that.”\\n\\n\\n“Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note, it\\nis important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate you\\nagain.”\\n\\n\\n“I’ve wasted time enough,” said Lestrade, rising. “I\\nbelieve in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories.\\nGood-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter\\nfirst.” He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made\\nfor the door.\\n\\n\\n“Just one hint to you, Lestrade,” drawled Holmes before his rival\\nvanished; “I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St.\\nSimon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such\\nperson.”\\n\\n\\nLestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his\\nforehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.\\n\\n\\nHe had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat.\\n“There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work,” he\\nremarked, “so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your papers for a\\nlittle.”\\n\\n\\nIt was after five o’clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time\\nto be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner’s man with\\na very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had\\nbrought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite\\nepicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house\\nmahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a pÃ¢tÃ©\\nde foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid\\nout all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the\\nArabian Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and\\nwere ordered to this address.\\n\\n\\nJust before nine o’clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room.\\nHis features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made me\\nthink that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.\\n\\n\\n“They have laid the supper, then,” he said, rubbing his hands.\\n\\n\\n“You seem to expect company. They have laid for five.”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,” said he.\\n“I am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy\\nthat I hear his step now upon the stairs.”\\n\\n\\nIt was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in, dangling his\\nglasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon\\nhis aristocratic features.\\n\\n\\n“My messenger reached you, then?” asked Holmes.\\n\\n\\n“Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have\\nyou good authority for what you say?”\\n\\n\\n“The best possible.”\\n\\n\\nLord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.\\n\\n\\n“What will the Duke say,” he murmured, “when he hears that\\none of the family has been subjected to such humiliation?”\\n\\n\\n“It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any\\nhumiliation.”\\n\\n\\n“Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint.”\\n\\n\\n“I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady\\ncould have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was\\nundoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise her at\\nsuch a crisis.”\\n\\n\\n“It was a slight, sir, a public slight,” said Lord St. Simon,\\ntapping his fingers upon the table.\\n\\n\\n“You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a\\nposition.”\\n\\n\\n“I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been\\nshamefully used.”\\n\\n\\n“I think that I heard a ring,” said Holmes. “Yes, there are\\nsteps on the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the\\nmatter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more\\nsuccessful.” He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman.\\n“Lord St. Simon,” said he “allow me to introduce you to Mr.\\nand Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met.”\\n\\n\\nAt the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood\\nvery erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his\\nfrock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had taken a quick step\\nforward and had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his\\neyes. It was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was one\\nwhich it was hard to resist.\\n\\n\\n“You’re angry, Robert,” said she. “Well, I guess you\\nhave every cause to be.”\\n\\n\\n“Pray make no apology to me,” said Lord St. Simon bitterly.\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should have\\nspoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time when\\nI saw Frank here again I just didn’t know what I was doing or saying. I\\nonly wonder I didn’t fall down and do a faint right there before the\\naltar.”\\n\\n\\n“Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the room\\nwhile you explain this matter?”\\n\\n\\n“If I may give an opinion,” remarked the strange gentleman,\\n“we’ve had just a little too much secrecy over this business\\nalready. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights\\nof it.” He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp\\nface and alert manner.\\n\\n\\n“Then I’ll tell our story right away,” said the lady.\\n“Frank here and I met in ’84, in McQuire’s camp, near the\\nRockies, where Pa was working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and\\nI; but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor\\nFrank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer Pa grew\\nthe poorer was Frank; so at last Pa wouldn’t hear of our engagement\\nlasting any longer, and he took me away to ’Frisco. Frank wouldn’t\\nthrow up his hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without Pa\\nknowing anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just\\nfixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his pile,\\ntoo, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa. So then I\\npromised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry\\nanyone else while he lived. ‘Why shouldn’t we be married right\\naway, then,’ said he, ‘and then I will feel sure of you; and I\\nwon’t claim to be your husband until I come back?’ Well, we talked\\nit over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in\\nwaiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek his\\nfortune, and I went back to Pa.\\n\\n\\n“The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went\\nprospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After that\\ncame a long newspaper story about how a miners’ camp had been attacked by\\nApache Indians, and there was my Frank’s name among the killed. I fainted\\ndead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline and\\ntook me to half the doctors in ’Frisco. Not a word of news came for a\\nyear and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead. Then Lord\\nSt. Simon came to ’Frisco, and we came to London, and a marriage was\\narranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I felt all the time that no man on this\\nearth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor\\nFrank.\\n\\n\\n“Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I’d have done my\\nduty by him. We can’t command our love, but we can our actions. I went to\\nthe altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was\\nin me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar\\nrails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the first\\npew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked again there he was\\nstill, with a kind of question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad\\nor sorry to see him. I wonder I didn’t drop. I know that everything was\\nturning round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee\\nin my ear. I didn’t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make a\\nscene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what I was\\nthinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. Then I\\nsaw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that he was writing me a note.\\nAs I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he\\nslipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a\\nline asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so. Of course I\\nnever doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him, and I determined\\nto do just whatever he might direct.\\n\\n\\n“When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and had\\nalways been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few things\\npacked and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to Lord St. Simon,\\nbut it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people. I just\\nmade up my mind to run away and explain afterwards. I hadn’t been at the\\ntable ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of the\\nroad. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park. I slipped out,\\nput on my things, and followed him. Some woman came talking something or other\\nabout Lord St. Simon to me—seemed to me from the little I heard as if he\\nhad a little secret of his own before marriage also—but I managed to get\\naway from her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away we\\ndrove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my true\\nwedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a prisoner among the\\nApaches, had escaped, came on to ’Frisco, found that I had given him up\\nfor dead and had gone to England, followed me there, and had come upon me at\\nlast on the very morning of my second wedding.”\\n\\n\\n“I saw it in a paper,” explained the American. “It gave the\\nname and the church but not where the lady lived.”\\n\\n\\n“Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for\\nopenness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like to\\nvanish away and never see any of them again—just sending a line to Pa,\\nperhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to think of all those\\nlords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come\\nback. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so\\nthat I should not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could\\nfind them. It is likely that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only\\nthat this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how\\nhe found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly\\nthat I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be putting\\nourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to give us a\\nchance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to\\nhis rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if I\\nhave given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very meanly of me.”\\n\\n\\nLord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened\\nwith a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative.\\n\\n\\n“Excuse me,” he said, “but it is not my custom to discuss my\\nmost intimate personal affairs in this public manner.”\\n\\n\\n“Then you won’t forgive me? You won’t shake hands before I\\ngo?”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.” He put out his\\nhand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.\\n\\n\\n“I had hoped,” suggested Holmes, “that you would have joined\\nus in a friendly supper.”\\n\\n\\n“I think that there you ask a little too much,” responded his\\nLordship. “I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but\\nI can hardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that with your\\npermission I will now wish you all a very good-night.” He included us all\\nin a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.\\n\\n\\n“Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your company,”\\nsaid Sherlock Holmes. “It is always a joy to meet an American, Mr.\\nMoulton, for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the\\nblundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children from\\nbeing some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall\\nbe a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes.”\\n\\n\\n“The case has been an interesting one,” remarked Holmes when our\\nvisitors had left us, “because it serves to show very clearly how simple\\nthe explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost\\ninexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as\\nnarrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than the result when viewed, for\\ninstance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard.”\\n\\n\\n“You were not yourself at fault at all, then?”\\n\\n\\n“From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the lady\\nhad been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other that she had\\nrepented of it within a few minutes of returning home. Obviously something had\\noccurred during the morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could\\nthat something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was out, for\\nshe had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If\\nshe had, it must be someone from America because she had spent so short a time\\nin this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an\\ninfluence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her\\nplans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a process of\\nexclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American. Then who could\\nthis American be, and why should he possess so much influence over her? It\\nmight be a lover; it might be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been\\nspent in rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got before I\\never heard Lord St. Simon’s narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew,\\nof the change in the bride’s manner, of so transparent a device for\\nobtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her\\nconfidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to\\nclaim-jumping—which in miners’ parlance means taking possession of\\nthat which another person has a prior claim to—the whole situation became\\nabsolutely clear. She had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover\\nor was a previous husband—the chances being in favour of the\\nlatter.”\\n\\n\\n“And how in the world did you find them?”\\n\\n\\n“It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in\\nhis hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials were, of\\ncourse, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it to know that\\nwithin a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select London\\nhotels.”\\n\\n\\n“How did you deduce the select?”\\n\\n\\n“By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a\\nglass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are not many\\nin London which charge at that rate. In the second one which I visited in\\nNorthumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H.\\nMoulton, an American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking\\nover the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I had seen in\\nthe duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so\\nthither I travelled, and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at\\nhome, I ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them\\nthat it would be better in every way that they should make their position a\\nlittle clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular.\\nI invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the\\nappointment.”\\n\\n\\n“But with no very good result,” I remarked. “His conduct was\\ncertainly not very gracious.”\\n\\n\\n“Ah, Watson,” said Holmes, smiling, “perhaps you would not be\\nvery gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you\\nfound yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think that we\\nmay judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never\\nlikely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw your chair up and hand me\\nmy violin, for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away\\nthese bleak autumnal evenings.”\\n',\n",

       "  'body': '\\nTo Sherlock Holmes she\\nis always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other\\nname. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was\\nnot that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and\\nthat one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably\\nbalanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing\\nmachine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in\\na false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a\\nsneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for drawing\\nthe veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to\\nadmit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was\\nto introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental\\nresults. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own\\nhigh-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a\\nnature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was\\nthe late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.\\n\\n\\nI had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each\\nother. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up\\naround the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were\\nsufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of\\nsociety with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street,\\nburied among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine\\nand ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen\\nnature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and\\noccupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in\\nfollowing out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been\\nabandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some\\nvague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the\\nTrepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson\\nbrothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished\\nso delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these\\nsigns of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of\\nthe daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\\n\\n\\nOne night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning\\nfrom a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my\\nway led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which\\nmust always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark\\nincidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see\\nHolmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His\\nrooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare\\nfigure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the\\nroom swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped\\nbehind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner\\ntold their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his\\ndrug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the\\nbell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\\n\\n\\nHis manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see\\nme. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an\\narmchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a\\ngasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his\\nsingular introspective fashion.\\n\\n\\n“Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Watson, that you\\nhave put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.”\\n\\n\\n“Seven!” I answered.\\n\\n\\n“Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I\\nfancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you\\nintended to go into harness.”\\n\\n\\n“Then, how do you know?”\\n\\n\\n“I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself\\nvery wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant\\ngirl?”\\n\\n\\n“My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would\\ncertainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that\\nI had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I\\nhave changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary\\nJane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again,\\nI fail to see how you work it out.”\\n\\n\\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\\n\\n\\n“It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on\\nthe inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather\\nis scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by\\nsomeone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to\\nremove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had\\nbeen out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant\\nboot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a\\ngentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of\\nnitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of\\nhis top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull,\\nindeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical\\nprofession.”\\n\\n\\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of\\ndeduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked,\\n“the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could\\neasily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am\\nbaffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as\\ngood as yours.”\\n\\n\\n“Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\\ndown into an armchair. “You see, but you do not observe. The distinction\\nis clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from\\nthe hall to this room.”\\n\\n\\n“Frequently.”\\n\\n\\n“How often?”\\n\\n\\n“Well, some hundreds of times.”\\n\\n\\n“Then how many are there?”\\n\\n\\n“How many? I don’t know.”\\n\\n\\n“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my\\npoint. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and\\nobserved. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and\\nsince you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences,\\nyou may be interested in this.” He threw over a sheet of thick,\\npink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table. “It came\\nby the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.”\\n\\n\\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address.\\n\\n\\n“There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight\\no’clock,” it said, “a gentleman who desires to consult you\\nupon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the\\nroyal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted\\nwith matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This\\naccount of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at\\nthat hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.”\\n\\n\\n“This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imagine\\nthat it means?”\\n\\n\\n“I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has\\ndata. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of\\ntheories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?”\\n\\n\\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.\\n\\n\\n“The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked,\\nendeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes. “Such paper could\\nnot be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and\\nstiff.”\\n\\n\\n“Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It is\\nnot an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light.”\\n\\n\\nI did so, and saw a large “E” with a small “g,” a\\n“P,” and a large “G” with a small “t” woven\\ninto the texture of the paper.\\n\\n\\n“What do you make of that?” asked Holmes.\\n\\n\\n“The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.”\\n\\n\\n“Not at all. The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands\\nfor ‘Gesellschaft,’ which is the German for ‘Company.’\\nIt is a customary contraction like our ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ of\\ncourse, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us\\nglance at our Continental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy brown volume\\nfrom his shelves. “Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a\\nGerman-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad.\\n‘Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its\\nnumerous glass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you\\nmake of that?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant\\ncloud from his cigarette.\\n\\n\\n“The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said.\\n\\n\\n“Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the\\npeculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we have\\nfrom all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have\\nwritten that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only\\nremains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon\\nBohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he\\ncomes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.”\\n\\n\\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating wheels\\nagainst the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.\\n\\n\\n“A pair, by the sound,” said he. “Yes,” he continued,\\nglancing out of the window. “A nice little brougham and a pair of\\nbeauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There’s money in this case,\\nWatson, if there is nothing else.”\\n\\n\\n“I think that I had better go, Holmes.”\\n\\n\\n“Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And\\nthis promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.”\\n\\n\\n“But your client—”\\n\\n\\n“Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit\\ndown in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.”\\n\\n\\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage,\\npaused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative\\ntap.\\n\\n\\n“Come in!” said Holmes.\\n\\n\\nA man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in\\nheight, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a\\nrichness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy\\nbands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his\\ndouble-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his\\nshoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a\\nbrooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway\\nup his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur,\\ncompleted the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole\\nappearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across\\nthe upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard\\nmask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still\\nraised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a\\nman of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin\\nsuggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.\\n\\n\\n“You had my note?” he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly\\nmarked German accent. “I told you that I would call.” He looked\\nfrom one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\\n\\n\\n“Pray take a seat,” said Holmes. “This is my friend and\\ncolleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases.\\nWhom have I the honour to address?”\\n\\n\\n“You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I\\nunderstand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion,\\nwhom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should\\nmuch prefer to communicate with you alone.”\\n\\n\\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my\\nchair. “It is both, or none,” said he. “You may say before\\nthis gentleman anything which you may say to me.”\\n\\n\\nThe Count shrugged his broad shoulders. “Then I must begin,” said\\nhe, “by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of\\nthat time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to\\nsay that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European\\nhistory.”\\n\\n\\n“I promise,” said Holmes.\\n\\n\\n“And I.”\\n\\n\\n“You will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor.\\n“The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you,\\nand I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is\\nnot exactly my own.”\\n\\n\\n“I was aware of it,” said Holmes dryly.\\n\\n\\n“The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be\\ntaken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously\\ncompromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter\\nimplicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.”\\n\\n\\n“I was also aware of that,” murmured Holmes, settling himself down\\nin his armchair and closing his eyes.\\n\\n\\nOur visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure\\nof the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner\\nand most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked\\nimpatiently at his gigantic client.\\n\\n\\n“If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,” he remarked,\\n“I should be better able to advise you.”\\n\\n\\nThe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable\\nagitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face\\nand hurled it upon the ground. “You are right,” he cried; “I\\nam the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?”\\n\\n\\n“Why, indeed?” murmured Holmes. “Your Majesty had not spoken\\nbefore I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von\\nOrmstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia.”\\n\\n\\n“But you can understand,” said our strange visitor, sitting down\\nonce more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, “you can\\nunderstand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person.\\nYet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without\\nputting myself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the\\npurpose of consulting you.”\\n\\n\\n“Then, pray consult,” said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\\n\\n\\n“The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit\\nto Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler.\\nThe name is no doubt familiar to you.”\\n\\n\\n“Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,” murmured Holmes without\\nopening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all\\nparagraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a\\nsubject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this\\ncase I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and\\nthat of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.\\n\\n\\n“Let me see!” said Holmes. “Hum! Born in New Jersey in the\\nyear 1858. Contralto—hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of\\nWarsaw—yes! Retired from operatic stage—ha! Living in\\nLondon—quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with\\nthis young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of\\ngetting those letters back.”\\n\\n\\n“Precisely so. But how—”\\n\\n\\n“Was there a secret marriage?”\\n\\n\\n“None.”\\n\\n\\n“No legal papers or certificates?”\\n\\n\\n“None.”\\n\\n\\n“Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce\\nher letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their\\nauthenticity?”\\n\\n\\n“There is the writing.”\\n\\n\\n“Pooh, pooh! Forgery.”\\n\\n\\n“My private note-paper.”\\n\\n\\n“Stolen.”\\n\\n\\n“My own seal.”\\n\\n\\n“Imitated.”\\n\\n\\n“My photograph.”\\n\\n\\n“Bought.”\\n\\n\\n“We were both in the photograph.”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an\\nindiscretion.”\\n\\n\\n“I was mad—insane.”\\n\\n\\n“You have compromised yourself seriously.”\\n\\n\\n“I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.”\\n\\n\\n“It must be recovered.”\\n\\n\\n“We have tried and failed.”\\n\\n\\n“Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.”\\n\\n\\n“She will not sell.”\\n\\n\\n“Stolen, then.”\\n\\n\\n“Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her\\nhouse. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been\\nwaylaid. There has been no result.”\\n\\n\\n“No sign of it?”\\n\\n\\n“Absolutely none.”\\n\\n\\nHolmes laughed. “It is quite a pretty little problem,” said he.\\n\\n\\n“But a very serious one to me,” returned the King reproachfully.\\n\\n\\n“Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the\\nphotograph?”\\n\\n\\n“To ruin me.”\\n\\n\\n“But how?”\\n\\n\\n“I am about to be married.”\\n\\n\\n“So I have heard.”\\n\\n\\n“To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of\\nScandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herself\\nthe very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the\\nmatter to an end.”\\n\\n\\n“And Irene Adler?”\\n\\n\\n“Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that\\nshe will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the\\nface of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men.\\nRather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she\\nwould not go—none.”\\n\\n\\n“You are sure that she has not sent it yet?”\\n\\n\\n“I am sure.”\\n\\n\\n“And why?”\\n\\n\\n“Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the\\nbetrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, then we have three days yet,” said Holmes with a yawn.\\n“That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to\\nlook into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the\\npresent?”\\n\\n\\n“Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count\\nVon Kramm.”\\n\\n\\n“Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.”\\n\\n\\n“Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.”\\n\\n\\n“Then, as to money?”\\n\\n\\n“You have carte blanche.”\\n\\n\\n“Absolutely?”\\n\\n\\n“I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have\\nthat photograph.”\\n\\n\\n“And for present expenses?”\\n\\n\\nThe King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on\\nthe table.\\n\\n\\n“There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in\\nnotes,” he said.\\n\\n\\nHolmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him.\\n\\n\\n“And Mademoiselle’s address?” he asked.\\n\\n\\n“Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John’s Wood.”\\n\\n\\nHolmes took a note of it. “One other question,” said he. “Was\\nthe photograph a cabinet?”\\n\\n\\n“It was.”\\n\\n\\n“Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some\\ngood news for you. And good-night, Watson,” he added, as the wheels of\\nthe royal brougham rolled down the street. “If you will be good enough to\\ncall to-morrow afternoon at three o’clock I should like to chat this\\nlittle matter over with you.”\\n\\n\\nAt three o’clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet\\nreturned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after\\neight o’clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with\\nthe intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply\\ninterested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim\\nand strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have\\nalready recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his\\nclient gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the\\ninvestigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly\\ngrasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a\\npleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle\\nmethods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed\\nwas I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had\\nceased to enter into my head.\\n\\n\\nIt was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom,\\nill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes,\\nwalked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my friend’s amazing powers\\nin the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it\\nwas indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in\\nfive minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into\\nhis pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed\\nheartily for some minutes.\\n\\n\\n“Well, really!” he cried, and then he choked and laughed again\\nuntil he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.\\n\\n\\n“What is it?”\\n\\n\\n“It’s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I\\nemployed my morning, or what I ended by doing.”\\n\\n\\n“I can’t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits,\\nand perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.”\\n\\n\\n“Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I\\nleft the house a little after eight o’clock this morning in the character\\nof a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among\\nhorsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon\\nfound Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but\\nbuilt out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door.\\nLarge sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost\\nto the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child\\ncould open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window\\ncould be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and\\nexamined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else\\nof interest.\\n\\n\\n“I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was\\na mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers\\na hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass\\nof half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could\\ndesire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the\\nneighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies\\nI was compelled to listen to.”\\n\\n\\n“And what of Irene Adler?” I asked.\\n\\n\\n“Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part. She is\\nthe daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews,\\nto a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day,\\nand returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except\\nwhen she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark,\\nhandsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is\\na Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a\\nconfidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and\\nknew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to\\nwalk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of\\ncampaign.\\n\\n\\n“This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He\\nwas a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between them, and\\nwhat the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his\\nmistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his\\nkeeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question\\ndepended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my\\nattention to the gentleman’s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate\\npoint, and it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with\\nthese details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to\\nunderstand the situation.”\\n\\n\\n“I am following you closely,” I answered.\\n\\n\\n“I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up\\nto Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome man,\\ndark, aquiline, and moustached—evidently the man of whom I had heard. He\\nappeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed\\npast the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at\\nhome.\\n\\n\\n“He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of\\nhim in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly,\\nand waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking\\neven more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold\\nwatch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, ‘Drive like the\\ndevil,’ he shouted, ‘first to Gross & Hankey’s in Regent\\nStreet, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a\\nguinea if you do it in twenty minutes!’\\n\\n\\n“Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to\\nfollow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his\\ncoat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his\\nharness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn’t pulled up before she\\nshot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the\\nmoment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.\\n\\n\\n“‘The Church of St. Monica, John,’ she cried,\\n‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.’\\n\\n\\n“This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I\\nshould run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came\\nthrough the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped\\nin before he could object. ‘The Church of St. Monica,’ said I,\\n‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.’ It was\\ntwenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in\\nthe wind.\\n\\n\\n“My cabby drove fast. I don’t think I ever drove faster, but the\\nothers were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses\\nwere in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the\\nchurch. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a\\nsurpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all\\nthree standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle\\nlike any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise,\\nthe three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as\\nhard as he could towards me.\\n\\n\\n“‘Thank God,’ he cried. ‘You’ll do. Come!\\nCome!’\\n\\n\\n“‘What then?’ I asked.\\n\\n\\n“‘Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won’t be\\nlegal.’\\n\\n\\n“I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I\\nfound myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching\\nfor things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying\\nup of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an\\ninstant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady\\non the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most\\npreposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the\\nthought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been\\nsome informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to\\nmarry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved\\nthe bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best\\nman. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch chain in\\nmemory of the occasion.”\\n\\n\\n“This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,” said I; “and\\nwhat then?”\\n\\n\\n“Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair\\nmight take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic\\nmeasures on my part. At the church door, however, they separated, he driving\\nback to the Temple, and she to her own house. ‘I shall drive out in the\\npark at five as usual,’ she said as she left him. I heard no more. They\\ndrove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own\\narrangements.”\\n\\n\\n“Which are?”\\n\\n\\n“Some cold beef and a glass of beer,” he answered, ringing the\\nbell. “I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be\\nbusier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your\\nco-operation.”\\n\\n\\n“I shall be delighted.”\\n\\n\\n“You don’t mind breaking the law?”\\n\\n\\n“Not in the least.”\\n\\n\\n“Nor running a chance of arrest?”\\n\\n\\n“Not in a good cause.”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, the cause is excellent!”\\n\\n\\n“Then I am your man.”\\n\\n\\n“I was sure that I might rely on you.”\\n\\n\\n“But what is it you wish?”\\n\\n\\n“When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you.\\nNow,” he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady\\nhad provided, “I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time.\\nIt is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss\\nIrene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony\\nLodge to meet her.”\\n\\n\\n“And what then?”\\n\\n\\n“You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur.\\nThere is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come\\nwhat may. You understand?”\\n\\n\\n“I am to be neutral?”\\n\\n\\n“To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small\\nunpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into the\\nhouse. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open. You\\nare to station yourself close to that open window.”\\n\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n\\n“You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.”\\n\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n\\n“And when I raise my hand—so—you will throw into the room\\nwhat I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire.\\nYou quite follow me?”\\n\\n\\n“Entirely.”\\n\\n\\n“It is nothing very formidable,” he said, taking a long\\ncigar-shaped roll from his pocket. “It is an ordinary plumber’s\\nsmoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your\\ntask is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up\\nby quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I\\nwill rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?”\\n\\n\\n“I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the\\nsignal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you\\nat the corner of the street.”\\n\\n\\n“Precisely.”\\n\\n\\n“Then you may entirely rely on me.”\\n\\n\\n“That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare\\nfor the new role I have to play.”\\n\\n\\nHe disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character\\nof an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His broad black hat,\\nhis baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of\\npeering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have\\nequalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression,\\nhis manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed.\\nThe stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he\\nbecame a specialist in crime.\\n\\n\\nIt was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten\\nminutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was\\nalready dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in\\nfront of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was\\njust such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes’ succinct\\ndescription, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On\\nthe contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably\\nanimated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a\\ncorner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with\\na nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down\\nwith cigars in their mouths.\\n\\n\\n“You see,” remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the\\nhouse, “this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a\\ndouble-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its\\nbeing seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of\\nhis princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?”\\n\\n\\n“Where, indeed?”\\n\\n\\n“It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet\\nsize. Too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows\\nthat the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of\\nthe sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry\\nit about with her.”\\n\\n\\n“Where, then?”\\n\\n\\n“Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am\\ninclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do\\ntheir own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could\\ntrust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political\\ninfluence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that\\nshe had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her\\nhands upon it. It must be in her own house.”\\n\\n\\n“But it has twice been burgled.”\\n\\n\\n“Pshaw! They did not know how to look.”\\n\\n\\n“But how will you look?”\\n\\n\\n“I will not look.”\\n\\n\\n“What then?”\\n\\n\\n“I will get her to show me.”\\n\\n\\n“But she will refuse.”\\n\\n\\n“She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her\\ncarriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.”\\n\\n\\nAs he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of\\nthe avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony\\nLodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to\\nopen the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another\\nloafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out,\\nwhich was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the\\nloungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side.\\nA blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her\\ncarriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who\\nstruck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into\\nthe crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her, he gave a cry and\\ndropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall\\nthe guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the\\nother, while a number of better dressed people, who had watched the scuffle\\nwithout taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the\\ninjured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps;\\nbut she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of\\nthe hall, looking back into the street.\\n\\n\\n“Is the poor gentleman much hurt?” she asked.\\n\\n\\n“He is dead,” cried several voices.\\n\\n\\n“No, no, there’s life in him!” shouted another. “But\\nhe’ll be gone before you can get him to hospital.”\\n\\n\\n“He’s a brave fellow,” said a woman. “They would have\\nhad the lady’s purse and watch if it hadn’t been for him. They were\\na gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he’s breathing now.”\\n\\n\\n“He can’t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?”\\n\\n\\n“Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa.\\nThis way, please!”\\n\\n\\nSlowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the\\nprincipal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the\\nwindow. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I\\ncould see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized\\nwith compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I\\nnever felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the\\nbeautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness\\nwith which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest\\ntreachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to\\nme. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After\\nall, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from\\ninjuring another.\\n\\n\\nHolmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in\\nneed of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same\\ninstant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the\\nroom with a cry of “Fire!” The word was no sooner out of my mouth\\nthan the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill—gentlemen,\\nostlers, and servant maids—joined in a general shriek of\\n“Fire!” Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at\\nthe open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the\\nvoice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping\\nthrough the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in\\nten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm in mine, and to get away\\nfrom the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes\\nuntil we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the\\nEdgeware Road.\\n\\n\\n“You did it very nicely, Doctor,” he remarked. “Nothing could\\nhave been better. It is all right.”\\n\\n\\n“You have the photograph?”\\n\\n\\n“I know where it is.”\\n\\n\\n“And how did you find out?”\\n\\n\\n“She showed me, as I told you she would.”\\n\\n\\n“I am still in the dark.”\\n\\n\\n“I do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laughing. “The\\nmatter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street\\nwas an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.”\\n\\n\\n“I guessed as much.”\\n\\n\\n“Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm\\nof my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became\\na piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.”\\n\\n\\n“That also I could fathom.”\\n\\n\\n“Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could\\nshe do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected.\\nIt lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which. They\\nlaid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window,\\nand you had your chance.”\\n\\n\\n“How did that help you?”\\n\\n\\n“It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her\\ninstinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a\\nperfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of\\nit. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me, and\\nalso in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an\\nunmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady\\nof to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in\\nquest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done.\\nThe smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded\\nbeautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above\\nthe right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it\\nas she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she\\nreplaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen\\nher since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated\\nwhether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come\\nin, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. A little\\nover-precipitance may ruin all.”\\n\\n\\n“And now?” I asked.\\n\\n\\n“Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King to-morrow,\\nand with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the\\nsitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she\\nmay find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his\\nMajesty to regain it with his own hands.”\\n\\n\\n“And when will you call?”\\n\\n\\n“At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a\\nclear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete\\nchange in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without delay.”\\n\\n\\nWe had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was searching his\\npockets for the key when someone passing said:\\n\\n\\n“Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.”\\n\\n\\nThere were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting\\nappeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.\\n\\n\\n“I’ve heard that voice before,” said Holmes, staring down the\\ndimly lit street. “Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have\\nbeen.”\\n\\n\\nI slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and\\ncoffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.\\n\\n\\n“You have really got it!” he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by\\neither shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.\\n\\n\\n“Not yet.”\\n\\n\\n“But you have hopes?”\\n\\n\\n“I have hopes.”\\n\\n\\n“Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.”\\n\\n\\n“We must have a cab.”\\n\\n\\n“No, my brougham is waiting.”\\n\\n\\n“Then that will simplify matters.” We descended and started off\\nonce more for Briony Lodge.\\n\\n\\n“Irene Adler is married,” remarked Holmes.\\n\\n\\n“Married! When?”\\n\\n\\n“Yesterday.”\\n\\n\\n“But to whom?”\\n\\n\\n“To an English lawyer named Norton.”\\n\\n\\n“But she could not love him.”\\n\\n\\n“I am in hopes that she does.”\\n\\n\\n“And why in hopes?”\\n\\n\\n“Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If the\\nlady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does not love\\nyour Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your\\nMajesty’s plan.”\\n\\n\\n“It is true. And yet—! Well! I wish she had been of my own station!\\nWhat a queen she would have made!” He relapsed into a moody silence,\\nwhich was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.\\n\\n\\nThe door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps.\\nShe watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.\\n\\n\\n“Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?” said she.\\n\\n\\n“I am Mr. Holmes,” answered my companion, looking at her with a\\nquestioning and rather startled gaze.\\n\\n\\n“Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left this\\nmorning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for the\\nContinent.”\\n\\n\\n“What!” Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and\\nsurprise. “Do you mean that she has left England?”\\n\\n\\n“Never to return.”\\n\\n\\n“And the papers?” asked the King hoarsely. “All is\\nlost.”\\n\\n\\n“We shall see.” He pushed past the servant and rushed into the\\ndrawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was scattered\\nabout in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the\\nlady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at the\\nbell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled\\nout a photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in\\nevening dress, the letter was superscribed to “Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To\\nbe left till called for.” My friend tore it open, and we all three read\\nit together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this\\nway:\\n\\n\\n“MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—You really did it very well. You took\\nme in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion. But\\nthen, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been\\nwarned against you months ago. I had been told that, if the King employed an\\nagent, it would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with\\nall this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became\\nsuspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman.\\nBut, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is\\nnothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent\\nJohn, the coachman, to watch you, ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as\\nI call them, and came down just as you departed.\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0“Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an\\nobject of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather\\nimprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my\\nhusband.\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0“We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by\\nso formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call\\nto-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am\\nloved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without hindrance\\nfrom one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and\\nto preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might\\ntake in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I\\nremain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\\n\\n\\n“Very truly yours,\\n“IRENE NORTON, nÃ©e ADLER.”\\n\\n\\n“What a woman—oh, what a woman!” cried the King of Bohemia,\\nwhen we had all three read this epistle. “Did I not tell you how quick\\nand resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a\\npity that she was not on my level?”\\n\\n\\n“From what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very\\ndifferent level to your Majesty,” said Holmes coldly. “I am sorry\\nthat I have not been able to bring your Majesty’s business to a more\\nsuccessful conclusion.”\\n\\n\\n“On the contrary, my dear sir,” cried the King; “nothing\\ncould be more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is\\nnow as safe as if it were in the fire.”\\n\\n\\n“I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.”\\n\\n\\n“I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward\\nyou. This ring—” He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger\\nand held it out upon the palm of his hand.\\n\\n\\n“Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,”\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\\n\\n“You have but to name it.”\\n\\n\\n“This photograph!”\\n\\n\\nThe King stared at him in amazement.\\n\\n\\n“Irene’s photograph!” he cried. “Certainly, if you wish\\nit.”\\n\\n\\n“I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I\\nhave the honour to wish you a very good morning.” He bowed, and, turning\\naway without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him, he set\\noff in my company for his chambers.\\n\\n\\nAnd that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia,\\nand how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman’s\\nwit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard\\nhim do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her\\nphotograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.\\n',\n",

       "  'body': '\\nOn glancing over my\\nnotes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years\\nstudied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some\\ncomic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he\\ndid rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he\\nrefused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards\\nthe unusual, and even the fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I\\ncannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was\\nassociated with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran.\\nThe events in question occurred in the early days of my association with\\nHolmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is possible\\nthat I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was\\nmade at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by\\nthe untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It is perhaps as\\nwell that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that\\nthere are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend\\nto make the matter even more terrible than the truth.\\n\\n\\nIt was early in April in the year ’83 that I woke one morning to find\\nSherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a late\\nriser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was\\nonly a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps\\njust a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.\\n\\n\\n“Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,” said he, “but\\nit’s the common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she\\nretorted upon me, and I on you.”\\n\\n\\n“What is it, then—a fire?”\\n\\n\\n“No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable\\nstate of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in the\\nsitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour\\nof the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it\\nis something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it prove to\\nbe an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the\\noutset. I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the\\nchance.”\\n\\n\\n“My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.”\\n\\n\\nI had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional\\ninvestigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions,\\nand yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems\\nwhich were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a\\nfew minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in\\nblack and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we\\nentered.\\n\\n\\n“Good-morning, madam,” said Holmes cheerily. “My name is\\nSherlock Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before\\nwhom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs.\\nHudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and I\\nshall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are\\nshivering.”\\n\\n\\n“It is not cold which makes me shiver,” said the woman in a low\\nvoice, changing her seat as requested.\\n\\n\\n“What, then?”\\n\\n\\n“It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.” She raised her veil as she\\nspoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation,\\nher face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some\\nhunted animal. Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her\\nhair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard.\\nSherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.\\n\\n\\n“You must not fear,” said he soothingly, bending forward and\\npatting her forearm. “We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt.\\nYou have come in by train this morning, I see.”\\n\\n\\n“You know me, then?”\\n\\n\\n“No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your\\nleft glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a\\ndog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station.”\\n\\n\\nThe lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.\\n\\n\\n“There is no mystery, my dear madam,” said he, smiling. “The\\nleft arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The\\nmarks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up\\nmud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the\\ndriver.”\\n\\n\\n“Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,” said\\nshe. “I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past,\\nand came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no\\nlonger; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to—none,\\nsave only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I\\nhave heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom\\nyou helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had your\\naddress. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least\\nthrow a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me? At present\\nit is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six\\nweeks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least\\nyou shall not find me ungrateful.”\\n\\n\\nHolmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which\\nhe consulted.\\n\\n\\n“Farintosh,” said he. “Ah yes, I recall the case; it was\\nconcerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can\\nonly say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as\\nI did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own reward;\\nbut you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time\\nwhich suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that\\nmay help us in forming an opinion upon the matter.”\\n\\n\\n“Alas!” replied our visitor, “the very horror of my situation\\nlies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so\\nentirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he\\nto whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all\\nthat I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so,\\nbut I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have heard,\\nMr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human\\nheart. You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass\\nme.”\\n\\n\\n“I am all attention, madam.”\\n\\n\\n“My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the\\nlast survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of\\nStoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.”\\n\\n\\nHolmes nodded his head. “The name is familiar to me,” said he.\\n\\n\\n“The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the estates\\nextended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in the\\nwest. In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute\\nand wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a\\ngambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of\\nground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a\\nheavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the\\nhorrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather,\\nseeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance\\nfrom a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to\\nCalcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he\\nestablished a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused by some\\nrobberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to\\ndeath and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long\\nterm of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and\\ndisappointed man.\\n\\n\\n“When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the\\nyoung widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister Julia\\nand I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my\\nmother’s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money—not less\\nthan Â£ 1000 a year—and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while\\nwe resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be\\nallowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return to\\nEngland my mother died—she was killed eight years ago in a railway\\naccident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish\\nhimself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestral\\nhouse at Stoke Moran. The money which my mother had left was enough for all our\\nwants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.\\n\\n\\n“But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time. Instead\\nof making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first\\nbeen overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he\\nshut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious\\nquarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper approaching to\\nmania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my\\nstepfather’s case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long\\nresidence in the tropics. A series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of\\nwhich ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the\\nvillage, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense\\nstrength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.\\n\\n\\n“Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream,\\nand it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that\\nI was able to avert another public exposure. He had no friends at all save the\\nwandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the\\nfew acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would\\naccept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them\\nsometimes for weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are\\nsent over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a\\nbaboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers\\nalmost as much as their master.\\n\\n\\n“You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no\\ngreat pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a long time\\nwe did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the time of her death,\\nand yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has.”\\n\\n\\n“Your sister is dead, then?”\\n\\n\\n“She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to speak\\nto you. You can understand that, living the life which I have described, we\\nwere little likely to see anyone of our own age and position. We had, however,\\nan aunt, my mother’s maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives\\nnear Harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this\\nlady’s house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there\\na half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My stepfather learned\\nof the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the\\nmarriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the\\nwedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only\\ncompanion.”\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his\\nhead sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at\\nhis visitor.\\n\\n\\n“Pray be precise as to details,” said he.\\n\\n\\n“It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is\\nseared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very old,\\nand only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are on the ground\\nfloor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings. Of these\\nbedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott’s, the second my sister’s, and\\nthe third my own. There is no communication between them, but they all open out\\ninto the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?”\\n\\n\\n“Perfectly so.”\\n\\n\\n“The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal night\\nDr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not retired\\nto rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars\\nwhich it was his custom to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into\\nmine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At\\neleven o’clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and\\nlooked back.\\n\\n\\n“‘Tell me, Helen,’ said she, ‘have you ever heard\\nanyone whistle in the dead of the night?’\\n\\n\\n“‘Never,’ said I.\\n\\n\\n“‘I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in\\nyour sleep?’\\n\\n\\n“‘Certainly not. But why?’\\n\\n\\n“‘Because during the last few nights I have always, about\\nthree in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it\\nhas awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from—perhaps from the next\\nroom, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you whether you\\nhad heard it.’\\n\\n\\n“‘No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the\\nplantation.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that\\nyou did not hear it also.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.’\\nShe smiled back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key\\nturn in the lock.”\\n\\n\\n“Indeed,” said Holmes. “Was it your custom always to lock\\nyourselves in at night?”\\n\\n\\n“Always.”\\n\\n\\n“And why?”\\n\\n\\n“I think that I mentioned to you that the Doctor kept a cheetah and a\\nbaboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.”\\n\\n\\n“Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.”\\n\\n\\n“I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune\\nimpressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how\\nsubtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied. It was a\\nwild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and\\nsplashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there\\nburst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew that it was my\\nsister’s voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and\\nrushed into the corridor. As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle,\\nsuch as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a\\nmass of metal had fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister’s door was\\nunlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken,\\nnot knowing what was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp\\nI saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands\\ngroping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard.\\nI ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed\\nto give way and she fell to the ground. She writhed as one who is in terrible\\npain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had\\nnot recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice\\nwhich I shall never forget, ‘Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The\\nspeckled band!’ There was something else which she would fain have said,\\nand she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the\\nDoctor’s room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I\\nrushed out, calling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his\\nroom in his dressing-gown. When he reached my sister’s side she was\\nunconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical\\naid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died\\nwithout having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my\\nbeloved sister.”\\n\\n\\n“One moment,” said Holmes, “are you sure about this whistle\\nand metallic sound? Could you swear to it?”\\n\\n\\n“That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my\\nstrong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the\\ncreaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.”\\n\\n\\n“Was your sister dressed?”\\n\\n\\n“No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the charred\\nstump of a match, and in her left a match-box.”\\n\\n\\n“Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm\\ntook place. That is important. And what conclusions did the coroner come\\nto?”\\n\\n\\n“He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott’s\\nconduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any\\nsatisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been fastened\\nupon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters\\nwith broad iron bars, which were secured every night. The walls were carefully\\nsounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also\\nthoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred\\nup by four large staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite\\nalone when she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon\\nher.”\\n\\n\\n“How about poison?”\\n\\n\\n“The doctors examined her for it, but without success.”\\n\\n\\n“What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?”\\n\\n\\n“It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though\\nwhat it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.”\\n\\n\\n“Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, there are nearly always some there.”\\n\\n\\n“Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band—a\\nspeckled band?”\\n\\n\\n“Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium,\\nsometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these\\nvery gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs\\nwhich so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange\\nadjective which she used.”\\n\\n\\nHolmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.\\n\\n\\n“These are very deep waters,” said he; “pray go on with your\\nnarrative.”\\n\\n\\n“Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately\\nlonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for\\nmany years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage. His name is\\nArmitage—Percy Armitage—the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane\\nWater, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and\\nwe are to be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs\\nwere started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been\\npierced, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died,\\nand to sleep in the very bed in which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of\\nterror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I\\nsuddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the\\nherald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be\\nseen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed,\\nand as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn,\\nwhich is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on this\\nmorning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice.”\\n\\n\\n“You have done wisely,” said my friend. “But have you told me\\nall?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, all.”\\n\\n\\n“Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.”\\n\\n\\n“Why, what do you mean?”\\n\\n\\nFor answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand\\nthat lay upon our visitor’s knee. Five little livid spots, the marks of\\nfour fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.\\n\\n\\n“You have been cruelly used,” said Holmes.\\n\\n\\nThe lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. “He is a\\nhard man,” she said, “and perhaps he hardly knows his own\\nstrength.”\\n\\n\\nThere was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands\\nand stared into the crackling fire.\\n\\n\\n“This is a very deep business,” he said at last. “There are a\\nthousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course\\nof action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to Stoke Moran\\nto-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the\\nknowledge of your stepfather?”\\n\\n\\n“As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most\\nimportant business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and that there\\nwould be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now, but she is old and\\nfoolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.”\\n\\n\\n“Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?”\\n\\n\\n“By no means.”\\n\\n\\n“Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?”\\n\\n\\n“I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town.\\nBut I shall return by the twelve o’clock train, so as to be there in time\\nfor your coming.”\\n\\n\\n“And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small\\nbusiness matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?”\\n\\n\\n“No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my\\ntrouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon.”\\nShe dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room.\\n\\n\\n“And what do you think of it all, Watson?” asked Sherlock Holmes,\\nleaning back in his chair.\\n\\n\\n“It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.”\\n\\n\\n“Dark enough and sinister enough.”\\n\\n\\n“Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are\\nsound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her sister\\nmust have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end.”\\n\\n\\n“What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very\\npeculiar words of the dying woman?”\\n\\n\\n“I cannot think.”\\n\\n\\n“When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band\\nof gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we\\nhave every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his\\nstepdaughter’s marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the\\nfact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been\\ncaused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into\\nits place, I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be\\ncleared along those lines.”\\n\\n\\n“But what, then, did the gipsies do?”\\n\\n\\n“I cannot imagine.”\\n\\n\\n“I see many objections to any such theory.”\\n\\n\\n“And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke\\nMoran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may\\nbe explained away. But what in the name of the devil!”\\n\\n\\nThe ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had\\nbeen suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the\\naperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the\\nagricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high\\ngaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his hat\\nactually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span\\nit across from side to side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles,\\nburned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from\\none to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,\\nfleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.\\n\\n\\n“Which of you is Holmes?” asked this apparition.\\n\\n\\n“My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,” said my companion\\nquietly.\\n\\n\\n“I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.”\\n\\n\\n“Indeed, Doctor,” said Holmes blandly. “Pray take a\\nseat.”\\n\\n\\n“I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have\\ntraced her. What has she been saying to you?”\\n\\n\\n“It is a little cold for the time of the year,” said Holmes.\\n\\n\\n“What has she been saying to you?” screamed the old man furiously.\\n\\n\\n“But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,” continued my\\ncompanion imperturbably.\\n\\n\\n“Ha! You put me off, do you?” said our new visitor, taking a step\\nforward and shaking his hunting-crop. “I know you, you scoundrel! I have\\nheard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.”\\n\\n\\nMy friend smiled.\\n\\n\\n“Holmes, the busybody!”\\n\\n\\nHis smile broadened.\\n\\n\\n“Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!”\\n\\n\\nHolmes chuckled heartily. “Your conversation is most entertaining,”\\nsaid he. “When you go out close the door, for there is a decided\\ndraught.”\\n\\n\\n“I will go when I have had my say. Don’t you dare to meddle with my\\naffairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a dangerous\\nman to fall foul of! See here.” He stepped swiftly forward, seized the\\npoker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.\\n\\n\\n“See that you keep yourself out of my grip,” he snarled, and\\nhurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.\\n\\n\\n“He seems a very amiable person,” said Holmes, laughing. “I\\nam not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my\\ngrip was not much more feeble than his own.” As he spoke he picked up the\\nsteel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.\\n\\n\\n“Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official\\ndetective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I\\nonly trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in\\nallowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we shall order breakfast,\\nand afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors’ Commons, where I hope to get\\nsome data which may help us in this matter.”\\n\\n\\nIt was nearly one o’clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his\\nexcursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes\\nand figures.\\n\\n\\n“I have seen the will of the deceased wife,” said he. “To\\ndetermine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices\\nof the investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the\\ntime of the wife’s death was little short of Â£ 1,100, is now, through the\\nfall in agricultural prices, not more than Â£ 750. Each daughter can claim an\\nincome of Â£ 250, in case of marriage. It is evident, therefore, that if both\\ngirls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one\\nof them would cripple him to a very serious extent. My morning’s work has\\nnot been wasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for\\nstanding in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too\\nserious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are\\ninteresting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab\\nand drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your\\nrevolver into your pocket. An Eley’s No. 2 is an excellent argument with\\ngentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush are, I\\nthink, all that we need.”\\n\\n\\nAt Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead, where we\\nhired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the\\nlovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy\\nclouds in the heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out\\ntheir first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the\\nmoist earth. To me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet\\npromise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My\\ncompanion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down\\nover his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest\\nthought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed\\nover the meadows.\\n\\n\\n“Look there!” said he.\\n\\n\\nA heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove\\nat the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables\\nand high roof-tree of a very old mansion.\\n\\n\\n“Stoke Moran?” said he.\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,” remarked the\\ndriver.\\n\\n\\n“There is some building going on there,” said Holmes; “that\\nis where we are going.”\\n\\n\\n“There’s the village,” said the driver, pointing to a cluster\\nof roofs some distance to the left; “but if you want to get to the house,\\nyou’ll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the footpath\\nover the fields. There it is, where the lady is walking.”\\n\\n\\n“And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,” observed Holmes, shading\\nhis eyes. “Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.”\\n\\n\\nWe got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead.\\n\\n\\n“I thought it as well,” said Holmes as we climbed the stile,\\n“that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some\\ndefinite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see\\nthat we have been as good as our word.”\\n\\n\\nOur client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which\\nspoke her joy. “I have been waiting so eagerly for you,” she cried,\\nshaking hands with us warmly. “All has turned out splendidly. Dr. Roylott\\nhas gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before\\nevening.”\\n\\n\\n“We have had the pleasure of making the Doctor’s\\nacquaintance,” said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had\\noccurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\\n\\n\\n“Good heavens!” she cried, “he has followed me, then.”\\n\\n\\n“So it appears.”\\n\\n\\n“He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will he\\nsay when he returns?”\\n\\n\\n“He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more\\ncunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him\\nto-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt’s at\\nHarrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once\\nto the rooms which we are to examine.”\\n\\n\\nThe building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion\\nand two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. In\\none of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards,\\nwhile the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was\\nin little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and\\nthe blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys,\\nshowed that this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been\\nerected against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but\\nthere were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked\\nslowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the\\noutsides of the windows.\\n\\n\\n“This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the\\ncentre one to your sister’s, and the one next to the main building to Dr.\\nRoylott’s chamber?”\\n\\n\\n“Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.”\\n\\n\\n“Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not\\nseem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.”\\n\\n\\n“There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my\\nroom.”\\n\\n\\n“Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs\\nthe corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows in it, of\\ncourse?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through.”\\n\\n\\n“As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable\\nfrom that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar\\nyour shutters?”\\n\\n\\nMiss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the open\\nwindow, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but without\\nsuccess. There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the\\nbar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron,\\nbuilt firmly into the massive masonry. “Hum!” said he, scratching\\nhis chin in some perplexity, “my theory certainly presents some\\ndifficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted. Well, we\\nshall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter.”\\n\\n\\nA small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three\\nbedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at\\nonce to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in which\\nher sister had met with her fate. It was a homely little room, with a low\\nceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A\\nbrown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in\\nanother, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These\\narticles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the\\nroom save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and the\\npanelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured\\nthat it may have dated from the original building of the house. Holmes drew one\\nof the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and\\nround and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.\\n\\n\\n“Where does that bell communicate with?” he asked at last pointing\\nto a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying\\nupon the pillow.\\n\\n\\n“It goes to the housekeeper’s room.”\\n\\n\\n“It looks newer than the other things?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.”\\n\\n\\n“Your sister asked for it, I suppose?”\\n\\n\\n“No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we wanted\\nfor ourselves.”\\n\\n\\n“Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You will\\nexcuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor.” He\\nthrew himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly\\nbackward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he\\ndid the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he\\nwalked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his\\neye up and down the wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it\\na brisk tug.\\n\\n\\n“Why, it’s a dummy,” said he.\\n\\n\\n“Won’t it ring?”\\n\\n\\n“No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can\\nsee now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for\\nthe ventilator is.”\\n\\n\\n“How very absurd! I never noticed that before.”\\n\\n\\n“Very strange!” muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. “There\\nare one or two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a\\nbuilder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same\\ntrouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!”\\n\\n\\n“That is also quite modern,” said the lady.\\n\\n\\n“Done about the same time as the bell-rope?” remarked Holmes.\\n\\n\\n“Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that\\ntime.”\\n\\n\\n“They seem to have been of a most interesting character—dummy\\nbell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your permission, Miss\\nStoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment.”\\n\\n\\nDr. Grimesby Roylott’s chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter,\\nbut was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full of books,\\nmostly of a technical character, an armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden\\nchair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the principal\\nthings which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all\\nof them with the keenest interest.\\n\\n\\n“What’s in here?” he asked, tapping the safe.\\n\\n\\n“My stepfather’s business papers.”\\n\\n\\n“Oh! you have seen inside, then?”\\n\\n\\n“Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers.”\\n\\n\\n“There isn’t a cat in it, for example?”\\n\\n\\n“No. What a strange idea!”\\n\\n\\n“Well, look at this!” He took up a small saucer of milk which stood\\non the top of it.\\n\\n\\n“No; we don’t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a\\nbaboon.”\\n\\n\\n“Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer\\nof milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay. There is one\\npoint which I should wish to determine.” He squatted down in front of the\\nwooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention.\\n\\n\\n“Thank you. That is quite settled,” said he, rising and putting his\\nlens in his pocket. “Hullo! Here is something interesting!”\\n\\n\\nThe object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of\\nthe bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a\\nloop of whipcord.\\n\\n\\n“What do you make of that, Watson?”\\n\\n\\n“It’s a common enough lash. But I don’t know why it should be\\ntied.”\\n\\n\\n“That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it’s a wicked world,\\nand when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I think\\nthat I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your permission we shall\\nwalk out upon the lawn.”\\n\\n\\nI had never seen my friend’s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was\\nwhen we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked several\\ntimes up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking to break in\\nupon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie.\\n\\n\\n“It is very essential, Miss Stoner,” said he, “that you\\nshould absolutely follow my advice in every respect.”\\n\\n\\n“I shall most certainly do so.”\\n\\n\\n“The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend upon\\nyour compliance.”\\n\\n\\n“I assure you that I am in your hands.”\\n\\n\\n“In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your\\nroom.”\\n\\n\\nBoth Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.\\n\\n\\n“Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village\\ninn over there?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, that is the Crown.”\\n\\n\\n“Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?”\\n\\n\\n“Certainly.”\\n\\n\\n“You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when\\nyour stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the night, you\\nmust open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a\\nsignal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to\\nwant into the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of\\nthe repairs, you could manage there for one night.”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yes, easily.”\\n\\n\\n“The rest you will leave in our hands.”\\n\\n\\n“But what will you do?”\\n\\n\\n“We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the\\ncause of this noise which has disturbed you.”\\n\\n\\n“I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,”\\nsaid Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion’s sleeve.\\n\\n\\n“Perhaps I have.”\\n\\n\\n“Then, for pity’s sake, tell me what was the cause of my\\nsister’s death.”\\n\\n\\n“I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.”\\n\\n\\n“You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she\\ndied from some sudden fright.”\\n\\n\\n“No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more\\ntangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr. Roylott\\nreturned and saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and be brave, for\\nif you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon\\ndrive away the dangers that threaten you.”\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room\\nat the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from our window we could\\ncommand a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran\\nManor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form\\nlooming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some\\nslight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar\\nof the Doctor’s voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched\\nfists at him. The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light\\nspring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.\\n\\n\\n“Do you know, Watson,” said Holmes as we sat together in the\\ngathering darkness, “I have really some scruples as to taking you\\nto-night. There is a distinct element of danger.”\\n\\n\\n“Can I be of assistance?”\\n\\n\\n“Your presence might be invaluable.”\\n\\n\\n“Then I shall certainly come.”\\n\\n\\n“It is very kind of you.”\\n\\n\\n“You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than\\nwas visible to me.”\\n\\n\\n“No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that\\nyou saw all that I did.”\\n\\n\\n“I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that could\\nanswer I confess is more than I can imagine.”\\n\\n\\n“You saw the ventilator, too?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a\\nsmall opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could hardly pass\\nthrough.”\\n\\n\\n“I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke\\nMoran.”\\n\\n\\n“My dear Holmes!”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister\\ncould smell Dr. Roylott’s cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once\\nthat there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only be a\\nsmall one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner’s inquiry.\\nI deduced a ventilator.”\\n\\n\\n“But what harm can there be in that?”\\n\\n\\n“Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator is\\nmade, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does not that\\nstrike you?”\\n\\n\\n“I cannot as yet see any connection.”\\n\\n\\n“Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?”\\n\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n\\n“It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that\\nbefore?”\\n\\n\\n“I cannot say that I have.”\\n\\n\\n“The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same relative\\nposition to the ventilator and to the rope—or so we may call it, since it\\nwas clearly never meant for a bell-pull.”\\n\\n\\n“Holmes,” I cried, “I seem to see dimly what you are hinting\\nat. We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.”\\n\\n\\n“Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is the\\nfirst of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and Pritchard\\nwere among the heads of their profession. This man strikes even deeper, but I\\nthink, Watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have\\nhorrors enough before the night is over; for goodness’ sake let us have a\\nquiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more\\ncheerful.”\\n\\n\\nAbout nine o’clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all\\nwas dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly away, and\\nthen, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone out\\nright in front of us.\\n\\n\\n“That is our signal,” said Holmes, springing to his feet; “it\\ncomes from the middle window.”\\n\\n\\nAs we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we\\nwere going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that we\\nmight spend the night there. A moment later we were out on the dark road, a\\nchill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us\\nthrough the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.\\n\\n\\nThere was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches\\ngaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we reached the\\nlawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out from a\\nclump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted\\nchild, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly\\nacross the lawn into the darkness.\\n\\n\\n“My God!” I whispered; “did you see it?”\\n\\n\\nHolmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice upon my\\nwrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my\\near.\\n\\n\\n“It is a nice household,” he murmured. “That is the\\nbaboon.”\\n\\n\\nI had forgotten the strange pets which the Doctor affected. There was a\\ncheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment. I\\nconfess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes’\\nexample and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom. My\\ncompanion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and\\ncast his eyes round the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then\\ncreeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear\\nagain so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words:\\n\\n\\n“The least sound would be fatal to our plans.”\\n\\n\\nI nodded to show that I had heard.\\n\\n\\n“We must sit without light. He would see it through the\\nventilator.”\\n\\n\\nI nodded again.\\n\\n\\n“Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol\\nready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in\\nthat chair.”\\n\\n\\nI took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.\\n\\n\\nHolmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed beside\\nhim. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle. Then he turned\\ndown the lamp, and we were left in darkness.\\n\\n\\nHow shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not even\\nthe drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within\\na few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself.\\nThe shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute\\ndarkness.\\n\\n\\nFrom outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very\\nwindow a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at\\nliberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, which\\nboomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters!\\nTwelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for\\nwhatever might befall.\\n\\n\\nSuddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the\\nventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of\\nburning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern.\\nI heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though\\nthe smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears. Then\\nsuddenly another sound became audible—a very gentle, soothing sound, like\\nthat of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant\\nthat we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed\\nfuriously with his cane at the bell-pull.\\n\\n\\n“You see it, Watson?” he yelled. “You see it?”\\n\\n\\nBut I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low,\\nclear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it\\nimpossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely. I\\ncould, however, see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and\\nloathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when\\nsuddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to\\nwhich I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of\\npain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that\\naway down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised\\nthe sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazing\\nat Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died away into the\\nsilence from which it rose.\\n\\n\\n“What can it mean?” I gasped.\\n\\n\\n“It means that it is all over,” Holmes answered. “And\\nperhaps, after all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr.\\nRoylott’s room.”\\n\\n\\nWith a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor. Twice he\\nstruck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then he turned the\\nhandle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.\\n\\n\\nIt was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a dark-lantern\\nwith the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron\\nsafe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat\\nDr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles\\nprotruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers.\\nAcross his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed\\nduring the day. His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a\\ndreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a\\npeculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly\\nround his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.\\n\\n\\n“The band! the speckled band!” whispered Holmes.\\n\\n\\nI took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and\\nthere reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and\\npuffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\\n\\n\\n“It is a swamp adder!” cried Holmes; “the deadliest snake in\\nIndia. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth,\\nrecoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for\\nanother. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove\\nMiss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has\\nhappened.”\\n\\n\\nAs he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man’s lap, and\\nthrowing the noose round the reptile’s neck he drew it from its horrid\\nperch and, carrying it at arm’s length, threw it into the iron safe,\\nwhich he closed upon it.\\n\\n\\nSuch are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.\\nIt is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to\\ntoo great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl,\\nhow we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at\\nHarrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that\\nthe doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The\\nlittle which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as\\nwe travelled back next day.\\n\\n\\n“I had,” said he, “come to an entirely erroneous conclusion\\nwhich shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from\\ninsufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word\\n‘band,’ which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the\\nappearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match,\\nwere sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the\\nmerit that I instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear\\nto me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come\\neither from the window or the door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have\\nalready remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung\\ndown to the bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was\\nclamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was\\nthere as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed.\\nThe idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my\\nknowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India,\\nI felt that I was probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of\\npoison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just\\nsuch a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern\\ntraining. The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also,\\nfrom his point of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner,\\nindeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show\\nwhere the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of\\ncourse he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the\\nvictim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to\\nreturn to him when summoned. He would put it through this ventilator at the\\nhour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope\\nand land on the bed. It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might\\nescape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.\\n\\n\\n“I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An\\ninspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on\\nit, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the\\nventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord\\nwere enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic\\nclang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily\\nclosing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my\\nmind, you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof.\\nI heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly\\nlit the light and attacked it.”\\n\\n\\n“With the result of driving it through the ventilator.”\\n\\n\\n“And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the\\nother side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish\\ntemper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this way I am no doubt\\nindirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s death, and I cannot say\\nthat it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience.”\\n',\n",

       "  'body': '\\nWe were seated at\\nbreakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a telegram. It\\nwas from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:\\n\\n\\n“Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the\\nwest of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad if\\nyou will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the\\n11:15.”\\n\\n\\n“What do you say, dear?” said my wife, looking across at me.\\n“Will you go?”\\n\\n\\n“I really don’t know what to say. I have a fairly long list at\\npresent.”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a\\nlittle pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you are\\nalways so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes’ cases.”\\n\\n\\n“I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one\\nof them,” I answered. “But if I am to go, I must pack at once, for\\nI have only half an hour.”\\n\\n\\nMy experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of making\\nme a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and simple, so that in less\\nthan the time stated I was in a cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington\\nStation. Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt\\nfigure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and\\nclose-fitting cloth cap.\\n\\n\\n“It is really very good of you to come, Watson,” said he. “It\\nmakes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can\\nthoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed. If you\\nwill keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.”\\n\\n\\nWe had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which\\nHolmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read, with intervals\\nof note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading. Then he suddenly\\nrolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.\\n\\n\\n“Have you heard anything of the case?” he asked.\\n\\n\\n“Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.”\\n\\n\\n“The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been\\nlooking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars. It\\nseems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so\\nextremely difficult.”\\n\\n\\n“That sounds a little paradoxical.”\\n\\n\\n“But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue. The\\nmore featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring\\nit home. In this case, however, they have established a very serious case\\nagainst the son of the murdered man.”\\n\\n\\n“It is a murder, then?”\\n\\n\\n“Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until\\nI have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will explain the state\\nof things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few\\nwords.\\n\\n\\n“Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in\\nHerefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner,\\nwho made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country.\\nOne of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles\\nMcCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the\\ncolonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they\\nshould do so as near each other as possible. Turner was apparently the richer\\nman, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of\\nperfect equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad\\nof eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of\\nthem had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the\\nneighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though both the\\nMcCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of\\nthe neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants—a man and a girl. Turner\\nhad a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. That is as much as\\nI have been able to gather about the families. Now for the facts.\\n\\n\\n“On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at\\nHatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool,\\nwhich is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down\\nthe Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his serving-man in the morning at\\nRoss, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of\\nimportance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came back alive.\\n\\n\\n“From Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile,\\nand two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old woman,\\nwhose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder, a game-keeper\\nin the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was\\nwalking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr.\\nMcCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the same way with\\na gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the father was actually in\\nsight at the time, and the son was following him. He thought no more of the\\nmatter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.\\n\\n\\n“The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the\\ngame-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round,\\nwith just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl of fourteen,\\nPatience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley\\nestate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She states that while she was\\nthere she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy\\nand his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. She heard\\nMr. McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the\\nlatter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by\\ntheir violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that\\nshe had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was\\nafraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said the words when young\\nMr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father\\ndead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much\\nexcited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were\\nobserved to be stained with fresh blood. On following him they found the dead\\nbody stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in\\nby repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as\\nmight very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son’s gun,\\nwhich was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these\\ncircumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of\\n‘wilful murder’ having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he\\nwas on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the\\ncase to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out\\nbefore the coroner and the police-court.”\\n\\n\\n“I could hardly imagine a more damning case,” I remarked. “If\\never circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.”\\n\\n\\n“Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,” answered Holmes\\nthoughtfully. “It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if\\nyou shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an\\nequally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It must be\\nconfessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young\\nman, and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several\\npeople in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the daughter\\nof the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who have\\nretained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection with the Study in\\nScarlet, to work out the case in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled,\\nhas referred the case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are\\nflying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their\\nbreakfasts at home.”\\n\\n\\n“I am afraid,” said I, “that the facts are so obvious that\\nyou will find little credit to be gained out of this case.”\\n\\n\\n“There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,” he\\nanswered, laughing. “Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other\\nobvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know\\nme too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm\\nor destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or\\neven of understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly\\nperceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and yet I\\nquestion whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as\\nthat.”\\n\\n\\n“How on earth—”\\n\\n\\n“My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which\\ncharacterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you shave by the\\nsunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther\\nback on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the\\nangle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated\\nthan the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in\\nan equal light and being satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a\\ntrivial example of observation and inference. Therein lies my mÃ©tier,\\nand it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation\\nwhich lies before us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out\\nin the inquest, and which are worth considering.”\\n\\n\\n“What are they?”\\n\\n\\n“It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the\\nreturn to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing him that\\nhe was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that\\nit was no more than his deserts. This observation of his had the natural effect\\nof removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the\\ncoroner’s jury.”\\n\\n\\n“It was a confession,” I ejaculated.\\n\\n\\n“No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.”\\n\\n\\n“Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a\\nmost suspicious remark.”\\n\\n\\n“On the contrary,” said Holmes, “it is the brightest rift\\nwhich I can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he\\ncould not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances\\nwere very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or\\nfeigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious,\\nbecause such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances,\\nand yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His frank\\nacceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a\\nman of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark about his\\ndeserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the\\ndead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day\\nso far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even,\\naccording to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand\\nas if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in\\nhis remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a\\nguilty one.”\\n\\n\\nI shook my head. “Many men have been hanged on far slighter\\nevidence,” I remarked.\\n\\n\\n“So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.”\\n\\n\\n“What is the young man’s own account of the matter?”\\n\\n\\n“It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there\\nare one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find it here, and\\nmay read it for yourself.”\\n\\n\\nHe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, and\\nhaving turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the\\nunfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred. I\\nsettled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully.\\nIt ran in this way:\\n\\n\\n“Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and\\ngave evidence as follows: ‘I had been away from home for three days at\\nBristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd.\\nMy father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was informed by\\nthe maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly\\nafter my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of\\nmy window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was not\\naware in which direction he was going. I then took my gun and strolled out in\\nthe direction of the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit\\nwarren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the\\ngame-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinking\\nthat I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in front of me. When\\nabout a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of “Cooee!” which\\nwas a usual signal between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and\\nfound him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me\\nand asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A conversation ensued which\\nled to high words and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very\\nviolent temper. Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him\\nand returned towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards,\\nhowever, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back\\nagain. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly\\ninjured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost instantly\\nexpired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to Mr.\\nTurner’s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for\\nassistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how\\nhe came by his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and\\nforbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no active enemies. I\\nknow nothing further of the matter.’\\n\\n\\n“The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?\\n\\n\\n“Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to\\na rat.\\n\\n\\n“The Coroner: What did you understand by that?\\n\\n\\n“Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was delirious.\\n\\n\\n“The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had this\\nfinal quarrel?\\n\\n\\n“Witness: I should prefer not to answer.\\n\\n\\n“The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.\\n\\n\\n“Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you\\nthat it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.\\n\\n\\n“The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to\\nyou that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any\\nfuture proceedings which may arise.\\n\\n\\n“Witness: I must still refuse.\\n\\n\\n“The Coroner: I understand that the cry of ‘Cooee’ was a\\ncommon signal between you and your father?\\n\\n\\n“Witness: It was.\\n\\n\\n“The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and\\nbefore he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?\\n\\n\\n“Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.\\n\\n\\n“A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you\\nreturned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?\\n\\n\\n“Witness: Nothing definite.\\n\\n\\n“The Coroner: What do you mean?\\n\\n\\n“Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open,\\nthat I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague\\nimpression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of\\nme. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a\\nplaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was\\ngone.\\n\\n\\n“‘Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for\\nhelp?’\\n\\n\\n“‘Yes, it was gone.’\\n\\n\\n“  ‘You cannot say what it was?’\\n\\n\\n“‘No, I had a feeling something was there.’\\n\\n\\n“‘How far from the body?’\\n\\n\\n“‘A dozen yards or so.’\\n\\n\\n“‘And how far from the edge of the wood?’\\n\\n\\n“‘About the same.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen\\nyards of it?’\\n\\n\\n“‘Yes, but with my back towards it.’\\n\\n\\n“This concluded the examination of the witness.”\\n\\n\\n“I see,” said I as I glanced down the column, “that the\\ncoroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He\\ncalls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having\\nsignalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his\\nconversation with his father, and his singular account of his father’s\\ndying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son.”\\n\\n\\nHolmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned\\nseat. “Both you and the coroner have been at some pains,” said he,\\n“to single out the very strongest points in the young man’s favour.\\nDon’t you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much\\nimagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause of\\nquarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved\\nfrom his own inner consciousness anything so outrÃ© as a dying reference\\nto a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach\\nthis case from the point of view that what this young man says is true, and we\\nshall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket\\nPetrarch, and not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the\\nscene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in\\ntwenty minutes.”\\n\\n\\nIt was nearly four o’clock when we at last, after passing through the\\nbeautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at\\nthe pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-like man, furtive and\\nsly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown\\ndustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic\\nsurroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard.\\nWith him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged\\nfor us.\\n\\n\\n“I have ordered a carriage,” said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of\\ntea. “I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until\\nyou had been on the scene of the crime.”\\n\\n\\n“It was very nice and complimentary of you,” Holmes answered.\\n“It is entirely a question of barometric pressure.”\\n\\n\\nLestrade looked startled. “I do not quite follow,” he said.\\n\\n\\n“How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the\\nsky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is\\nvery much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do not think that\\nit is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.”\\n\\n\\nLestrade laughed indulgently. “You have, no doubt, already formed your\\nconclusions from the newspapers,” he said. “The case is as plain as\\na pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still, of\\ncourse, one can’t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. She\\nhas heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her\\nthat there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done. Why,\\nbless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.”\\n\\n\\nHe had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely\\nyoung women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes shining, her lips\\nparted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost\\nin her overpowering excitement and concern.\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!” she cried, glancing from one to the\\nother of us, and finally, with a woman’s quick intuition, fastening upon\\nmy companion, “I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to\\ntell you so. I know that James didn’t do it. I know it, and I want you to\\nstart upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point.\\nWe have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults\\nas no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge\\nis absurd to anyone who really knows him.”\\n\\n\\n“I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,” said Sherlock Holmes.\\n“You may rely upon my doing all that I can.”\\n\\n\\n“But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do you\\nnot see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is\\ninnocent?”\\n\\n\\n“I think that it is very probable.”\\n\\n\\n“There, now!” she cried, throwing back her head and looking\\ndefiantly at Lestrade. “You hear! He gives me hopes.”\\n\\n\\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. “I am afraid that my colleague has been\\na little quick in forming his conclusions,” he said.\\n\\n\\n“But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And\\nabout his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would not\\nspeak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it.”\\n\\n\\n“In what way?” asked Holmes.\\n\\n\\n“It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many\\ndisagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a\\nmarriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as brother and\\nsister; but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet,\\nand—and—well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that\\nyet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them.”\\n\\n\\n“And your father?” asked Holmes. “Was he in favour of such a\\nunion?”\\n\\n\\n“No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of\\nit.” A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of\\nhis keen, questioning glances at her.\\n\\n\\n“Thank you for this information,” said he. “May I see your\\nfather if I call to-morrow?”\\n\\n\\n“I am afraid the doctor won’t allow it.”\\n\\n\\n“The doctor?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years\\nback, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed, and Dr.\\nWillows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered. Mr.\\nMcCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in\\nVictoria.”\\n\\n\\n“Ha! In Victoria! That is important.”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, at the mines.”\\n\\n\\n“Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made his\\nmoney.”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, certainly.”\\n\\n\\n“Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to\\nme.”\\n\\n\\n“You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go to\\nthe prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know him\\nto be innocent.”\\n\\n\\n“I will, Miss Turner.”\\n\\n\\n“I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave\\nhim. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.” She hurried from\\nthe room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her\\ncarriage rattle off down the street.\\n\\n\\n“I am ashamed of you, Holmes,” said Lestrade with dignity after a\\nfew minutes’ silence. “Why should you raise up hopes which you are\\nbound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.”\\n\\n\\n“I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,” said\\nHolmes. “Have you an order to see him in prison?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, but only for you and me.”\\n\\n\\n“Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still\\ntime to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?”\\n\\n\\n“Ample.”\\n\\n\\n“Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I\\nshall only be away a couple of hours.”\\n\\n\\nI walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets\\nof the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa\\nand tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the\\nstory was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we\\nwere groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the action to\\nthe fact, that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely\\nto a consideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young\\nman’s story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what\\nabsolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between\\nthe time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his\\nscreams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and deadly. What\\ncould it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my\\nmedical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper,\\nwhich contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon’s\\ndeposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and\\nthe left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a\\nblunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have\\nbeen struck from behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as\\nwhen seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go\\nfor very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow\\nfell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes’ attention to it.\\nThen there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It\\ncould not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become\\ndelirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his\\nfate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible\\nexplanation. And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If\\nthat were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress,\\npresumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to\\nreturn and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his\\nback turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and\\nimprobabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade’s\\nopinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes’ insight that I\\ncould not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his\\nconviction of young McCarthy’s innocence.\\n\\n\\nIt was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for Lestrade\\nwas staying in lodgings in the town.\\n\\n\\n“The glass still keeps very high,” he remarked as he sat down.\\n“It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go\\nover the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and\\nkeenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by\\na long journey. I have seen young McCarthy.”\\n\\n\\n“And what did you learn from him?”\\n\\n\\n“Nothing.”\\n\\n\\n“Could he throw no light?”\\n\\n\\n“None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had\\ndone it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as\\npuzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to\\nlook at and, I should think, sound at heart.”\\n\\n\\n“I cannot admire his taste,” I remarked, “if it is indeed a\\nfact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this\\nMiss Turner.”\\n\\n\\n“Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly, insanely,\\nin love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before he\\nreally knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school, what\\ndoes the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry\\nher at a registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can\\nimagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he\\nwould give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible.\\nIt was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air\\nwhen his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss\\nTurner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and his\\nfather, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him over\\nutterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent\\nthe last three days in Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark\\nthat point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however, for the\\nbarmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be\\nhanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has\\na husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie\\nbetween them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all\\nthat he has suffered.”\\n\\n\\n“But if he is innocent, who has done it?”\\n\\n\\n“Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points.\\nOne is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and\\nthat the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did\\nnot know when he would return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to\\ncry ‘Cooee!’ before he knew that his son had returned. Those are\\nthe crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk about\\nGeorge Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters until\\nto-morrow.”\\n\\n\\nThere was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and\\ncloudless. At nine o’clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and\\nwe set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.\\n\\n\\n“There is serious news this morning,” Lestrade observed. “It\\nis said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired\\nof.”\\n\\n\\n“An elderly man, I presume?” said Holmes.\\n\\n\\n“About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad,\\nand he has been in failing health for some time. This business has had a very\\nbad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy’s, and, I may add,\\na great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm\\nrent free.”\\n\\n\\n“Indeed! That is interesting,” said Holmes.\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about here\\nspeaks of his kindness to him.”\\n\\n\\n“Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy,\\nwho appears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such\\nobligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son to Turner’s\\ndaughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very\\ncocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would\\nfollow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself was averse to\\nthe idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not deduce something from\\nthat?”\\n\\n\\n“We have got to the deductions and the inferences,” said Lestrade,\\nwinking at me. “I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without\\nflying away after theories and fancies.”\\n\\n\\n“You are right,” said Holmes demurely; “you do find it very\\nhard to tackle the facts.”\\n\\n\\n“Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to\\nget hold of,” replied Lestrade with some warmth.\\n\\n\\n“And that is—”\\n\\n\\n“That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all\\ntheories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.”\\n\\n\\n“Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,” said Holmes,\\nlaughing. “But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon\\nthe left.”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, that is it.” It was a widespread, comfortable-looking\\nbuilding, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon\\nthe grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a\\nstricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We\\ncalled at the door, when the maid, at Holmes’ request, showed us the\\nboots which her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the\\nson’s, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured these\\nvery carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to be led\\nto the court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which led to\\nBoscombe Pool.\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this. Men\\nwho had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker Street would have\\nfailed to recognise him. His face flushed and darkened. His brows were drawn\\ninto two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a\\nsteely glitter. His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips\\ncompressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His\\nnostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind\\nwas so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or\\nremark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick,\\nimpatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track\\nwhich ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool.\\nIt was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of\\nmany feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on\\neither side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he\\nmade quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him,\\nthe detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the\\ninterest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was\\ndirected towards a definite end.\\n\\n\\nThe Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards\\nacross, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private\\npark of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods which lined it upon the farther\\nside we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich\\nlandowner’s dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew\\nvery thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across\\nbetween the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade\\nshowed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so\\nmoist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left\\nby the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face\\nand peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled\\ngrass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon\\nmy companion.\\n\\n\\n“What did you go into the pool for?” he asked.\\n\\n\\n“I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or\\nother trace. But how on earth—”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward\\ntwist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among\\nthe reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they\\ncame like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party\\nwith the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight\\nfeet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same\\nfeet.” He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a\\nbetter view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. “These\\nare young McCarthy’s feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly,\\nso that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears\\nout his story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the\\nfather’s feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the\\nbutt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we\\nhere? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go,\\nthey come again—of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they come\\nfrom?” He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track\\nuntil we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great\\nbeech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way to the\\nfarther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of\\nsatisfaction. For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and\\ndried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and\\nexamining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as\\nfar as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also\\nhe carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the wood\\nuntil he came to the high road, where all traces were lost.\\n\\n\\n“It has been a case of considerable interest,” he remarked,\\nreturning to his natural manner. “I fancy that this grey house on the\\nright must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran,\\nand perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our\\nluncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.”\\n\\n\\nIt was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into Ross,\\nHolmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood.\\n\\n\\n“This may interest you, Lestrade,” he remarked, holding it out.\\n“The murder was done with it.”\\n\\n\\n“I see no marks.”\\n\\n\\n“There are none.”\\n\\n\\n“How do you know, then?”\\n\\n\\n“The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days. There\\nwas no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds with the\\ninjuries. There is no sign of any other weapon.”\\n\\n\\n“And the murderer?”\\n\\n\\n“Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled\\nshooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and\\ncarries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are several other indications,\\nbut these may be enough to aid us in our search.”\\n\\n\\nLestrade laughed. “I am afraid that I am still a sceptic,” he said.\\n“Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed\\nBritish jury.”\\n\\n\\n“Nous verrons,” answered Holmes calmly. “You work your\\nown method, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall\\nprobably return to London by the evening train.”\\n\\n\\n“And leave your case unfinished?”\\n\\n\\n“No, finished.”\\n\\n\\n“But the mystery?”\\n\\n\\n“It is solved.”\\n\\n\\n“Who was the criminal, then?”\\n\\n\\n“The gentleman I describe.”\\n\\n\\n“But who is he?”\\n\\n\\n“Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a\\npopulous neighbourhood.”\\n\\n\\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. “I am a practical man,” he said,\\n“and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a\\nleft-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the laughing-stock of\\nScotland Yard.”\\n\\n\\n“All right,” said Holmes quietly. “I have given you the\\nchance. Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I\\nleave.”\\n\\n\\nHaving left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we found lunch\\nupon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained\\nexpression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.\\n\\n\\n“Look here, Watson,” he said when the cloth was cleared “just\\nsit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don’t\\nknow quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar and let me\\nexpound.”\\n\\n\\n “Pray do so.”\\n\\n\\n“Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young\\nMcCarthy’s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they\\nimpressed me in his favour and you against him. One was the fact that his\\nfather should, according to his account, cry ‘Cooee!’ before seeing\\nhim. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled several\\nwords, you understand, but that was all that caught the son’s ear. Now\\nfrom this double point our research must commence, and we will begin it by\\npresuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.”\\n\\n\\n“What of this ‘Cooee!’ then?”\\n\\n\\n“Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as\\nfar as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within earshot.\\nThe ‘Cooee!’ was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was\\nthat he had the appointment with. But ‘Cooee’ is a distinctly\\nAustralian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a strong\\npresumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool\\nwas someone who had been in Australia.”\\n\\n\\n“What of the rat, then?”\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the\\ntable. “This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,” he said. “I\\nwired to Bristol for it last night.” He put his hand over part of the\\nmap. “What do you read?”\\n\\n\\n“ARAT,” I read.\\n\\n\\n“And now?” He raised his hand.\\n\\n\\n“BALLARAT.”\\n\\n\\n“Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only\\ncaught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his murderer.\\nSo and so, of Ballarat.”\\n\\n\\n“It is wonderful!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n\\n“It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down\\nconsiderably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point which,\\ngranting the son’s statement to be correct, was a certainty. We have come\\nnow out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Australian from\\nBallarat with a grey cloak.”\\n\\n\\n“Certainly.”\\n\\n\\n“And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be\\napproached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly\\nwander.”\\n\\n\\n“Quite so.”\\n\\n\\n“Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I\\ngained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as to the\\npersonality of the criminal.”\\n\\n\\n“But how did you gain them?”\\n\\n\\n“You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of\\ntrifles.”\\n\\n\\n“His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his\\nstride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces.”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, they were peculiar boots.”\\n\\n\\n“But his lameness?”\\n\\n\\n“The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left.\\nHe put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped—he was lame.”\\n\\n\\n“But his left-handedness.”\\n\\n\\n“You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the\\nsurgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately behind, and yet\\nwas upon the left side. Now, how can that be unless it were by a left-handed\\nman? He had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and\\nson. He had even smoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special\\nknowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have,\\nas you know, devoted some attention to this, and written a little monograph on\\nthe ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco.\\nHaving found the ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the\\nmoss where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which are\\nrolled in Rotterdam.”\\n\\n\\n“And the cigar-holder?”\\n\\n\\n“I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used a\\nholder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not a clean\\none, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.”\\n\\n\\n“Holmes,” I said, “you have drawn a net round this man from\\nwhich he cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as\\nif you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction in which all\\nthis points. The culprit is—”\\n\\n\\n“Mr. John Turner,” cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our\\nsitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.\\n\\n\\nThe man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow, limping step\\nand bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude, and yet his hard,\\ndeep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed that he was\\npossessed of unusual strength of body and of character. His tangled beard,\\ngrizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of\\ndignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while\\nhis lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It\\nwas clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic\\ndisease.\\n\\n\\n“Pray sit down on the sofa,” said Holmes gently. “You had my\\nnote?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see me\\nhere to avoid scandal.”\\n\\n\\n“I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.”\\n\\n\\n“And why did you wish to see me?” He looked across at my companion\\nwith despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words.\\n“It is so. I know all about McCarthy.”\\n\\n\\nThe old man sank his face in his hands. “God help me!” he cried.\\n“But I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word\\nthat I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.”\\n\\n\\n“I am glad to hear you say so,” said Holmes gravely.\\n\\n\\n“I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would break\\nher heart—it will break her heart when she hears that I am\\narrested.”\\n\\n\\n“It may not come to that,” said Holmes.\\n\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n\\n“I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who\\nrequired my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young McCarthy\\nmust be got off, however.”\\n\\n\\n“I am a dying man,” said old Turner. “I have had diabetes for\\nyears. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I\\nwould rather die under my own roof than in a gaol.”\\n\\n\\nHolmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of\\npaper before him. “Just tell us the truth,” he said. “I shall\\njot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it. Then I\\ncould produce your confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy. I\\npromise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed.”\\n\\n\\n“It’s as well,” said the old man; “it’s a\\nquestion whether I shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I\\nshould wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to\\nyou; it has been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.\\n\\n\\n“You didn’t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate.\\nI tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he. His grip\\nhas been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life. I’ll\\ntell you first how I came to be in his power.\\n\\n\\n“It was in the early ’60’s at the diggings. I was a young\\nchap then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got\\namong bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to the\\nbush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber.\\nThere were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station\\nfrom time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings. Black\\nJack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party is still remembered\\nin the colony as the Ballarat Gang.\\n\\n\\n“One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay\\nin wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us, so it\\nwas a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley.\\nThree of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol\\nto the head of the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the\\nLord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his wicked little\\neyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature. We got away with\\nthe gold, became wealthy men, and made our way over to England without being\\nsuspected. There I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a\\nquiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in the\\nmarket, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to make up for the\\nway in which I had earned it. I married, too, and though my wife died young she\\nleft me my dear little Alice. Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed\\nto lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I\\nturned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was going\\nwell when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.\\n\\n\\n“I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent\\nStreet with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.\\n\\n\\n“‘Here we are, Jack,’ says he, touching me on the arm;\\n‘we’ll be as good as a family to you. There’s two of us, me\\nand my son, and you can have the keeping of us. If you\\ndon’t—it’s a fine, law-abiding country is England, and\\nthere’s always a policeman within hail.’\\n\\n\\n“Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them off,\\nand there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since. There was no\\nrest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his\\ncunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon\\nsaw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he\\nwanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without question, land,\\nmoney, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I could not give. He asked\\nfor Alice.\\n\\n\\n“His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known\\nto be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step\\ninto the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not have his cursed\\nstock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was\\nin him, and that was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to\\ndo his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it\\nover.\\n\\n\\n“When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a\\ncigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I listened to\\nhis talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost. He was\\nurging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might\\nthink as if she were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that\\nI and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this.\\nCould I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though\\nclear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed.\\nBut my memory and my girl! Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul\\ntongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned, I\\nhave led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl should be\\nentangled in the same meshes which held me was more than I could suffer. I\\nstruck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and\\nvenomous beast. His cry brought back his son; but I had gained the cover of the\\nwood, though I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in\\nmy flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that occurred.”\\n\\n\\n“Well, it is not for me to judge you,” said Holmes as the old man\\nsigned the statement which had been drawn out. “I pray that we may never\\nbe exposed to such a temptation.”\\n\\n\\n“I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?”\\n\\n\\n“In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will\\nsoon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes. I will\\nkeep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I shall be forced to use it.\\nIf not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be\\nalive or dead, shall be safe with us.”\\n\\n\\n“Farewell, then,” said the old man solemnly. “Your own\\ndeathbeds, when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace\\nwhich you have given to mine.” Tottering and shaking in all his giant\\nframe, he stumbled slowly from the room.\\n\\n\\n“God help us!” said Holmes after a long silence. “Why does\\nfate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as\\nthis that I do not think of Baxter’s words, and say, ‘There, but\\nfor the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.’”\\n\\n\\nJames McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number of\\nobjections which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the defending\\ncounsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our interview, but he is now\\ndead; and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live\\nhappily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past.\\n',\n",

       "  'body': '\\n“Holmes,”\\nsaid I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down the street,\\n“here is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that his relatives\\nshould allow him to come out alone.”\\n\\n\\nMy friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets\\nof his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a bright, crisp February\\nmorning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground,\\nshimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had\\nbeen ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and\\non the heaped-up edges of the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell.\\nThe grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously\\nslippery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the\\ndirection of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single\\ngentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.\\n\\n\\nHe was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive,\\nstrongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed in a sombre yet\\nrich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut\\npearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of\\nhis dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little\\nsprings, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon\\nhis legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and\\nwrithed his face into the most extraordinary contortions.\\n\\n\\n“What on earth can be the matter with him?” I asked. “He is\\nlooking up at the numbers of the houses.”\\n\\n\\n“I believe that he is coming here,” said Holmes, rubbing his hands.\\n\\n\\n“Here?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think\\nthat I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?” As he spoke, the\\nman, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the\\nwhole house resounded with the clanging.\\n\\n\\nA few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating, but\\nwith so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were\\nturned in an instant to horror and pity. For a while he could not get his words\\nout, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven\\nto the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he\\nbeat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and\\ntore him away to the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into\\nthe easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in\\nthe easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.\\n\\n\\n“You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?” said he.\\n“You are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered\\nyourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which\\nyou may submit to me.”\\n\\n\\nThe man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his\\nemotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight, and\\nturned his face towards us.\\n\\n\\n“No doubt you think me mad?” said he.\\n\\n\\n“I see that you have had some great trouble,” responded Holmes.\\n\\n\\n“God knows I have!—a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason,\\nso sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced, although I\\nam a man whose character has never yet borne a stain. Private affliction also\\nis the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful a\\nform, have been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The\\nvery noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this\\nhorrible affair.”\\n\\n\\n“Pray compose yourself, sir,” said Holmes, “and let me have a\\nclear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you.”\\n\\n\\n“My name,” answered our visitor, “is probably familiar to\\nyour ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder &\\nStevenson, of Threadneedle Street.”\\n\\n\\nThe name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the\\nsecond largest private banking concern in the City of London. What could have\\nhappened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most\\npitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced\\nhimself to tell his story.\\n\\n\\n“I feel that time is of value,” said he; “that is why I\\nhastened here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your\\nco-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried from there\\non foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is why I was so out of\\nbreath, for I am a man who takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I\\nwill put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.\\n\\n\\n“It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking\\nbusiness as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments\\nfor our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our\\ndepositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape\\nof loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this\\ndirection during the last few years, and there are many noble families to whom\\nwe have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, or\\nplate.\\n\\n\\n“Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was\\nbrought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it\\nwas that of none other than—well, perhaps even to you I had better say no\\nmore than that it was a name which is a household word all over the\\nearth—one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I was\\noverwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he\\nplunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly\\nthrough a disagreeable task.\\n\\n\\n“‘Mr. Holder,’ said he, ‘I have been informed\\nthat you are in the habit of advancing money.’\\n\\n\\n“‘The firm does so when the security is good.’ I\\nanswered.\\n\\n\\n“‘It is absolutely essential to me,’ said he, ‘that I\\nshould have Â£ 50,000 at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten\\ntimes over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business\\nand to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily\\nunderstand that it is unwise to place one’s self under obligations.’\\n\\n\\n“‘For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?’ I\\nasked.\\n\\n\\n“‘Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then\\nmost certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it\\nright to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should be paid\\nat once.’\\n\\n\\n“‘I should be happy to advance it without further parley from\\nmy own private purse,’ said I, ‘were it not that the strain would\\nbe rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the\\nname of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that, even in\\nyour case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.’\\n\\n\\n“‘I should much prefer to have it so,’ said he, raising\\nup a square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. ‘You\\nhave doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?’\\n\\n\\n“‘One of the most precious public possessions of the\\nempire,’ said I.\\n\\n\\n“‘Precisely.’ He opened the case, and there, imbedded\\nin soft, flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he\\nhad named. ‘There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,’ said he,\\n‘and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate\\nwould put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am\\nprepared to leave it with you as my security.’\\n\\n\\n“I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity\\nfrom it to my illustrious client.\\n\\n\\n“‘You doubt its value?’ he asked.\\n\\n\\n“‘Not at all. I only doubt—’\\n\\n\\n“‘The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at\\nrest about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain\\nthat I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter of form.\\nIs the security sufficient?’\\n\\n\\n“‘Ample.’\\n\\n\\n“‘You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong\\nproof of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard\\nof you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip\\nupon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with every possible\\nprecaution because I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused\\nif any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as serious as\\nits complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to match these, and it\\nwould be impossible to replace them. I leave it with you, however, with every\\nconfidence, and I shall call for it in person on Monday morning.’\\n\\n\\n“Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but, calling\\nfor my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty Â£ 1000 notes. When I was alone\\nonce more, however, with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me,\\nI could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which\\nit entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it was a national\\npossession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to\\nit. I already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it. However, it\\nwas too late to alter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and\\nturned once more to my work.\\n\\n\\n“When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so\\nprecious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers’ safes had been forced\\nbefore now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible would be the\\nposition in which I should find myself! I determined, therefore, that for the\\nnext few days I would always carry the case backward and forward with me, so\\nthat it might never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a\\ncab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did\\nnot breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of\\nmy dressing-room.\\n\\n\\n“And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to\\nthoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of the\\nhouse, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants who have\\nbeen with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above\\nsuspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my\\nservice a few months. She came with an excellent character, however, and has\\nalways given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has attracted\\nadmirers who have occasionally hung about the place. That is the only drawback\\nwhich we have found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in\\nevery way.\\n\\n\\n“So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will not\\ntake me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son, Arthur. He\\nhas been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes—a grievous disappointment. I\\nhave no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled\\nhim. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to\\nlove. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face. I\\nhave never denied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better for both of us\\nhad I been sterner, but I meant it for the best.\\n\\n\\n“It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business,\\nbut he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the\\ntruth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money. When he\\nwas young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having\\ncharming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses\\nand expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money\\non the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give\\nhim an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He\\ntried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was\\nkeeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was\\nenough to draw him back again.\\n\\n\\n“And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell\\nshould gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my\\nhouse, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of\\nhis manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one\\nwho had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of\\ngreat personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far away from the\\nglamour of his presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look\\nwhich I have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted.\\nSo I think, and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman’s quick\\ninsight into character.\\n\\n\\n“And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when my\\nbrother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her, and\\nhave looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is a sunbeam in my\\nhouse—sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet\\nas tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do\\nnot know what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone\\nagainst my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her\\ndevotedly, but each time she has refused him. I think that if anyone could have\\ndrawn him into the right path it would have been she, and that his marriage\\nmight have changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late—forever\\ntoo late!\\n\\n\\n“Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I shall\\ncontinue with my miserable story.\\n\\n\\n“When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after dinner,\\nI told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious treasure which we had\\nunder our roof, suppressing only the name of my client. Lucy Parr, who had\\nbrought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that\\nthe door was closed. Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the\\nfamous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.\\n\\n\\n“‘Where have you put it?’ asked Arthur.\\n\\n\\n“‘In my own bureau.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Well, I hope to goodness the house won’t be burgled\\nduring the night.’ said he.\\n\\n\\n“‘It is locked up,’ I answered.\\n\\n\\n“‘Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a\\nyoungster I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.’\\n\\n\\n“He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what he\\nsaid. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very grave face.\\n\\n\\n“‘Look here, dad,’ said he with his eyes cast down,\\n‘can you let me have Â£ 200?’\\n\\n\\n“‘No, I cannot!’ I answered sharply. ‘I have been\\nfar too generous with you in money matters.’\\n\\n\\n“‘You have been very kind,’ said he, ‘but I must\\nhave this money, or else I can never show my face inside the club again.’\\n\\n\\n“‘And a very good thing, too!’ I cried.\\n\\n\\n“‘Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured\\nman,’ said he. ‘I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the\\nmoney in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try other\\nmeans.’\\n\\n\\n“I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month.\\n‘You shall not have a farthing from me,’ I cried, on which he bowed\\nand left the room without another word.\\n\\n\\n“When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was\\nsafe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see that all\\nwas secure—a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I thought it\\nwell to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself\\nat the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached.\\n\\n\\n“‘Tell me, dad,’ said she, looking, I thought, a little\\ndisturbed, ‘did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?’\\n\\n\\n“‘Certainly not.’\\n\\n\\n“‘She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that\\nshe has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that it is\\nhardly safe and should be stopped.’\\n\\n\\n“‘You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you\\nprefer it. Are you sure that everything is fastened?’\\n\\n\\n“‘Quite sure, dad.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Then, good-night.’ I kissed her and went up to my\\nbedroom again, where I was soon asleep.\\n\\n\\n“I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have any\\nbearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any point which\\nI do not make clear.”\\n\\n\\n“On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.”\\n\\n\\n“I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be\\nparticularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind\\ntended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in the morning,\\nthen, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had ceased ere I was wide\\nawake, but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently\\nclosed somewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my horror,\\nthere was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room. I\\nslipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of\\nmy dressing-room door.\\n\\n\\n“‘Arthur!’ I screamed, ‘you villain! you thief!\\nHow dare you touch that coronet?’\\n\\n\\n“The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed only\\nin his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding the coronet\\nin his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with all his\\nstrength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I\\nsnatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with three of the\\nberyls in it, was missing.\\n\\n\\n“‘You blackguard!’ I shouted, beside myself with rage.\\n‘You have destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the\\njewels which you have stolen?’\\n\\n\\n“‘Stolen!’ he cried.\\n\\n\\n“‘Yes, thief!’ I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.\\n\\n\\n“‘There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,’\\nsaid he.\\n\\n\\n“‘There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must\\nI call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off\\nanother piece?’\\n\\n\\n“‘You have called me names enough,’ said he, ‘I\\nwill not stand it any longer. I shall not say another word about this business,\\nsince you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and\\nmake my own way in the world.’\\n\\n\\n“‘You shall leave it in the hands of the police!’ I\\ncried half-mad with grief and rage. ‘I shall have this matter probed to\\nthe bottom.’\\n\\n\\n“‘You shall learn nothing from me,’ said he with a\\npassion such as I should not have thought was in his nature. ‘If you\\nchoose to call the police, let the police find what they can.’\\n\\n\\n“By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in my\\nanger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of the\\ncoronet and of Arthur’s face, she read the whole story and, with a\\nscream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the housemaid for the police\\nand put the investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a\\nconstable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms\\nfolded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft. I\\nanswered that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become a public\\none, since the ruined coronet was national property. I was determined that the\\nlaw should have its way in everything.\\n\\n\\n“‘At least,’ said he, ‘you will not have me\\narrested at once. It would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might\\nleave the house for five minutes.’\\n\\n\\n“‘That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what\\nyou have stolen,’ said I. And then, realising the dreadful position in\\nwhich I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that\\nof one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened to raise\\na scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would\\nbut tell me what he had done with the three missing stones.\\n\\n\\n“‘You may as well face the matter,’ said I; ‘you\\nhave been caught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more\\nheinous. If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us\\nwhere the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.’\\n\\n\\n“‘Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,’ he\\nanswered, turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for\\nany words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in\\nthe inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only of\\nhis person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could\\npossibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor\\nwould the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats.\\nThis morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after going through all the\\npolice formalities, have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill\\nin unravelling the matter. The police have openly confessed that they can at\\npresent make nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think\\nnecessary. I have already offered a reward of Â£ 1000. My God, what shall I do!\\nI have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I\\ndo!”\\n\\n\\nHe put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro, droning\\nto himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted and his\\neyes fixed upon the fire.\\n\\n\\n“Do you receive much company?” he asked.\\n\\n\\n“None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of\\nArthur’s. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one else,\\nI think.”\\n\\n\\n“Do you go out much in society?”\\n\\n\\n“Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for\\nit.”\\n\\n\\n“That is unusual in a young girl.”\\n\\n\\n“She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is\\nfour-and-twenty.”\\n\\n\\n“This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her\\nalso.”\\n\\n\\n“Terrible! She is even more affected than I.”\\n\\n\\n“You have neither of you any doubt as to your son’s guilt?”\\n\\n\\n“How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his\\nhands.”\\n\\n\\n“I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the\\ncoronet at all injured?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, it was twisted.”\\n\\n\\n“Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten\\nit?”\\n\\n\\n“God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it is\\ntoo heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose were innocent,\\nwhy did he not say so?”\\n\\n\\n“Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His\\nsilence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular points about\\nthe case. What did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your\\nsleep?”\\n\\n\\n“They considered that it might be caused by Arthur’s closing his\\nbedroom door.”\\n\\n\\n“A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to\\nwake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of these\\ngems?”\\n\\n\\n“They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the\\nhope of finding them.”\\n\\n\\n“Have they thought of looking outside the house?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has already\\nbeen minutely examined.”\\n\\n\\n“Now, my dear sir,” said Holmes, “is it not obvious to you\\nnow that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the\\npolice were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a simple case;\\nto me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is involved by your theory.\\nYou suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your\\ndressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main\\nforce a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems\\nout of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then\\nreturned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to\\nthe greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory\\ntenable?”\\n\\n\\n“But what other is there?” cried the banker with a gesture of\\ndespair. “If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain\\nthem?”\\n\\n\\n“It is our task to find that out,” replied Holmes; “so now,\\nif you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote\\nan hour to glancing a little more closely into details.”\\n\\n\\nMy friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which I was\\neager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the\\nstory to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt of the banker’s\\nson appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still\\nI had such faith in Holmes’ judgment that I felt that there must be some\\ngrounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation.\\nHe hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with\\nhis chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest\\nthought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of\\nhope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat\\nwith me over his business affairs. A short railway journey and a shorter walk\\nbrought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier.\\n\\n\\nFairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little\\nfrom the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down\\nin front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance. On the right side\\nwas a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat\\nhedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the\\ntradesmen’s entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the stables,\\nand was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little\\nused, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all\\nround the house, across the front, down the tradesmen’s path, and so\\nround by the garden behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder\\nand I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return.\\nWe were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in.\\nShe was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which\\nseemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that\\nI have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman’s face. Her lips, too,\\nwere bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept silently\\ninto the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker\\nhad done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was\\nevidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for\\nself-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and\\npassed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.\\n\\n\\n“You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not,\\ndad?” she asked.\\n\\n\\n“No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.”\\n\\n\\n“But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman’s\\ninstincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for\\nhaving acted so harshly.”\\n\\n\\n“Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?”\\n\\n\\n“Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect\\nhim.”\\n\\n\\n“How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the\\ncoronet in his hand?”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word\\nfor it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is so\\ndreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!”\\n\\n\\n“I shall never let it drop until the gems are found—never, Mary!\\nYour affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far\\nfrom hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London to\\ninquire more deeply into it.”\\n\\n\\n“This gentleman?” she asked, facing round to me.\\n\\n\\n“No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the\\nstable lane now.”\\n\\n\\n“The stable lane?” She raised her dark eyebrows. “What can he\\nhope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will\\nsucceed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is\\ninnocent of this crime.”\\n\\n\\n“I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove\\nit,” returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his\\nshoes. “I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder. Might\\nI ask you a question or two?”\\n\\n\\n“Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.”\\n\\n\\n“You heard nothing yourself last night?”\\n\\n\\n“Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and I\\ncame down.”\\n\\n\\n“You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all\\nthe windows?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n\\n“Were they all fastened this morning?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n\\n“You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to your\\nuncle last night that she had been out to see him?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may\\nhave heard uncle’s remarks about the coronet.”\\n\\n\\n“I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and\\nthat the two may have planned the robbery.”\\n\\n\\n“But what is the good of all these vague theories,” cried the\\nbanker impatiently, “when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the\\ncoronet in his hands?”\\n\\n\\n“Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl,\\nMiss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her\\nslipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.”\\n\\n\\n“Do you know him?”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yes! he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round. His\\nname is Francis Prosper.”\\n\\n\\n“He stood,” said Holmes, “to the left of the door—that\\nis to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes, he did.”\\n\\n\\n“And he is a man with a wooden leg?”\\n\\n\\nSomething like fear sprang up in the young lady’s expressive black eyes.\\n“Why, you are like a magician,” said she. “How do you know\\nthat?” She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes’\\nthin, eager face.\\n\\n\\n“I should be very glad now to go upstairs,” said he. “I shall\\nprobably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better\\ntake a look at the lower windows before I go up.”\\n\\n\\nHe walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large one\\nwhich looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he opened and made a very\\ncareful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens. “Now\\nwe shall go upstairs,” said he at last.\\n\\n\\nThe banker’s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with a\\ngrey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the bureau first\\nand looked hard at the lock.\\n\\n\\n“Which key was used to open it?” he asked.\\n\\n\\n“That which my son himself indicated—that of the cupboard of the\\nlumber-room.”\\n\\n\\n“Have you it here?”\\n\\n\\n“That is it on the dressing-table.”\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.\\n\\n\\n“It is a noiseless lock,” said he. “It is no wonder that it\\ndid not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a\\nlook at it.” He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it\\nupon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller’s art, and\\nthe thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one side of the\\ncoronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn\\naway.\\n\\n\\n“Now, Mr. Holder,” said Holmes, “here is the corner which\\ncorresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you\\nwill break it off.”\\n\\n\\nThe banker recoiled in horror. “I should not dream of trying,” said\\nhe.\\n\\n\\n“Then I will.” Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but\\nwithout result. “I feel it give a little,” said he; “but,\\nthough I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time\\nto break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would\\nhappen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a pistol\\nshot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and\\nthat you heard nothing of it?”\\n\\n\\n“I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.”\\n\\n\\n“But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss\\nHolder?”\\n\\n\\n“I confess that I still share my uncle’s perplexity.”\\n\\n\\n“Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?”\\n\\n\\n“He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.”\\n\\n\\n“Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck\\nduring this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed\\nin clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now\\ncontinue my investigations outside.”\\n\\n\\nHe went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary\\nfootmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour or more he was at\\nwork, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as\\ninscrutable as ever.\\n\\n\\n“I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr.\\nHolder,” said he; “I can serve you best by returning to my\\nrooms.”\\n\\n\\n“But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?”\\n\\n\\n“I cannot tell.”\\n\\n\\nThe banker wrung his hands. “I shall never see them again!” he\\ncried. “And my son? You give me hopes?”\\n\\n\\n“My opinion is in no way altered.”\\n\\n\\n“Then, for God’s sake, what was this dark business which was acted\\nin my house last night?”\\n\\n\\n“If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning\\nbetween nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer. I\\nunderstand that you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only\\nthat I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may\\ndraw.”\\n\\n\\n“I would give my fortune to have them back.”\\n\\n\\n“Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then. Good-bye;\\nit is just possible that I may have to come over here again before\\nevening.”\\n\\n\\nIt was obvious to me that my companion’s mind was now made up about the\\ncase, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly\\nimagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him\\nupon the point, but he always glided away to some other topic, until at last I\\ngave it over in despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our\\nrooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes\\ndressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat,\\nhis red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.\\n\\n\\n“I think that this should do,” said he, glancing into the glass\\nabove the fireplace. “I only wish that you could come with me, Watson,\\nbut I fear that it won’t do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I\\nmay be following a will-o’-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I\\nhope that I may be back in a few hours.” He cut a slice of beef from the\\njoint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and\\nthrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.\\n\\n\\nI had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent spirits,\\nswinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it down into a\\ncorner and helped himself to a cup of tea.\\n\\n\\n“I only looked in as I passed,” said he. “I am going right\\non.”\\n\\n\\n“Where to?”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I get\\nback. Don’t wait up for me in case I should be late.”\\n\\n\\n“How are you getting on?”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since I\\nsaw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet little\\nproblem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal. However, I must not\\nsit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to\\nmy highly respectable self.”\\n\\n\\nI could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than\\nhis words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch of\\ncolour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I\\nheard the slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon\\nhis congenial hunt.\\n\\n\\nI waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I retired to\\nmy room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end\\nwhen he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise. I do\\nnot know at what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the\\nmorning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the\\nother, as fresh and trim as possible.\\n\\n\\n“You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,” said he,\\n“but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this\\nmorning.”\\n\\n\\n“Why, it is after nine now,” I answered. “I should not be\\nsurprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring.”\\n\\n\\nIt was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change which had\\ncome over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould,\\nwas now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a shade\\nwhiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful\\nthan his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into the\\narmchair which I pushed forward for him.\\n\\n\\n“I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,” said he.\\n“Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in\\nthe world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow comes\\nclose upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me.”\\n\\n\\n“Deserted you?”\\n\\n\\n“Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and\\na note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last night, in sorrow\\nand not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have been well with\\nhim. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she\\nrefers in this note:\\n\\n\\n“‘MY DEAREST UNCLE,—I feel that I have brought trouble\\nupon you, and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might\\nnever have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever again be\\nhappy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you forever. Do not worry\\nabout my future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search for\\nme, for it will be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in\\ndeath, I am ever your loving,\\n\\n\\n“‘MARY.’\\n\\n\\n“What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points to\\nsuicide?”\\n\\n\\n“No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution. I\\ntrust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.”\\n\\n\\n“Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned\\nsomething! Where are the gems?”\\n\\n\\n“You would not think Â£ 1000 apiece an excessive sum for\\nthem?”\\n\\n\\n“I would pay ten.”\\n\\n\\n“That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And\\nthere is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your cheque-book? Here is a pen.\\nBetter make it out for Â£ 4000.”\\n\\n\\nWith a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes walked over to\\nhis desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it, and\\nthrew it down upon the table.\\n\\n\\nWith a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.\\n\\n\\n“You have it!” he gasped. “I am saved! I am saved!”\\n\\n\\nThe reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he hugged his\\nrecovered gems to his bosom.\\n\\n\\n“There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,” said Sherlock\\nHolmes rather sternly.\\n\\n\\n“Owe!” He caught up a pen. “Name the sum, and I will pay\\nit.”\\n\\n\\n“No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble\\nlad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to\\nsee my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.”\\n\\n\\n“Then it was not Arthur who took them?”\\n\\n\\n“I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.”\\n\\n\\n“You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know\\nthat the truth is known.”\\n\\n\\n“He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview\\nwith him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to him, on\\nwhich he had to confess that I was right and to add the very few details which\\nwere not yet quite clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open\\nhis lips.”\\n\\n\\n“For Heaven’s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary\\nmystery!”\\n\\n\\n“I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. And\\nlet me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to\\nhear: there has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell and your\\nniece Mary. They have now fled together.”\\n\\n\\n“My Mary? Impossible!”\\n\\n\\n“It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor\\nyour son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your\\nfamily circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in England—a ruined\\ngambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience.\\nYour niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he\\nhad done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she alone had\\ntouched his heart. The devil knows best what he said, but at least she became\\nhis tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening.”\\n\\n\\n“I cannot, and I will not, believe it!” cried the banker with an\\nashen face.\\n\\n\\n“I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your\\nniece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down and talked\\nto her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane. His footmarks\\nhad pressed right through the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of\\nthe coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to\\nhis will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the\\nlove of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have\\nbeen one. She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming\\ndownstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of\\nthe servants’ escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all\\nperfectly true.\\n\\n\\n“Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he slept\\nbadly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. In the middle of the\\nnight he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose and, looking out, was\\nsurprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she\\ndisappeared into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad\\nslipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of\\nthis strange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the\\nlight of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in\\nher hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along\\nand slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see what passed\\nin the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the\\ncoronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to\\nher room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.\\n\\n\\n“As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a\\nhorrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she was gone\\nhe realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and how\\nall-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his\\nbare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane,\\nwhere he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to\\nget away, but Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle between them, your\\nlad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the\\nscuffle, your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something\\nsuddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his hands,\\nrushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed\\nthat the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to\\nstraighten it when you appeared upon the scene.”\\n\\n\\n“Is it possible?” gasped the banker.\\n\\n\\n“You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt\\nthat he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the true state\\nof affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough\\nconsideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous view, however, and\\npreserved her secret.”\\n\\n\\n“And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the\\ncoronet,” cried Mr. Holder. “Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have\\nbeen! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow\\nwanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How\\ncruelly I have misjudged him!”\\n\\n\\n“When I arrived at the house,” continued Holmes, “I at once\\nwent very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow\\nwhich might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and\\nalso that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. I passed along\\nthe tradesmen’s path, but found it all trampled down and\\nindistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen\\ndoor, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one\\nside showed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been\\ndisturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the\\ndeep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then\\nhad gone away. I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her\\nsweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so.\\nI passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks,\\nwhich I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very long\\nand complex story was written in the snow in front of me.\\n\\n\\n“There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double\\nline which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was at once\\nconvinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. The first had\\nwalked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in\\nplaces over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after\\nthe other. I followed them up and found they led to the hall window, where\\nBoots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end,\\nwhich was a hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced\\nround, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and,\\nfinally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not\\nmistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood\\nshowed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the high road at the\\nother end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to\\nthat clue.\\n\\n\\n“On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill\\nand framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see that\\nsomeone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an instep where the\\nwet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form\\nan opinion as to what had occurred. A man had waited outside the window;\\nsomeone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had\\npursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet,\\ntheir united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected.\\nHe had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his\\nopponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man, and who was\\nit brought him the coronet?\\n\\n\\n“It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible,\\nwhatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew that it\\nwas not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece and the\\nmaids. But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be\\naccused in their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his\\ncousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her\\nsecret—the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. When I remembered\\nthat you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the\\ncoronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.\\n\\n\\n“And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for who\\nelse could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? I knew\\nthat you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very limited\\none. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being\\na man of evil reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots\\nand retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered\\nhim, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say\\na word without compromising his own family.\\n\\n\\n“Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I went\\nin the shape of a loafer to Sir George’s house, managed to pick up an\\nacquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his head the night\\nbefore, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying\\na pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and saw\\nthat they exactly fitted the tracks.”\\n\\n\\n“I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,” said\\nMr. Holder.\\n\\n\\n“Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and\\nchanged my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then, for I saw\\nthat a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I knew that so astute\\na villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him.\\nAt first, of course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every particular\\nthat had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the\\nwall. I knew my man, however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he\\ncould strike. Then he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would\\ngive him a price for the stones he held—Â£ 1000 apiece. That brought out\\nthe first signs of grief that he had shown. ‘Why, dash it all!’\\nsaid he, ‘I’ve let them go at six hundred for the three!’ I\\nsoon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him\\nthat there would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering\\nI got our stones at Â£ 1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him\\nthat all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o’clock, after\\nwhat I may call a really hard day’s work.”\\n\\n\\n“A day which has saved England from a great public scandal,” said\\nthe banker, rising. “Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall\\nnot find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed exceeded\\nall that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy to apologise to\\nhim for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary,\\nit goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is\\nnow.”\\n\\n\\n“I think that we may safely say,” returned Holmes, “that she\\nis wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that whatever\\nher sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment.”\\n',\n",

It is altogether against my will that\\nI tell my reasons for opposing this contemplated invasion of the\\nantarcticâ\\x80\\x94with its vast fossil hunt and its wholesale boring and\\nmelting of the ancient ice caps. And I am the more reluctant because my\\nwarning may be in vain.\\n\\nDoubt of the real facts, as I must reveal them, is inevitable; yet,\\nif I suppressed what will seem extravagant and incredible there would\\nbe nothing left. The hitherto withheld photographs, both ordinary\\nand aÃ«rial, will count in my favor, for they are damnably vivid and\\ngraphic. Still, they will be doubted because of the great lengths to\\nwhich clever fakery can be carried. The ink drawings, of course, will\\nbe jeered at as obvious impostures; notwithstanding a strangeness and\\ntechnique which art experts ought to remark and puzzle over.\\n\\nIn the end I must rely on the judgment and standing of the few\\nscientific leaders who have, on the one hand, sufficient independence\\nof thought to weigh my data on its own hideously convincing merits or\\nin the light of certain primordial and highly baffling myth cycles;\\nand on the other hand, sufficient influence to deter the exploring\\nworld in general from any rash and over-ambitious program in the region\\nof those mountains of madness.\\n\\nIt is an unfortunate fact that relatively obscure men like myself and\\nmy associates, connected only with a small university, have little\\nchance of making an impression where matters of a wildly bizarre or\\nhighly controversial natures are concerned.\\n\\nIt is further against us that we are not, in the strictest sense,\\nspecialists in the fields which came primarily to be concerned. As a\\ngeologist, my object in leading the Miskatonic University Expedition\\nwas wholly that of securing deep-level specimens of rock and soil from\\nvarious parts of the antarctic continent, aided by the remarkable drill\\ndevised by Professor Frank H. Pabodie of our engineering department.\\n\\nI had no wish to be a pioneer in any other field than this, but I did\\nhope that the use of this new mechanical appliance at different points\\nalong previously explored paths would bring to light materials of a\\nsort hitherto unreached by the ordinary methods of collection.\\n\\nPabodie\\'s drilling apparatus, as the public already knows from our\\nreports, was unique and radical in its lightness, portability, and\\ncapacity to combine the ordinary Artesian drill principle with the\\nprinciple of the small circular rock drill in such a way as to cope\\nquickly with strata of varying hardness.\\n\\nSteel head, jointed rods, gasoline motor, collapsible wooden derrick,\\ndynamiting paraphernalia, cording, rubbish-removal auger, and sectional\\npiping for bores five inches wide and up to one thousand feet deep all\\nformed, with needed accessories, no greater load than three seven-dog\\nsledges could carry. This was made possible by the clever aluminum\\nalloy of which most of the metal objects were fashioned.\\n\\nFour large Dornier aÃ«roplanes, designed especially for the tremendous\\naltitude flying necessary on the antarctic plateau and with added\\nfuel-warming and quick-starting devices worked out by Pabodie, could\\ntransport our entire expedition from a base at the edge of the great\\nice barrier to various suitable inland points, and from these points a\\nsufficient quota of dogs would serve us.\\n\\nWe planned to cover as great an area as one antarctic seasonâ\\x80\\x94or\\nlonger, if absolutely necessaryâ\\x80\\x94would permit, operating mostly in the\\nmountain ranges and on the plateau south of Ross Sea; regions explored\\nin varying degree by Shackleton, Amundsen, Scott, and Byrd. With\\nfrequent changes of camp, made by aÃ«roplane and involving distances\\ngreat enough to be of geological significance, we expected to unearth a\\nquite unprecedented amount of materialâ\\x80\\x94especially in the pre-Cambrian\\nstrata of which so narrow a range of antarctic specimens had previously\\nbeen secured.\\n\\nWe wished also to obtain as great as possible a variety of the upper\\nfossiliferous rocks, since the primal life history of this bleak realm\\nof ice and death is of the highest importance to our knowledge of the\\nearth\\'s past. That the antarctic continent was once temperate and\\neven tropical, with a teeming vegetable and animal life of which the\\nlichens, marine fauna, arachnida, and penguins of the northern edge are\\nthe only survivors, is a matter of common information; and we hoped to\\nexpand that information in variety, accuracy, and detail. When a simple\\nboring revealed fossiliferous signs, we would enlarge the aperture by\\nblasting, in order to get specimens of suitable size and condition.\\n\\nOur borings, of varying depth according to the promise held out by the\\nupper soil or rock, were to be confined to exposed, or nearly exposed,\\nland surfacesâ\\x80\\x94these inevitably being slopes and ridges because of the\\nmile or two-mile thickness of solid ice overlying the lower levels.\\n\\nWe could not afford to waste drilling depth on any considerable amount\\nof more glaciation, though Pabodie had worked out a plan for sinking\\ncopper electrodes in thick clusters of borings and melting off limited\\nareas of ice with current from a gasoline-driven dynamo.\\n\\nIt is this planâ\\x80\\x94which we could not put into effect except\\nexperimentally on an expedition such as oursâ\\x80\\x94that the coming\\nStarkweather-Moore Expedition proposes to follow, despite the warnings\\nI have issued since our return from the antarctic.\\n\\nThe public knows of the Miskatonic Expedition through our frequent\\nwireless reports to the Arkham Advertiser and Associated Press, and\\nthrough the later articles by Pabodie and myself. We consisted of four\\nmen from the Universityâ\\x80\\x94Pabodie, Lake of the biology department,\\nAtwood of the physics departmentâ\\x80\\x94also a meteorologistâ\\x80\\x94and myself,\\nrepresenting geology and having nominal command, also sixteen\\nassistants: seven graduate students from Miskatonic and nine skilled\\nmechanics.\\n\\nOf these sixteen, twelve were qualified aÃ«roplane pilots, all but two\\nof whom were competent wireless operators. Eight of them understood\\nnavigation with compass and sextant, as did Pabodie, Atwood and I. In\\naddition, of course, our two shipsâ\\x80\\x94wooden exwhalers, reinforced for\\nice conditions and having auxiliary steamâ\\x80\\x94were fully manned.\\n\\nThe Nathaniel Derby Pickman Foundation, aided by a few special\\ncontributions, financed the expedition; hence our preparations were\\nextremely thorough, despite the absence of great publicity.\\n\\nThe dogs, sledges, machines, camp materials, and unassembled parts of\\nour five planes were delivered in Boston, and there our ships were\\nloaded.\\n\\nWe were marvelously well-equipped for our specific purposes, and in\\nall matters pertaining to supplies, regimen, transportation, and camp\\nconstruction we profited by the excellent example of our many recent\\nand exceptionally brilliant predecessors. It was the unusual number and\\nfame of these predecessors which made our own expeditionâ\\x80\\x94ample though\\nit wasâ\\x80\\x94so little noticed by the world at large.\\n\\nAs the newspapers told, we sailed from Boston Harbor on September 2nd,\\n1930, taking a leisurely course down the coast and through the Panama\\nCanal, and stopping at Samoa and Hobart, Tasmania, at which latter\\nplace we took on final supplies.\\n\\nNone of our exploring party had ever been in the polar regions before,\\nhence we all relied greatly on our ship captainsâ\\x80\\x94J. B. Douglas,\\ncommanding the brig Arkham , and serving as commander of the sea\\nparty, and Georg Thorfinnssen, commanding the barque Miskatonic â\\x80\\x94both\\nveteran whalers in antarctic waters.\\n\\nAs we left the inhabited world behind the sun sank lower and lower in\\nthe north, and stayed longer and longer above the horizon each day.\\nAt about 62Â° South Latitude we sighted our first icebergsâ\\x80\\x94tablelike\\nobjects with vertical sidesâ\\x80\\x94and just before reaching the antarctic\\ncircle, which we crossed on October 20th with appropriately quaint\\nceremonies, we were considerably troubled with field ice.\\n\\nThe falling temperature bothered me considerably after our long voyage\\nthrough the tropics, but I tried to brace up for the worse rigors to\\ncome. On many occasions the curious atmospheric effects enchanted me\\nvastly; these included a strikingly vivid mirageâ\\x80\\x94the first I had ever\\nseenâ\\x80\\x94in which distant bergs became the battlements of unimaginable\\ncosmic castles.\\n\\nPushing through the ice, which was fortunately neither extensive\\nnor thickly packed, we regained open water at South Latitude 67Â°,\\nEast Longitude 175Â°. On the morning of October 26th a strong land\\nblink appeared on the south, and before noon we all felt a thrill of\\nexcitement at beholding a vast, lofty, and snow-clad mountain chain\\nwhich opened out and covered the whole vista ahead. At last we had\\nencountered an outpost of the great unknown continent and its cryptic\\nworld of frozen death.\\n\\nThese peaks were obviously the Admiralty Range discovered by Ross, and\\nit would now be our task to round Cape Adare and sail down the east\\ncoast of Victoria Land to our contemplated base on the shore of McMurdo\\nSound, at the foot of the volcano Erebus in South Latitude 77Â° 9Â´.\\n\\nThe last lap of the voyage was vivid and fancy-stirring. Great barren\\npeaks of mystery loomed up constantly against the west as the low\\nnorthern sun of noon or the still lower horizon-grazing southern sun of\\nmidnight poured its hazy reddish rays over the white snow, bluish ice\\nand water lanes, and black bits of exposed granite slope.\\n\\nThrough the desolate summits swept raging, intermittent gusts of\\nthe terrible antarctic wind, whose cadences sometimes held vague\\nsuggestions of a wild and half-sentient musical piping, with notes\\nextending over a wide range, and which for some subconscious mnemonic\\nreason seemed to me disquieting and even dimly terrible.\\n\\nSomething about the scene reminded me of the strange and disturbing\\nAsian paintings of Nicholas Roerich, and of the still stranger and more\\ndisturbing descriptions of the evilly fabled plateau of Leng which\\noccur in the dreaded Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred. I\\nwas rather sorry, later on, that I had ever looked into that monstrous\\nbook at the college library.\\n\\nOn the 7th of November, sight of the westward range having been\\ntemporarily lost, we passed Franklin Island; and the next day descried\\nthe cones of Mts. Erebus and Terror on Ross Island ahead, with the long\\nline of the Parry Mountains beyond. There now stretched off to the east\\nthe low, white line of the great ice barrier, rising perpendicularly\\nto a height of two hundred feet like the rocky cliffs of Quebec, and\\nmarking the end of southward navigation.\\n\\nIn the afternoon we entered McMurdo Sound and stood off the coast in\\nthe lee of smoking Mt. Erebus. The scoriaceous peak towered up some\\ntwelve thousand seven hundred feet against the eastern sky, like a\\nJapanese print of the sacred Fujiyama, while beyond it rose the white,\\nghostlike height of Mt. Terror, ten thousand nine hundred feet in\\naltitude, and now extinct as a volcano.\\n\\nPuffs of smoke from Erebus came intermittently, and one of the graduate\\nassistantsâ\\x80\\x94a brilliant young fellow named Danforthâ\\x80\\x94pointed out what\\nlooked like lava on the snowy slope, remarking that this mountain,\\ndiscovered in 1840, had undoubtedly been the source of Poe\\'s image\\nwhen he wrote seven years later:\\n\\nDanforth was a great reader of bizarre material, and had talked a\\ngood deal of Poe. I was interested myself because of the antarctic\\nscene of Poe\\'s only long storyâ\\x80\\x94the disturbing and enigmatical Arthur\\nGordon Pym . On the barren shore, and on the lofty ice barrier in the\\nbackground, myriad of grotesque penguins squawked and flapped their\\nfins, while many fat seals were visible on the water, swimming or\\nsprawling across large cakes of slowly drifting ice.\\n\\nUsing small boats, we effected a difficult landing on Ross Island\\nshortly after midnight, on the morning of the 9th, carrying a line of\\ncable from each of the ships and preparing to unload supplies by means\\nof a breeches-buoy arrangement.\\n\\nOur sensations on first treading antarctic soil were poignant and\\ncomplex, even though at this particular point the Scott and Shackleton\\nexpeditions had preceded us.\\n\\nOur camp on the frozen shore below the volcano\\'s slope was only a\\nprovisional one, headquarters being kept aboard the Arkham . We landed\\nall our drilling apparatus, dogs, sledges, tents, provisions, gasoline\\ntanks, experimental ice-melting outfit, cameras, both ordinary and\\naÃ«rial, aÃ«roplane parts, and other accessories, including three small\\nportable wireless outfitsâ\\x80\\x94besides those in the planesâ\\x80\\x94capable of\\ncommunicating with the Arkham\\'s large outfit from any part of the\\nantarctic continent that we would be likely to visit.\\n\\nThe ship\\'s outfit, communicating with the outside world, was to convey\\npress reports to the Arkham Advertiser\\'s powerful wireless station\\non Kingsport Head, Mass. We hoped to complete our work during a single\\nantarctic summer; but if this proved impossible we would winter on the Arkham , sending the Miskatonic north before the freezing of the ice\\nfor another summer\\'s supplies.\\n\\nI need not repeat what the newspapers have already published about our\\nearly work: of our ascent of Mt. Erebus; our successful mineral borings\\nat several points on Ross Island and the singular speed with which\\nPabodie\\'s apparatus accomplished them, even through solid rock layers;\\nour provisional test of the small ice-melting equipment; our perilous\\nascent of the great barrier with sledges and supplies; and our final\\nassembling of five huge aÃ«roplanes at the camp atop the barrier.\\n\\nThe health of our land partyâ\\x80\\x94twenty men and fifty-five Alaskan sledge\\ndogsâ\\x80\\x94was remarkable, though of course we had so far encountered no\\nreally destructive temperatures or windstorms.\\n\\nFor the most part, the thermometer varied between zero and 20Â° or 25Â°\\nabove, and our experience with New England winters had accustomed us to\\nrigors of this sort. The barrier camp was semipermanent, and destined\\nto be a storage cache for gasoline, provisions, dynamite, and other\\nsupplies.\\n\\nOnly four of our planes were needed to carry the actual exploring\\nmaterial, the fifth being left with a pilot and two men, from the\\nships, at the storage cache to form a means of reaching us from the Arkham in case all our exploring planes were lost.\\n\\nLater, when not using all the other planes for moving apparatus, we\\nwould employ one or two in a shuttle transportation service between\\nthis cache and another permanent base on the great plateau from six\\nhundred to seven hundred miles southward, beyond Beardmore Glacier.\\n\\nDespite the almost unanimous accounts of appalling winds and tempests\\nthat pour down from the plateau, we determined to dispense with\\nintermediate bases, taking our chances in the interest of economy and\\nprobable efficiency.\\n\\nWireless reports have spoken of the breathtaking, four-hour, nonstop\\nflight of our squadron on November 21st over the lofty shelf ice, with\\nvast peaks rising on the west, and the unfathomed silences echoing to\\nthe sound of our engines.\\n\\nWind troubled us only moderately, and our radio compasses helped us\\nthrough the one opaque fog we encountered. When the vast rise loomed\\nahead, between Latitudes 83Â° and 84Â°, we knew we had reached Beardmore\\nGlacier, the largest valley glacier in the world, and that the frozen\\nsea was now giving place to a frowning and mountainous coast line.\\n\\nAt last we were truly entering the white, Ã¦on-dead world of the\\nultimate south. Even as we realized it we saw the peak of Mt. Nansen\\nin the eastern distance, towering up to its height of almost fifteen\\nthousand feet.\\n\\nThe successful establishment of the southern base above the glacier in\\nLatitude 86Â° 7Â´, East Longitude 174Â° 23Â´, and the phenomenally rapid\\nand effective borings and blastings made at various points reached by\\nour sledge trips and short aÃ«roplane flights, are matters of history;\\nas is the arduous and triumphant ascent of Mt. Nansen by Pabodie and\\ntwo of the graduate studentsâ\\x80\\x94Gedney and Carrollâ\\x80\\x94on December 13th to\\n15th.\\n\\nWe were some eight thousand five hundred feet above sea-level. When\\nexperimental drillings revealed solid ground only twelve feet down\\nthrough the snow and ice at certain points, we made considerable use of\\nthe small melting apparatus and sunk bores and performed dynamiting at\\nmany places, where no previous explorer had ever thought of securing\\nmineral specimens.\\n\\nThe pre-Cambrian granites and beacon sandstones thus obtained confirmed\\nour belief that this plateau was homogeneous, with the great bulk of\\nthe continent to the west, but somewhat different from the parts lying\\neastward below South Americaâ\\x80\\x94which we then thought to form a separate\\nand smaller continent divided from the larger one by a frozen junction\\nof Ross and Weddell Seas, though Byrd has since disproved the report.\\n\\nIn certain of the sandstones, dynamited and chiseled after boring\\nrevealed their nature, we found some highly interesting fossil markings\\nand fragments; notably ferns, seaweeds, trilobites, crinoids, and such\\nmollusks as linguellÃ¦ and gastropodsâ\\x80\\x94all of which seemed of real\\nsignificance in connection with the region\\'s primordial history. There\\nwas also a queer triangular, striated marking, about a foot in greatest\\ndiameter, which Lake pieced together from three fragments of slate\\nbrought up from a deep-blasted aperture.\\n\\nThese fragments came from a point to the westward, near the Queen\\nAlexandra Range; and Lake, as a biologist, seemed to find their curious\\nmarking unusually puzzling and provocative, though to my geological eye\\nit looked not unlike some of the ripple effects reasonably common in\\nthe sedimentary rocks.\\n\\nSince slate is no more than a metamorphic formation into which a\\nsedimentary stratum is pressed, and since the pressure itself produces\\nodd distorting effects on any markings which may exist, I saw no reason\\nfor extreme wonder over the striated depression.\\n\\nOn January 6, 1931, Lake, Pabodie, Daniels, all six of the students,\\nfour mechanics, and myself flew directly over the south pole in two\\nof the great planes, being forced down once by a sudden high wind,\\nwhich, fortunately, did not develop into a typical storm. This was,\\nas the papers have stated, one of several observation flights, during\\nothers of which we tried to discern new topographical features in areas\\nunreached by previous explorers.\\n\\nOur early flights were disappointing in this latter respect, though\\nthey afforded us some magnificent examples of the richly fantastic and\\ndeceptive mirages of the polar regions, of which our sea voyage had\\ngiven us some brief foretastes.\\n\\nDistant mountains floated in the sky as enchanted cities, and often the\\nwhole white world would dissolve into a gold, silver, and scarlet land\\nof Dunsanian dreams and adventurous expectancy under the magic of the\\nlow midnight sun.\\n\\nOn cloudy days we had considerable trouble in flying, owing to the\\ntendency of snowy earth and sky to merge into one mystical opalescent\\nvoid with no visible horizon to mark the junction of the two.\\n\\nAt length we resolved to carry out our original plan of flying five\\nhundred miles eastward with all four exploring planes and establishing\\na fresh sub-base at a point which would probably be on the smaller\\ncontinental division, as we mistakenly conceived it. Geological\\nspecimens obtained there would be desirable for purposes of comparison.\\n\\nOur health so far had remained excellentâ\\x80\\x94lime juice well offsetting\\nthe steady diet of tinned and salted food, and temperatures generally\\nabove zero enabling us to do without our thickest furs.\\n\\nIt was now midsummer, and with haste and care we might be able to\\nconclude work by March and avoid a tedious wintering through the long\\nantarctic night. Several savage windstorms had burst upon us from the\\nwest, but we had escaped damage through the skill of Atwood in devising\\nrudimentary aÃ«roplane shelters and windbreaks of heavy snow blocks, and\\nin reinforcing the principal camp buildings with snow. Our good luck\\nand efficiency had indeed been almost uncanny.\\n\\nThe outside world knew, of course, of our program, and was told also\\nof Lake\\'s strange and dogged insistence on a westwardâ\\x80\\x94or rather,\\nnorthwestwardâ\\x80\\x94prospecting trip before our radical shift to the new\\nbase.\\n\\nIt seems that he had pondered a great deal and with alarmingly radical\\ndaring over that triangular striated marking in the slate; reading into\\nit certain contradictions in nature and geological period which whetted\\nhis curiosity to the utmost, and made him avid to sink more borings\\nand blastings in the west-stretching formation to which the exhumed\\nfragments evidently belonged.\\n\\nHe was strangely convinced that the marking was the print of some\\nbulky, unknown, and radically unclassifiable organism of considerably\\nadvanced evolution, notwithstanding that the rock which bore it was of\\nso vastly ancient a dateâ\\x80\\x94Cambrian if not actually pre-Cambrianâ\\x80\\x94as to\\npreclude the probable existence not only of all highly evolved life,\\nbut of any life at all above the unicellular or at most the trilobite\\nstage. These fragments, with their odd marking, must have been five\\nhundred million to a thousand million years old.\\n\\nII.\\n\\nPopular imagination, I judge, responded actively to our wireless\\nbulletins of Lake\\'s start northwestward into regions never trodden\\nby human foot or penetrated by human imagination, though we did not\\nmention his wild hopes of revolutionizing the entire sciences of\\nbiology and geology.\\n\\nHis preliminary sledging and boring journey of January 11th to 18th\\nwith Pabodie and five othersâ\\x80\\x94marred by the loss of two dogs in an\\nupset when crossing one of the great pressure ridges in the iceâ\\x80\\x94had\\nbrought up more and more of the ArchÃ¦an slate; and even I was\\ninterested by the singular profusion of evident fossil markings in that\\nunbelievably ancient stratum.\\n\\nThese markings, however, were of very primitive life forms involving\\nno great paradox except that any life forms should occur in rock as\\ndefinitely pre-Cambrian as this seemed to be; hence I still failed to\\nsee the good sense of Lake\\'s demand for an interlude in our time-saving\\nprogramâ\\x80\\x94an interlude requiring the use of all four planes, many men,\\nand the whole of the expedition\\'s mechanical apparatus.\\n\\nI did not, in the end, veto the plan, though I decided not to accompany\\nthe northwestward party despite Lake\\'s plea for my geological advice.\\nWhile they were gone, I would remain at the base with Pabodie and five\\nmen and work out final plans for the eastward shift. In preparation for\\nthis transfer, one of the planes had begun to move up a good gasoline\\nsupply from McMurdo Sound; but this could wait temporarily. I kept\\nwith me one sledge and nine dogs, since it is unwise to be at any time\\nwithout possible transportation in an utterly tenantless world of\\nÃ¦on-long death.\\n\\nLake\\'s subexpedition into the unknown, as every one will recall, sent\\nout its own reports from the short-wave transmitters on the planes;\\nthese being simultaneously picked up by our apparatus at the southern\\nbase and by the Arkham at McMurdo Sound, whence they were relayed to\\nthe outside world on wave lengths up to fifty meters.\\n\\nThe start was made January 22nd at 4 a.m.; and the first wireless\\nmessage we received came only two hours later, when Lake spoke of\\ndescending and starting a small-scale ice-melting and bore at a point\\nsome three hundred miles away from us. Six hours after that a second\\nand very excited message told of the frantic, beaverlike work whereby a\\nshallow shaft had been sunk and blasted, culminating in the discovery\\nof slate fragments with several markings approximately like the one\\nwhich had caused the original puzzlement.\\n\\nThree hours later a brief bulletin announced the resumption of the\\nflight in the teeth of a raw and piercing gale; and when I dispatched\\na message of protest against further hazards, Lake replied curtly that\\nhis new specimens made any hazard worth taking.\\n\\nI saw that his excitement had reached the point of mutiny, and that I\\ncould do nothing to check this headlong risk of the whole expedition\\'s\\nsuccess; but it was appalling to think of his plunging deeper and\\ndeeper into that treacherous and sinister white immensity of tempests\\nand unfathomed mysteries which stretched off for some fifteen hundred\\nmiles to the half-known, half-suspected coast line of Queen Mary and\\nKnox Lands.\\n\\nThen, in about an hour and a half more, came that doubly excited\\nmessage from Lake\\'s moving plane, which almost reversed my sentiments\\nand made me wish I had accompanied the party:\\n\\n\"10:05 p.m. On the wing. After snowstorm, have spied mountain range\\nahead higher than any hitherto seen. May equal Himalayas, allowing\\nfor height of plateau. Probable Latitude 76Â° 15Â´, Longitude 113Â° 10Â´\\nE. Reaches far as can see to right and left. Suspicion of two smoking\\ncones. All peaks black and bare of snow. Gale blowing off them impedes\\nnavigation.\"\\n\\nAfter that Pabodie, the men, and I hung breathlessly over the receiver.\\nThought of this titanic mountain rampart seven hundred miles away\\ninflamed our deepest sense of adventure; and we rejoiced that our\\nexpedition, if not ourselves personally, had been its discoverers. In\\nhalf an hour Lake called us again:\\n\\n\"Moulton\\'s plane forced down on plateau in foothills, but nobody hurt\\nand perhaps can repair. Shall transfer essentials to other three for\\nreturn or further moves if necessary, but no more heavy plane travel\\nneeded just now. Mountains surpass anything in imagination. Am going\\nup scouting in Carroll\\'s plane, with all weight out.\\n\\n\"You can\\'t imagine anything like this. Highest peaks must go over\\nthirty-five thousand feet. Everest out of the running, Atwood to work\\nout height with theodolite while Carroll and I go up. Probably wrong\\nabout cones, for formations look stratified. Possibly pre-Cambrian\\nslate with other strata mixed in. Queer sky line effectsâ\\x80\\x94regular\\nsections of cubes clinging to highest peaks. Whole thing marvelous in\\nred-gold light of low sun. Like land of mystery in a dream or gateway\\nto forbidden world of untrodden wonder. Wish you were here to study.\"\\n\\nThough it was technically sleeping time, not one of us listeners\\nthought for a moment of retiring. It must have been a good deal\\nthe same at McMurdo Sound, where the supply cache and the Arkham were also getting the messages; for Captain Douglas gave out a call\\ncongratulating everybody on the important find, and Sherman, the cache\\noperator, seconded his sentiments. We were sorry, of course, about the\\ndamaged aÃ«roplane, but hoped it could be easily mended. Then, at eleven\\np.m., came another call from Lake:\\n\\n\"Up with Carroll over highest foothills. Don\\'t dare try really tall\\npeaks in present weather, but shall later. Frightful work climbing,\\nand hard going at this altitude, but worth it. Great range fairly\\nsolid, hence can\\'t get any glimpses beyond. Main summits exceed\\nHimalayas, and very queer. Range looks like pre-Cambrian slate, with\\nplain signs of many other upheaved strata. Was wrong about volcanism.\\nGoes farther in either direction than we can see. Swept clear of snow\\nabove about twenty-one thousand feet.\\n\\n\"Odd formations on slopes of highest mountains. Great low square\\nblocks with exactly vertical sides, and rectangular lines of low,\\nvertical ramparts, like the old Asian castles clinging to steep\\nmountains in Roerich\\'s paintings. Impressive from distance. Flew close\\nto some, and Carroll thought they were formed of smaller separate\\npieces, but that is probably weathering. Most edges crumbled and\\nrounded off as if exposed to storms and climate changes for millions\\nof years.\\n\\n\"Parts, especially upper parts, seem to be of lighter-colored\\nrock than any visible strata on slopes proper, hence an evidently\\ncrystalline origin. Close flying shows many cave mouths, some\\nunusually regular in outline, square or semicircular. You must come\\nand investigate. Think I saw rampart squarely on top of one peak.\\nHeight seems about thirty thousand to thirty-five thousand feet. Am up\\ntwenty-one thousand five hundred myself, in devilish, gnawing cold.\\nWind whistles and pipes through passes and in and out of caves, but no\\nflying danger so far.\"\\n\\nFrom then on for another half hour Lake kept up a running fire of\\ncomment, and expressed his intention of climbing some of the peaks on\\nfoot. I replied that I would join him as soon as he could send a plane,\\nand that Pabodie and I would work out the best gasoline planâ\\x80\\x94just\\nwhere and how to concentrate our supply in view of the expedition\\'s\\naltered character.\\n\\nObviously, Lake\\'s boring operations, as well as his aÃ«roplane\\nactivities, would need a great deal delivered at the new base which\\nhe was to establish at the foot of the mountains; and it was possible\\nthat the eastward flight might not be made, after all, this season. In\\nconnection with this business I called Captain Douglas and asked him to\\nget as much as possible out of the ships and up the barrier with the\\nsingle dog team we had left there. A direct route across the unknown\\nregion between Lake and McMurdo Sound was what we really ought to\\nestablish.\\n\\nLake called me later to say that he had decided to let the camp stay\\nwhere Moulton\\'s plane had been forced down, and where repairs had\\nalready progressed somewhat. The ice sheet was very thin, with dark\\nground here and there visible, and he would sink some borings and\\nblasts at that very point before making any sledge trips or climbing\\nexpeditions.\\n\\nHe spoke of the ineffable majesty of the whole scene, and the queer\\nstate of his sensations at being in the lee of vast, silent pinnacles,\\nwhose ranks shot up like a wall reaching the sky at the world\\'s rim.\\n\\nIt was a queer state of sensationsâ\\x80\\x94being in the lee of vast, silent pinnacles, where ranks shot up like a wall reaching the sky at the world\\'s rim.\\n\\nAtwood\\'s theodolite observations had placed the height of the five\\ntallest peaks at from thirty thousand to thirty-four thousand feet.\\n\\nThe windswept nature of the terrain clearly disturbed Lake, for it\\nargued the occasional existence of prodigious gales, violent beyond\\nanything we had so far encountered. His camp lay a little more than\\nfive miles from where the higher foothills rose abruptly.\\n\\nI could almost trace a note of subconscious alarm in his wordsâ\\x80\\x94flashed\\nacross a glacial void of seven hundred milesâ\\x80\\x94as he urged that we all\\nhasten with the matter and get the strange, new region disposed of as\\nsoon as possible. He was about to rest now, after a continuous day\\'s\\nwork of almost unparalleled speed, strenuousness, and results.\\n\\nIn the morning I had a three-cornered wireless talk with Lake and\\nCaptain Douglas at their widely separated bases. It was agreed that one\\nof Lake\\'s planes would come to my base for Pabodie, the five men, and\\nmyself, as well as for all the fuel it could carry. The rest of the\\nfuel question, depending on our decision about an easterly trip, could\\nwait for a few days, since Lake had enough for immediate camp heat and\\nborings.\\n\\nEventually the old southern base ought to be restocked, but if we\\npostponed the easterly trip we would not use it till the next summer,\\nand, meanwhile, Lake must send a plane to explore a direct route\\nbetween his new mountains and McMurdo Sound.\\n\\nPabodie and I prepared to close our base for a short or long period, as\\nthe case might be. If we wintered in the antarctic we would probably\\nfly straight from Lake\\'s base to the Arkham without returning to\\nthis spot. Some of our conical tents had already been reinforced by\\nblocks of hard snow, and now we decided to complete the job of making a\\npermanent village. Owing to a very liberal tent supply, Lake had with\\nhim all that his base would need, even after our arrival. I wirelessed\\nthat Pabodie and I would be ready for the northwestward move after one\\nday\\'s work and one night\\'s rest.\\n\\nOur labors, however, were not very steady after four p.m., for about\\nthat time Lake began sending in the most extraordinary and excited\\nmessages. His working day had started unpropitiously, since an\\naÃ«roplane survey of the nearly exposed rock surfaces showed an entire\\nabsence of those ArchÃ¦an and primordial strata for which he was\\nlooking, and which formed so great a part of the colossal peaks that\\nloomed up at a tantalizing distance from the camp.\\n\\nMost of the rocks glimpsed were apparently Jurassic and Comanchean\\nsandstones and Permian and Triassic schists, with now and then a glossy\\nblack outcropping suggesting a hard and slaty coal.\\n\\nThis rather discouraged Lake, whose plans all hinged on unearthing\\nspecimens more than five hundred million years older. It was clear\\nto him that in order to recover the ArchÃ¦an slate vein in which he\\nhad found the odd markings, he would have to make a long sledge trip\\nfrom these foothills to the steep slopes of the gigantic mountains\\nthemselves.\\n\\nHe had resolved, nevertheless, to do some local boring as part of the\\nexpedition\\'s general program; hence, he set up the drill and put five\\nmen to work with it while the rest finished settling the camp and\\nrepairing the damaged aÃ«roplane. The softest visible rockâ\\x80\\x94a sandstone\\nabout a quarter of a mile from the campâ\\x80\\x94had been chosen for the\\nfirst sampling; and the drill made excellent progress without much\\nsupplementary blasting.\\n\\nIt was about three hours afterward, following the first really heavy\\nblast of the operation, that the shouting of the drill crew was heard;\\nand that young Gedneyâ\\x80\\x94the acting foremanâ\\x80\\x94rushed into the camp with\\nthe startling news.\\n\\nThey had struck a cave. Early in the boring the sandstone had given\\nplace to a vein of Comanchean limestone, full of minute fossil\\ncephalopods, corals, echini, and spirifera, and with occasional\\nsuggestions of siliceous sponges and marine vertebrate bonesâ\\x80\\x94the\\nlatter probably of teliosts, sharks, and ganoids.\\n\\nThis, in itself, was important enough, as affording the first\\nvertebrate fossils the expedition had yet secured; but when shortly\\nafterward the drill head dropped through the stratum into apparent\\nvacancy, a wholly new and doubly intense wave of excitement spread\\namong the excavators.\\n\\nA good-sized blast had laid open the subterrane secret; and now,\\nthrough a jagged aperture perhaps five feet across and three feet\\nthick, there yawned before the avid searchers a section of shallow\\nlimestone hollowing worn more than fifty million years ago by the\\ntrickling ground waters of a bygone tropic world.\\n\\nThe hollowed layer was not more than seven or eight feet deep, but\\nextended off indefinitely in all directions and had a fresh, slightly\\nmoving air which suggested its membership in an extensive subterranean\\nsystem. Its roof and floor were abundantly equipped with large\\nstalactites and stalagmites, some of which met in columnar form.\\n\\nBut important above all else was the vast deposit of shells and bones,\\nwhich in places nearly choked the passage. Washed down from unknown\\njungles of Mesozoic tree ferns and fungi, and forests of Tertiary\\ncycads, fan palms, and primitive angiosperms, this osseous medley\\ncontained representatives of more Cretaceous, Eocene, and other\\nanimal species than the greatest palÃ¦ontologist could have counted or\\nclassified in a year. Mollusks, crustacean armor, fishes, amphibians,\\nreptiles, birds, and early mammalsâ\\x80\\x94great and small, known and unknown.\\n\\nNo wonder Gedney ran back to the camp shouting, and no wonder every one\\nelse dropped work and rushed headlong through the biting cold to where\\nthe tall derrick marked a new-found gateway to secrets of inner earth\\nand vanished Ã¦ons.\\n\\nWhen Lake had satisfied the first keen edge of his curiosity he\\nscribbled a message in his notebook and had young Moulton run back to\\nthe camp to dispatch it by wireless.\\n\\nThis was my first word of the discovery, and it told of the\\nidentification of early shells, bones of ganoids and placoderms,\\nremnants of labyrinthodonta and thecoiidea, great mosasaur skull\\nfragments, dinosaur vertebrÃ¦ and armor plates, pterodactyl teeth and\\nwing bones, Archaeopteryx dÃ©bris, Miocene sharks\\' teeth, primitive\\nbird skulls, and other bones of archaic mammals such as PalÃ¦otheres,\\nXiphodons, Eohippi, Oreodons, and TitanotheriidÃ¦.\\n\\nThere was nothing as recent as a mastodon, elephant, true camel, deer,\\nor bovine animal; hence Lake concluded that the last deposits had\\noccurred during the Oligocene Age, and that the hollowed stratum had\\nlain in its present dried, dead, and inaccessible state for at least\\nthirty million years.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the prevalence of very early life forms was singular\\nin the highest degree. Though the limestone formation was, on the\\nevidence of such typical imbedded fossils as ventriculites, positively\\nand unmistakably Comanchean and not a particle earlier; the free\\nfragments in the hollow space included a surprising proportion from\\norganisms hitherto considered as peculiar to far older periodsâ\\x80\\x94even\\nrudimentary fishes, mollusks, and corals as remote as the Silurian or\\nOrdovician.\\n\\nThe inevitable inference was that in this part of the world there had\\nbeen a remarkable and unique degree of continuity between the life of\\nover three hundred million years ago and that of only thirty million\\nyears ago. How far this continuity had extended beyond the Oligocene\\nAge when the cavern was closed was of course past all speculation.\\n\\nIn any event, the coming of the frightful ice in the Pleistocene some\\nfive hundred thousand years agoâ\\x80\\x94a mere yesterday as compared with the\\nage of this cavityâ\\x80\\x94must have put an end to any of the primal forms\\nwhich had locally managed to outlive their common terms.\\n\\nLake was not content to let his first message stand, but had another\\nbulletin written and dispatched across the snow to the camp before\\nMoulton could get back. After that Moulton stayed at the wireless in\\none of the planes, transmitting to meâ\\x80\\x94and to the Arkham for relaying\\nto the outside worldâ\\x80\\x94the frequent postscripts which Lake sent him by a\\nsuccession of messengers.\\n\\nThose who followed the newspapers will remember the excitement created\\namong men of science by that afternoon\\'s reportsâ\\x80\\x94reports which have\\nfinally led, after all these years, to the organization of that very\\nStarkweather-Moore Expedition which I am so anxious to dissuade from\\nits purposes. I had better give the messages literally as Lake sent\\nthem, and as our base operator McTighe translated them from his pencil\\nshorthand:\\n\\nFowler makes discovery of highest importance in sandstone and\\nlimestone fragments from blasts. Several distinct triangular striated\\nprints like those in archÃ¦an slate, proving that source survived from\\nover six hundred million years ago to Comanchean times without more\\nthan moderate morphological changes and decrease in average size.\\nComanchean prints apparently more primitive or decadent, if anything,\\nthan older ones. Emphasize importance of discovery in press. Will\\nmean to biology what Einstein has meant to mathematics and physics.\\nJoins up with my previous work and amplifies conclusions.\\n\\nAppears to indicate, as I suspected, that earth has seen whole cycle\\nor cycles of organic life before known one that begins with ArchÃ¦ozoic\\ncells. Was evolved and specialized not later than a thousand million\\nyears ago, when planet was young and recently uninhabitable for any\\nlife forms of normal protoplasmic structure. Question arises when,\\nwhere, and how development took place.\\n\\nLater. Examining certain skeletal fragments of large land and marine\\nsaurians and primitive mammals, find singular local wounds or injuries\\nto bony structure not attributable to any known predatory or\\ncarnivorous animal of any period. Of two sortsâ\\x80\\x94straight, penetrant\\nbores, and apparently hacking incisions. One or two cases of cleanly\\nsevered bones. Not many specimens affected. Am sending to camp for\\nelectric torches. Will extend search area underground by hacking away\\nstalactites.\\n\\nStill later. Have found peculiar soapstone fragment about six inches\\nacross and an inch and a half thick, wholly unlike any visible local\\nformationâ\\x80\\x94greenish, but no evidences to place its period. Has curious\\nsmoothness and regularity. Shaped like five-pointed star with tips\\nbroken off, and signs of other cleavage at inward angles and in center\\nof surface. Small, smooth depression in center of unbroken surface.\\nArouses much curiosity as to source and weathering. Probably some\\nfreak of water action. Carroll, with magnifier, thinks he can make\\nout additional markings of geologic significance. Groups of tiny dots\\nin regular patterns. Dogs growing uneasy as we work, and seem to hate\\nthis soapstone. Must see if it has any peculiar odor. Will report\\nagain when Mills gets back with light and we start on underground area.\\n\\n10:15 p.m. Important discovery. Orrendorf and Watkins, working\\nunderground at 9:45 with light, found monstrous barrel-shaped fossil\\nof wholly unknown nature; probably vegetable unless overgrown specimen\\nof unknown marine radiata. Tissue evidently preserved by mineral\\nsalts. Tough as leather, but astonishing flexibility retained in\\nplaces. Marks of broken-off parts at ends and around sides. Six feet\\nend to end, three and five tenths feet central diameter, tapering to\\none foot at each end. Like a barrel with five bulging ridges in place\\nof staves. Lateral breakages, as of thinnish stalks, are at equator\\nin middle of these ridges. In furrows between ridges are curious\\ngrowthsâ\\x80\\x94combs or wings that fold up and spread out like fans. All\\ngreatly damaged but one, which gives almost seven-foot wing spread.\\nArrangement reminds one of certain monsters of primal myth, especially\\nfabled Elder Things in Necronomicon .\\n\\nThese wings seem to be membranous, stretched on framework of glandular\\ntubing. Apparent minute orifices in frame tubing at wing tips. Ends\\nof body shriveled, giving no clue to interior or to what has been\\nbroken off there. Must dissect when we get back to camp. Can\\'t decide\\nwhether vegetable or animal. Many features obviously of almost\\nincredible primitiveness. Have set all hands cutting stalactites and\\nlooking for further specimens. Additional scarred bones found, but\\nthese must wait. Having trouble with dogs. They can\\'t endure the new\\nspecimen, and would probably tear it to pieces if we didn\\'t keep it at\\na distance from them.\\n\\n11:30 p.m. Attention, Dyer, Pabodie, Douglas. Matter of highestâ\\x80\\x94I\\nmight say transcendentâ\\x80\\x94importance. Arkham must relay to Kingsport\\nHead Station at once. Strange barrel growth is the archÃ¦an thing that\\nleft prints in rocks. Mills, Boudreau, and Fowler discover cluster of\\nthirteen more at underground point forty feet from aperture. Mixed\\nwith curiously rounded and configured soapstone fragments smaller than\\none previously foundâ\\x80\\x94star-shaped, but no marks of breakage except at\\nsome of the points.\\n\\nOf organic specimens, eight apparently perfect, with all appendages.\\nHave brought all to surface, leading off dogs to distance. They cannot\\nstand the things. Give close attention to description and repeat back\\nfor accuracy. Papers must get this right.\\n\\nObjects are eight feet long all over. Six-foot, five-ridged barrel\\ntorso three and five tenths feet central diameter, one foot end\\ndiameters. Dark gray, flexible, and infinitely tough. Seven-foot\\nmembranous wings of same color, found folded, spread out of furrows\\nbetween ridges. Wing framework tubular or glandular, or lighter gray,\\nwith orifices at wing tips. Spread wings have serrated edge. Around\\nequator, one at central apex of each of the five vertical, stavelike\\nridges, are five systems of light-gray flexible arms or tentacles\\nfound tightly folded to torso but expansible to maximum length of over\\nthree feet. Like arms of primitive crinoid. Single stalks three inches\\ndiameter branch after six inches into five substalks, each of which\\nbranches after eight inches into five small, tapering tentacles or\\ntendrils, giving each stalk a total of twenty-five tentacles.\\n\\nAt top of torso blunt, bulbous neck of lighter gray, with gill-like\\nsuggestions, holds yellowish five-pointed starfish-shaped apparent\\nhead covered with three-inch wiry cilia of various prismatic colors.\\n\\nHead thick and puffy, about two feet point to point, with three-inch\\nflexible yellowish tubes projecting from each point. Slit in exact\\ncenter of top probably breathing aperture. At end of each tube is\\nspherical expansion where yellowish membrane rolls back on handling to\\nreveal glassy, red-irised globe, evidently an eye.\\n\\nFive slightly longer reddish tubes start from inner angles of\\nstarfish-shaped head and end in saclike swellings of same color\\nwhich, upon pressure, open to bell-shaped orifices two inches maximum\\ndiameter and lined with sharp, white tooth-like projectionsâ\\x80\\x94probable\\nmouths. All these tubes, cilia, and points of starfish head, found\\nfolded tightly down; tubes and points clinging to bulbous neck and\\ntorso. Flexibility surprising despite vast toughness.\\n\\nAt bottom of torso, rough but dissimilarly functioning counterparts of\\nhead arrangements exist. Bulbous light-gray pseudoneck, without gill\\nsuggestions, holds greenish five-pointed starfish arrangement.\\n\\nTough, muscular arms four feet long and tapering from seven inches\\ndiameter at base to about two and five tenths at point. To each point\\nis attached small end of a greenish five-veined membranous triangle\\neight inches long and six wide at farther end. This is the paddle,\\nfin, or pseudofoot which had made prints in rocks from a thousand\\nmillion to fifty or sixty million years old.\\n\\nFrom inner angles of starfish arrangement project two-foot reddish\\ntubes tapering from three inches diameter at base to one at tip.\\nOrifices at tips. All these parts infinitely tough and leathery,\\nbut extremely flexible. Four-foot arms with paddles undoubtedly\\nused for locomotion of some sort, marine or otherwise. When moved,\\ndisplay suggestions of exaggerated muscularity. As found, all\\nthese projections tightly folded over pseudoneck and end of torso,\\ncorresponding to projections at other end.\\n\\nCannot yet assign positively to animal or vegetable kingdom, but odds\\nnow favor animal. Probably represents incredibly advanced evolution\\nof radiata without loss of certain primitive features. Echinoderm\\nresemblances unmistakable despite local contradictory evidences.\\n\\nWing structure puzzles in view of probable marine habitat, but may\\nhave use in water navigation. Symmetry is curiously vegetablelike,\\nsuggesting vegetable\\'s essential up-and-down structure rather than\\nanimal\\'s fore-and-aft structure. Fabulously early date of evolution,\\npreceding even simplest archÃ¦an Protozoa hitherto known, baffles all\\nconjecture as to origin.\\n\\nComplete specimens have such uncanny resemblance to certain creatures\\nof primal myth that suggestion of ancient existence outside antarctic\\nbecomes inevitable. Dyer and Pabodie have read Necronomicon and\\nseen Clark Ashton Smith\\'s nightmare paintings based on text, and will\\nunderstand when I speak of Elder Things supposed to have created all\\nearth life as jest or mistake. Students have always thought conception\\nformed from morbid imaginative treatment of very ancient tropical\\nradiata. Also like prehistoric folklore things Wilmarth has spoken\\nofâ\\x80\\x94Cthulhu cult appendages, etc.\\n\\nVast field of study opened. Deposits probably of late Cretaceous\\nor early Eocene period, judging from associated specimens. Massive\\nstalagmites deposited above them. Hard work hewing out, but toughness\\nprevented damage. State of preservation miraculous, evidently owing to\\nlimestone action. No more found so far, but will resume search later.\\nJob now to get fourteen huge specimens to camp without dogs, which\\nbark furiously and can\\'t be trusted near them.\\n\\nWith nine menâ\\x80\\x94three left to guard the dogsâ\\x80\\x94we ought to manage the\\nthree sledges fairly well, though wind is bad. Must establish plane\\ncommunication with McMurdo Sound and begin shipping material. But\\nI\\'ve got to dissect one of these things before we take any rest. Wish\\nI had a real laboratory here. Dyer better kick himself for having\\ntried to stop my westward trip. First the world\\'s greatest mountains,\\nand then this. If this last isn\\'t the high spot of the expedition, I\\ndon\\'t know what is. We\\'re made scientifically. Congrats, Pabodie, on\\nthe drill that opened up the cave. Now will Arkham please repeat\\ndescription?\\n\\n\" I\\'ve got to dissect one of these things before â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94\"\\n\\n\" First the world\\'s greatest mountainsâ\\x80\\x94then this! \"\\n\\nThe sensations of Pabodie and myself at receipt of this report were\\nalmost beyond description, nor were our companions much behind us in\\nenthusiasm. McTighe, who had hastily translated a few high spots as\\nthey came from the droning receiving set, wrote out the entire message\\nfrom his shorthand version, as soon as Lake\\'s operator signed off.\\n\\nAll appreciated the epoch-making significance of the discovery, and\\nI sent Lake congratulations as soon as the Arkham\\'s operator had\\nrepeated back the descriptive parts as requested; and my example was\\nfollowed by Sherman from his station at the McMurdo Sound supply cache,\\nas well as by Captain Douglas of the Arkham .\\n\\nLater, as head of the expedition, I added some remarks to be relayed\\nthrough the Arkham to the outside world. Of course, rest was an\\nabsurd thought amidst this excitement; and my only wish was to get to\\nLake\\'s camp as quickly as I could. It disappointed me when he sent word\\nthat a rising mountain gale made early aÃ«rial travel impossible.\\n\\nBut within an hour and a half interest again rose to banish\\ndisappointment. Lake, sending more messages, told of the completely\\nsuccessful transportation of the fourteen great specimens to the camp.\\nIt had been a hard pull, for the things were surprisingly heavy; but\\nnine men had accomplished it very neatly. Now some of the party were\\nhurriedly building a snow corral at a safe distance from the camp, to\\nwhich the dogs could be brought for greater convenience in feeding. The\\nspecimens were laid out on the hard snow near the camp, save for one on\\nwhich Lake was making crude attempts at dissection.\\n\\nThis dissection seemed to be a greater task than had been expected,\\nfor, despite the heat of a gasoline stove in the newly raised\\nlaboratory tent, the deceptively flexible tissues of the chosen\\nspecimenâ\\x80\\x94a powerful and intact oneâ\\x80\\x94lost nothing of their more than\\nleathery toughness. Lake was puzzled as to how he might make the\\nrequisite incisions without violence destructive enough to upset all\\nthe structural niceties he was looking for.\\n\\nHe had, it is true, seven more perfect specimens; but these were too\\nfew to use up recklessly unless the cave might later yield an unlimited\\nsupply. Accordingly, he removed the specimen and dragged in one which,\\nthough having remnants of the starfish arrangements at both ends, was\\nbadly crushed and partly disrupted along one of the great torso furrows.\\n\\nResults, quickly reported over the wireless, were baffling and\\nprovocative indeed. Nothing like delicacy or accuracy was possible with\\ninstruments hardly able to cut the anomalous tissue, but the little\\nthat was achieved left us all awed and bewildered.\\n\\nExisting biology would have to be wholly revised, for this thing was no\\nproduct of any cell growth science knows about. There had been scarcely\\nany mineral replacement, and despite an age of perhaps forty million\\nyears the internal organs were wholly intact.\\n\\nThe leathery, undeteriorative, and almost indestructible quality was an\\ninherent attribute of the thing\\'s form of organization, and pertained\\nto some paleocene cycle of invertebrate evolution utterly beyond our\\npowers of speculation.\\n\\nAt first all that Lake found was dry, but as the heated tent produced\\nits thawing effect, organic moisture of pungent and offensive odor\\nwas encountered toward the thing\\'s uninjured side. It was not blood,\\nbut a thick, dark-green fluid apparently answering the same purpose.\\nBy the time Lake reached this stage all thirty-seven dogs had been\\nbrought to the still uncompleted corral near the camp, and even at that\\ndistance set up a savage barking and show of restlessness at the acrid,\\ndiffusive smell.\\n\\nFar from helping to place the strange entity, this provisional\\ndissection merely deepened its mystery. All guesses about its external\\nmembers had been correct, and on the evidence of these one could hardly\\nhesitate to call the thing animal, but internal inspection brought up\\nso many vegetable evidences that Lake was left hopelessly at sea. It\\nhad digestion and circulation, and eliminated waste matter through the\\nreddish tubes of its starfish-shaped base.\\n\\nCursorily, one would say that its respiratory apparatus handled oxygen\\nrather than carbon dioxide; and there were odd evidences of air-storage\\nchambers and methods of shifting respiration from the external orifice\\nto at least two other fully developed breathing systemsâ\\x80\\x94gills and\\npores.\\n\\nClearly, it was amphibian and probably adapted to long airless\\nhibernation periods as well. Vocal organs seemed present in connection\\nwith the main respiratory system, but they presented anomalies beyond\\nimmediate solution. Articulate speech, in the sense of syllable\\nutterance, seemed barely conceivable, but musical piping notes covering\\na wide range were highly probable. The muscular system was almost\\npre-naturally developed.\\n\\nThe nervous system was so complex and highly developed as to leave Lake\\naghast. Though excessively primitive and archaic in some respects, the\\nthing had a set of gangliar centers and connectives arguing the very\\nextremes of specialized development.\\n\\nIts five-lobed brain was surprisingly advanced, and there were signs of\\na sensory equipment, served in part through the wiry cilia of the head,\\ninvolving factors alien to any other terrestrial organism. Probably it\\nhad more than five senses, so that its habits could not be predicted\\nfrom any existing analogy.\\n\\nIt must, Lake thought, have been a creature of keen sensitiveness and\\ndelicately differentiated functions in its primal worldâ\\x80\\x94much like the\\nants and bees of to-day. It reproduced like the vegetable cryptogams,\\nespecially the pteridophyta; having spore cases at the tips of the\\nwings and evidently developing from a thallus or prothallus.\\n\\nBut to give it a name at this stage was mere folly. It looked like a\\nradiate, but was clearly something more. It was partly vegetable, but\\nhad three fourths of the essentials of animal structure. That it was\\nmarine in origin, its symmetrical contour and certain other attributes\\nclearly indicated; yet one could not be exact as to the limit of its\\nlater adaptations.\\n\\nThe wings, after all, held a persistent suggestion of the aÃ«rial.\\nHow it could have undergone its tremendously complex evolution on a\\nnew-born earth in time to leave prints in archÃ¦an rocks was so far\\nbeyond conception as to make Lake whimsically recall the primal myths\\nabout Great Old Ones who filtered down from the stars and concocted\\nearth life as a joke or mistake; and the wild tales of cosmic hill\\nthings from outside told by a folklorist colleague in Miskatonic\\'s\\nEnglish department.\\n\\nNaturally, he considered the possibility of the pre-Cambrian prints\\nhaving been made by a less evolved ancestor of the present specimens,\\nbut quickly rejected this too-facile theory upon considering the\\nadvanced structural qualities of the older fossils. If anything, the\\nlater contours showed decadence rather than higher evolution.\\n\\nThe size of the pseudofeet had decreased, and the whole morphology\\nseemed coarsened and simplified. Moreover, the nerves and organs,\\njust examined, held singular suggestions of retrogression from forms\\nstill more complex. Atrophied and vestigial parts were surprisingly\\nprevalent. Altogether, little could be said to have been solved; and\\nLake fell back on mythology for a provisional nameâ\\x80\\x94jocosely dubbing\\nhis finds \"The Elder Ones.\"\\n\\nAt about two-thirty a.m., having decided to postpone further work and\\nget a little rest, he covered the dissected organism with a tarpaulin,\\nemerged from the laboratory tent, and studied the intact specimens with\\nrenewed interest.\\n\\nThe ceaseless antarctic sun had begun to limber up their tissues a\\ntrifle, so that the head points and tubes of two or three showed\\nsigns of unfolding; but Lake did not believe there was any danger of\\nimmediate decomposition in the almost subzero air. He did, however,\\nmove all the undissected specimens closer together and throw a spare\\ntent over them in order to keep off the direct solar rays. That\\nwould also help to keep their possible scent away from the dogs,\\nwhose hostile unrest was really becoming a problem, even at their\\nsubstantial distance and behind the higher and higher snow walls, which\\nan increased quota of the men were hastening to raise around their\\nquarters.\\n\\nHe had to weight down the corners of the tent cloth with heavy blocks\\nof snow to hold it in place amidst the rising gale, for the titan\\nmountains seemed about to deliver some gravely severe blasts. Early\\napprehensions about sudden antarctic winds were revived, and under\\nAtwood\\'s supervision precautions were taken to bank the tents, new dog\\ncorral, and crude aÃ«roplane shelters with snow, on the mountainward\\nside. These latter shelters, begun with hard snow blocks during odd\\nmoments, were by no means as high as they should have been; and Lake\\nfinally detached all hands from other tasks to work on them.\\n\\nIt was after four when Lake at last prepared to sign off and advised\\nus all to share the rest period his outfit would take when the shelter\\nwalls were a little higher. He held some friendly chat with Pabodie\\nover the ether, and repeated his praise of the really marvelous drills\\nthat had helped him make his discovery. Atwood also sent greetings and\\npraises.\\n\\nI gave Lake a warm word of congratulation, owning up that he was right\\nabout the western trip, and we all agreed to get in touch by wireless\\nat ten in the morning. If the gale was then over, Lake would send a\\nplane for the party at my base. Just before retiring I dispatched a\\nfinal message to the Arkham , with instructions about toning down the\\nday\\'s news for the outside world, since the full details seemed radical\\nenough to rouse a wave of incredulity until further substantiated.\\n\\nIII.\\n\\nNone of us, I imagine, slept very heavily or continuously that morning.\\nBoth the excitement of Lake\\'s discovery and the mounting fury of the\\nwind were against such a thing. So savage was the blast even where we\\nwere, that we could not help wondering how much worse it was at Lake\\'s\\ncamp, directly under the vast unknown peaks that bred and delivered it.\\n\\nMcTighe was awake at ten o\\'clock and tried to get Lake on the wireless,\\nas agreed, but some electrical condition in the disturbed air to the\\nwestward seemed to prevent communication. We did, however, get the Arkham , and Douglas told me that he had likewise been vainly trying\\nto reach Lake. He had not known about the wind, for very little was\\nblowing at McMurdo Sound, despite its persistent rage where we were.\\n\\nThroughout the day we all listened anxiously and tried to get Lake at\\nintervals, but invariably without results. About noon a positive frenzy\\nof wind stampeded out of the west, causing us to fear for the safety of\\nour camp; but it eventually died down, with only a moderate relapse at\\ntwo p.m.\\n\\nAfter three o\\'clock it was very quiet, and we redoubled our efforts to\\nget Lake. Reflecting that he had four planes, each provided with an\\nexcellent short-wave outfit, we could not imagine any ordinary accident\\ncapable of crippling all his wireless equipment at once. Nevertheless,\\nthe stony silence continued, and when we thought of the delirious force\\nthe wind must have had in his locality we could not help making the\\nmost direful conjectures.\\n\\nBy six o\\'clock our fears had become intense and definite, and after a\\nwireless consultation with Douglas and Thorfinnssen I resolved to take\\nsteps toward investigation. The fifth aÃ«roplane, which we had left\\nat the McMurdo Sound supply cache with Sherman and two sailors, was\\nin good shape and ready for instant use, and it seemed that the very\\nemergency for which it had been saved was now upon us.\\n\\nI got Sherman by wireless and ordered him to join me with the plane\\nand the two sailors at the southern base as quickly as possible, the\\nair conditions being apparently highly favorable. We then talked over\\nthe personnel of the coming investigation party, and decided that we\\nwould include all hands, together with the sledge and dogs which I\\nhad kept with me. Even so great a load would not be too much for one\\nof the huge planes built to our special orders for heavy machinery\\ntransportation. At intervals I still tried to reach Lake with the\\nwireless, but all to no purpose.\\n\\nSherman, with the sailors Gunnarsson and Larsen, took off at seven\\nthirty; and reported a quiet flight from several points on the wing.\\nThey arrived at our base at midnight, and all hands at once discussed\\nthe next move. It was risky business sailing over the antarctic in a\\nsingle aÃ«roplane without any line of bases, but no one drew back from\\nwhat seemed like the plainest necessity. We turned in at two o\\'clock\\nfor a brief rest after some preliminary loading of the plane, but were\\nup again in four hours to finish the loading and packing.\\n\\nAt seven fifteen a.m., January 25th, we started northwestward under\\nMcTighe\\'s pilotage with ten men, seven dogs, a sledge, a fuel and food\\nsupply, and other items including the plane\\'s wireless outfit. The\\natmosphere was clear, fairly quiet, and relatively mild in temperature,\\nand we anticipated very little trouble in reaching the latitude and\\nlongitude designated by Lake as the site of his camp. Our apprehensions\\nwere over what we might find, or fail to find, at the end of our\\njourney, for silence continued to answer all calls dispatched to the\\ncamp.\\n\\nEvery incident of that four-and-a-half-hour flight is burned into my\\nrecollection because of its crucial position in my life. It marked my\\nloss, at the age of fifty-four, of all that peace and balance which the\\nnormal mind possesses through its accustomed conception of external\\nnature and nature\\'s laws.\\n\\nThenceforward the ten of usâ\\x80\\x94but the student Danforth and myself\\nabove all othersâ\\x80\\x94were to face a hideously amplified world of lurking\\nhorrors which nothing can erase from our emotions, and which we\\nwould refrain from sharing with mankind in general if we could. The\\nnewspapers have printed the bulletins we sent from the moving plane,\\ntelling of our nonstop course, our two battles with treacherous\\nupper-air gales, our glimpse of the broken surface where Lake had sunk\\nhis mid-journey shaft three days before, and our sight of a group of\\nthose strange fluffy snow cylinders noted by Amundsen and Byrd as\\nrolling in the wind across the endless leagues of frozen plateau.\\n\\nThere came a point, though, when our sensations could not be conveyed\\nin any words the press would understand, and a later point when we had\\nto adopt an actual rule of strict censorship.\\n\\nThe sailor Larsen was first to spy the jagged line of witchlike cones\\nand pinnacles ahead, and his shouts sent every one to the windows of\\nthe great cabined plane. Despite our speed, they were very slow in\\ngaining prominence; hence we knew that they must be infinitely far off,\\nand visible only because of their abnormal height.\\n\\nLittle by little, however, they rose grimly into the western sky,\\nallowing us to distinguish various bare, bleak, blackish summits, and\\nto catch the curious sense of phantasy which they inspired as seen\\nin the reddish antarctic light against the provocative background of\\niridescent ice-dust clouds.\\n\\nIn the whole spectacle there was a persistent, pervasive hint of\\nstupendous secrecy and potential revelation. It was as if these\\nstark, nightmare spires marked the pylons of a frightful gateway into\\nforbidden spheres of dream, and complex gulfs of remote time, space,\\nand ultradimensionality. I could not help feeling that they were evil\\nthingsâ\\x80\\x94mountains of madness whose farther slopes looked out over some\\naccursed ultimate abyss.\\n\\nThat seething, half-luminous cloud background held ineffable\\nsuggestions of a vague, ethereal beyondness far more than terrestrially\\nspatial, and gave appalling reminders of the utter remoteness,\\nseparateness, desolation, and Ã¦on-long death of this untrodden and\\nunfathomed austral world.\\n\\nIt was young Danforth who drew our notice to the curious regularities\\nof the higher mountain sky lineâ\\x80\\x94regularities like clinging fragments\\nof perfect cubes, which Lake had mentioned in his messages, and which\\nindeed justified his comparison with the dreamlike suggestions of\\nprimordial temple ruins, on cloudy Asian mountaintops so subtly and\\nstrangely painted by Roerich.\\n\\nThere was indeed something hauntingly Roerichlike about this whole\\nunearthly continent of mountainous mystery. I had felt it in October\\nwhen we first caught sight of Victoria Land, and I felt it afresh now.\\nI felt, too, another wave of uneasy consciousness of archÃ¦an mythical\\nresemblances, of how disturbingly this lethal realm corresponded to the\\nevilly famed plateau of Leng in the primal writings.\\n\\nMythologists have placed Leng in Central Asia, but the racial memory of\\nmanâ\\x80\\x94or of his predecessorsâ\\x80\\x94is long, and it may well be that certain\\ntales have come down from lands and mountains and temples of horror\\nearlier than Asia and earlier than any human world we know.\\n\\nA few daring mystics have hinted at a pre-Pleistocene origin for the\\nfragmentary Pnakotic Manuscripts, and have suggested that the devotees\\nof Tsathoggua were as alien to mankind as Tsathoggua itself.\\n\\nLeng, wherever in space or time it might brood, was not a region I\\nwould care to be in or near, nor did I relish the proximity of a\\nworld that had ever bred such ambiguous and archÃ¦an monstrosities as\\nthose Lake had just mentioned. At the moment I felt sorry that I had\\never read the abhorred Necronomicon , or talked so much with that\\nunpleasantly erudite folklorist Wilmarth at the university.\\n\\nThis mood undoubtedly served to aggravate my reaction to the bizarre\\nmirage which burst upon us from the increasingly opalescent zenith\\nas we drew near the mountains and began to make out the cumulative\\nundulations of the foothills. I had seen dozens of polar mirages during\\nthe preceding weeks, some of them quite as uncanny and fantastically\\nvivid as the present sample, but this one had a wholly novel and\\nobscure quality of menacing symbolism, and I shuddered as the seething\\nlabyrinth of fabulous walls and towers and minarets loomed out of the\\ntroubled ice vapors above our heads.\\n\\nThe effect was that of a Cyclopean city of no architecture known to\\nman or to human imagination, with vast aggregations of night-black\\nmasonry embodying monstrous perversions of geometrical laws. There\\nwere truncated cones, sometimes terraced or fluted, surmounted by\\ntall cylindrical shafts here and there bulbously enlarged and often\\ncapped with tiers of thinnish scalloped disks, and strange, beetling,\\ntablelike constructions suggesting piles of multitudinous rectangular\\nslabs or circular plates or five-pointed stars with each one\\noverlapping the one beneath.\\n\\nThere were composite cones and pyramids either alone or surmounting\\ncylinders or cubes or flatter truncated cones and pyramids, and\\noccasional needlelike spires in curious clusters of five.\\n\\nAll of these febrile structures seemed knit together by tubular bridges\\ncrossing from one to the other at various dizzy heights, and the\\nimplied scale of the whole was terrifying and oppressive in its sheer\\ngiganticism.\\n\\nThe general type of mirage was not unlike some of the wilder forms\\nobserved and drawn by the arctic whaler Scoresby in 1820, but at\\nthis time and place, with those dark, unknown mountain peaks soaring\\nstupendously ahead, that anomalous elder-world discovery in our minds,\\nand the pall of probable disaster enveloping the greater part of our\\nexpedition, we all seemed to find in it a taint of latent malignity and\\ninfinitely evil portent.\\n\\nI was glad when the mirage began to break up, though in the process\\nthe various nightmare turrets and cones assumed distorted, temporary\\nforms of even vaster hideousness. As the whole illusion dissolved to\\nchurning opalescence, we began to look earthward again, and saw that\\nour journey\\'s end was not far off.\\n\\nThe unknown mountains ahead rose dizzily up like a fearsome rampart of\\ngiants, their curious regularities showing with startling clearness\\neven without a field glass. We were over the lowest foothills now, and\\ncould see amidst the snow, ice, and bare patches of their main plateau\\na couple of darkish spots which we took to be Lake\\'s camp and boring.\\n\\nThe higher foothills shot up between five and six miles away, forming a\\nrange almost distinct from the terrifying line of more than Himalayan\\npeaks beyond them. At length Ropesâ\\x80\\x94the student who had relieved\\nMcTighe at the controlsâ\\x80\\x94began to head downward toward the left-hand\\ndark spot whose size marked it as the camp. As he did so, McTighe sent\\nout the last uncensored wireless message the world was to receive from\\nour expedition.\\n\\nEvery one, of course, has read the brief and unsatisfying bulletins of\\nthe rest of our antarctic sojourn.\\n\\nSome hours after our landing we sent a guarded report of the tragedy we\\nfound, and reluctantly announced the wiping out of the whole Lake party\\nby the frightful wind of the preceding day, or of the night before\\nthat. There were eleven known dead, young Gedney was missing.\\n\\nPeople pardoned our hazy lack of details through realization of the\\nshock the sad event must have caused us, and believed us when we\\nexplained that the mangling action of the wind had rendered all eleven\\nbodies unsuitable for transportation outside.\\n\\nIndeed, I flatter myself that even in the midst of our distress, utter\\nbewilderment, and soul-clutching horror, we scarcely went beyond the\\ntruth in any specific instance. The tremendous significance lies in\\nwhat we dared not tell; what I would not tell now but for the need of\\nwarning others off from nameless terrors.\\n\\nIt is a fact that the wind had wrought dreadful havoc. Whether all\\ncould have lived through it, even without the other thing, is gravely\\nopen to doubt. The storm, with its fury of madly driven ice particles,\\nmust have been beyond anything our expedition had encountered before.\\n\\nOne aÃ«roplane shelterâ\\x80\\x94all, it seems, had been left in a far too flimsy\\nand inadequate stateâ\\x80\\x94was nearly pulverized; and the derrick at the\\ndistant boring was entirely shaken to pieces.\\n\\nThe exposed metal of the grounded planes and drilling machinery was\\nbruised into a high polish, and two of the small tents were flattened\\ndespite their snow banking. Wooden surfaces left out in the blast were\\npitted and denuded of paint, and all signs of tracks in the snow were\\ncompletely obliterated.\\n\\nIt is also true that we found none of the archÃ¦an biological objects in\\na condition to take outside as a whole. We did gather some minerals\\nfrom a vast, tumbled pile, including several of the greenish soapstone\\nfragments whose odd five-pointed rounding and faint patterns of grouped\\ndots caused so many doubtful comparisons, and some fossil bones, among\\nwhich were the most typical of the curiously injured specimens.\\n\\nNone of the dogs survived, their hurriedly built snow inclosure near\\nthe camp being almost wholly destroyed. The wind may have done that,\\nthough the greater breakage, on the side next to the camp, which was\\nnot the windward one, suggests an outward leap or break of the frantic\\nbeasts themselves.\\n\\nAll three sledges were gone, and we have tried to explain that the wind\\nmay have blown them off into the unknown. The drill and ice-melting\\nmachinery at the boring were too badly damaged to warrant salvage, so\\nwe used them to choke up that subtly disturbing gateway to the past\\nwhich Lake had blasted.\\n\\nWe likewise left at the camp the two most shaken up of the planes;\\nsince our surviving party had only four real pilotsâ\\x80\\x94Sherman, Danforth,\\nMcTighe, and Ropesâ\\x80\\x94in all, with Danforth in a poor nervous shape to\\nnavigate. We brought back all the books, scientific equipment, and\\nother incidentals we could find, though much was rather unaccountably\\nblown away. Spare tents and furs were either missing or badly out of\\ncondition.\\n\\nIt was approximately four p.m., after wide plane cruising had forced\\nus to give Gedney up for lost, that we sent our guarded message to the Arkham for relaying; and I think we did well to keep it as calm and\\nnoncommittal as we succeeded in doing.\\n\\nThe most we said about agitation concerned our dogs, whose frantic\\nuneasiness near the biological specimens was to be expected from poor\\nLake\\'s accounts. We did not mention, I think, their display of the\\nsame uneasiness when sniffing around the queer greenish soapstones\\nand certain other objects in the disordered regionâ\\x80\\x94objects including\\nscientific instruments, aÃ«roplanes, and machinery, both at the camp\\nand at the boring, whose parts had been loosened, moved, or otherwise\\ntampered with by winds that must have harbored singular curiosity and\\ninvestigativeness.\\n\\nAbout the fourteen biological specimens we were pardonably indefinite.\\nWe said that the only ones we discovered were damaged, but that enough\\nwas left of them to prove Lake\\'s description wholly and impressively\\naccurate. It was hard work keeping our personal emotions out of this\\nmatterâ\\x80\\x94and we did not mention numbers or say exactly how we had found\\nthose which we did find. We had by that time agreed not to transmit\\nanything suggesting madness on the part of Lake\\'s men, and it surely\\nlooked like madness to find six imperfect monstrosities carefully\\nburied upright in nine-foot snow graves under five-pointed mounds\\npunched over with groups of dots in patterns exactly like those on\\nthe queer greenish soapstones dug up from Mesozoic or Tertiary times.\\nThe eight perfect specimens mentioned by Lake seemed to have been\\ncompletely blown away.\\n\\nWe were careful, too, about the public\\'s general peace of mind; hence\\nDanforth and I said little about that frightful trip over the mountains\\nthe next day. It was the fact that only a radically lightened plane\\ncould possibly cross a range of such height which mercifully limited\\nthat scouting tour to the two of us.\\n\\nOn our return at one a.m., Danforth was close to hysterics, but kept an\\nadmirably stiff upper lip. It took no persuasion to make him promise\\nnot to show our sketches and the other things we brought away in our\\npockets, not to say anything more to the others than what we had agreed\\nto relay outside, and to hide our camera films for private development\\nlater on; so that part of my present story will be as new to Pabodie,\\nMcTighe, Ropes, Sherman, and the rest as it will be to that world in\\ngeneral. Indeedâ\\x80\\x94Danforth is closer mouthed than I: for he saw, or\\nthinks he saw, one thing he will not tell even me.\\n\\nAs all know, our report included a tale of a hard ascentâ\\x80\\x94a\\nconfirmation of Lake\\'s opinion that the great peaks are of archÃ¦an\\nslate and other very primal crumpled strata unchanged since at least\\nmiddle Comanchean time, a conventional comment on the regularity of the\\nclinging cube and rampart formations, a decision that the cave mouths\\nindicate dissolved calcareous veins, a conjecture that certain slopes\\nand passes would permit of the scaling and crossing of the entire range\\nby seasoned mountaineers, and a remark that the mysterious other side\\nholds a lofty and immense superplateau as ancient and unchanging as the\\nmountains themselvesâ\\x80\\x94twenty thousand feet in elevation, with grotesque\\nrock formations protruding through a thin glacial layer and with low\\ngradual foothills between the general plateau surface and the sheer\\nprecipices of the highest peaks.\\n\\nThis body of data is in every respect true so far as it goes, and\\nit completely satisfied the men at the camp. We laid our absence of\\nsixteen hoursâ\\x80\\x94a longer time than our announced flying, landing,\\nreconnoitering, and rock-collecting program called forâ\\x80\\x94to a long\\nmythical spell of adverse wind conditions, and told truly of our\\nlanding on the farther foothills.\\n\\nFortunately our tale sounded realistic and prosaic enough not to tempt\\nany of the others into emulating our flight. Had any tried to do that,\\nI would have used every ounce of my persuasion to stop themâ\\x80\\x94and I do\\nnot know what Danforth would have done.\\n\\nWhile we were gone, Pabodie, Sherman, Ropes, McTighe, and Williamson\\nhad worked like beavers over Lake\\'s two best planes, fitting them\\nagain for use, despite the altogether unaccountable juggling of their\\noperative mechanism.\\n\\nWe decided to load all the planes the next morning and start back for\\nour old base as soon as possible. Even though indirect, that was the\\nsafest way to work toward McMurdo Sound; for a straight-line flight\\nacross the most utterly unknown stretches of the Ã¦on-dead continent\\nwould involve many additional hazards.\\n\\nFurther exploration was hardly feasible in view of our tragic\\ndecimation and the ruin of our drilling machinery. The doubts and\\nhorrors around usâ\\x80\\x94which we did not revealâ\\x80\\x94made us wish only to escape\\nfrom this austral world of desolation and brooding madness as swiftly\\nas we could.\\n\\nAs the public knows, our return to the world was accomplished without\\nfurther disasters. All planes reached the old base on the evening of\\nthe next dayâ\\x80\\x94January 27thâ\\x80\\x94after a swift nonstop flight; and on the\\n28th we made McMurdo Sound in two laps, the one pause being very brief,\\nand occasioned by a faulty rudder, in the furious wind over the ice\\nshelf after we had cleared the great plateau.\\n\\nIn five days more, the Arkham and Miskatonic , with all hands and\\nequipment on board, were shaking clear of the thickening field ice\\nand working up Ross Sea, with the mocking mountains of Victoria Land\\nlooming westward against a troubled antarctic sky and twisting the\\nwind\\'s wails into a wide-ranged musical piping which chilled my soul to\\nthe quick.\\n\\nLess than a fortnight later we left the last hint of polar land behind\\nus and thanked heaven that we were clear of a haunted, accursed realm\\nwhere life and death, space and time, have made black and blasphemous\\nalliances in the unknown epochs since matter first writhed and swam on\\nthe planet\\'s scarce-cooled crust.\\n\\nSince our return we have all constantly worked to discourage antarctic\\nexploration, and have kept certain doubts and guesses to ourselves with\\nsplendid unity and faithfulness. Even young Danforth, with his nervous\\nbreakdown, has not flinched or babbled to his doctors.\\n\\nIndeed, as I have said, there is one thing he thinks he alone saw\\nwhich he will not tell even me, though I think it would help his\\npsychological state if he would consent to do so. It might explain and\\nrelieve much, though perhaps the thing was no more than the delusive\\naftermath of an earlier shock. That is the impression I gather after\\nthose rare, irresponsible moments when he whispers disjointed things to\\nmeâ\\x80\\x94things which he repudiates vehemently as soon as he gets a grip on\\nhimself again.\\n\\nIt will be hard work deterring others from the great white south, and\\nsome of our efforts may directly harm our cause by drawing inquiring\\nnotice. We might have known from the first that human curiosity is\\nundying, and that the results we announced would be enough to spur\\nothers ahead on the same age-long pursuit of the unknown.\\n\\nLake\\'s reports of those biological monstrosities had aroused\\nnaturalists and palÃ¦ontologists to the highest pitch, though we were\\nsensible enough not to show the detached parts we had taken from the\\nactual buried specimens, or our photographs of those specimens as\\nthey were found. We also refrained from showing the more puzzling of\\nthe scarred bones and greenish soapstones; while Danforth and I have\\nclosely guarded the pictures we took or drew on the superplateau across\\nthe range, and the crumpled things we smoothed, studied in terror, and\\nbrought away in our pockets.\\n\\nBut now that Starkweather-Moore party is organizing, and with a\\nthoroughness far beyond anything our outfit attemptedâ\\x80\\x94if not\\ndissuaded, they will get to the innermost nucleus of the antarctic\\nand melt and bore till they bring up that which we know may end the\\nworld. So I must break through all reticences at lastâ\\x80\\x94even about that\\nultimate, nameless thing beyond the mountains of madness.\\n\\nIV.\\n\\nIt is only with vast hesitancy and repugnance that I let my mind go\\nback to Lake\\'s camp and what we really found thereâ\\x80\\x94and to that other\\nthing beyond the awful mountain wall.\\n\\nI have told of the wind-ravaged terrain, the damaged shelters, the\\ndisarranged machinery, the varied uneasiness of our dogs, the missing\\nsledges and other items, the deaths of men and dogs, the absence of\\nGedney, and the six insanely buried biological specimens, strangely\\nsound in texture for all their structural injuries, from a world forty\\nmillion years dead. I do not recall whether I mentioned that upon\\nchecking up the canine bodies we found one dog missing. We did not\\nthink much about that till laterâ\\x80\\x94indeed, only Danforth and I have\\nthought of it at all.\\n\\nThe principal things I have been keeping back relate to the bodies,\\nand to certain subtle points which may or may not lend a hideous and\\nincredible kind of rationale to the apparent chaos.\\n\\nAt the time, I tried to keep the men\\'s minds off those points; for\\nit was so much simplerâ\\x80\\x94so much more normalâ\\x80\\x94to lay everything to an\\noutbreak of madness on the part of some of Lake\\'s party. From the look\\nof things, that demon mountain wind must have been enough to drive\\nany man mad in the midst of this center of all earthly mystery and\\ndesolation.\\n\\nThe crowning abnormality, of course, was the condition of the\\nbodiesâ\\x80\\x94men and dogs alike. They had all been in some terrible kind\\nof conflict, and were torn and mangled in fiendish and altogether\\ninexplicable ways. Death, so far as we could judge, had in each case\\ncome from strangulation or laceration.\\n\\nThe dogs had evidently started the trouble, for the state of their\\nill-built corral bore witness to its forcible breakage from within.\\nIt had been set some distance from the camp because of the hatred of\\nthe animals for those hellish archÃ¦an organisms, but the precaution\\nseemed to have been taken in vain. When left alone in that monstrous\\nwind, behind flimsy walls of insufficient height, they must have\\nstampededâ\\x80\\x94whether from the wind itself, or from some subtle,\\nincreasing odor emitted by the nightmare specimens, one could not say.\\n\\nBut whatever had happened, it was hideous and revolting enough.\\nPerhaps I had better put squeamishness aside and tell the worst at\\nlastâ\\x80\\x94though with a categorical statement of opinion, based on the\\nfirst-hand observations and most rigid deductions of both Danforth and\\nmyself, that the then missing Gedney was in no way responsible for the\\nloathsome horrors we found.\\n\\nI have said that the bodies were frightfully mangled. Now I must\\nadd that some were incised and subtracted from in the most curious,\\ncold-blooded, and inhuman fashion. It was the same with dogs and men.\\nAll the healthier, fatter bodies, quadrupedal or bipedal, had had\\ntheir most solid masses of tissue cut out and removed, as by a careful\\nbutcher; and around them was a strange sprinkling of saltâ\\x80\\x94taken from\\nthe ravaged provision chests on the planesâ\\x80\\x94which conjured up the most\\nhorrible associations.\\n\\nThe thing had occurred in one of the crude aÃ«roplane shelters from\\nwhich the plane had been dragged out, and subsequent winds had effaced\\nall tracks which could have supplied any plausible theory. Scattered\\nbits of clothing, roughly slashed from the human incision subjects,\\nhinted no clues.\\n\\nIt is useless to bring up the half impression of certain faint snow\\nprints in one shielded corner of the ruined inclosureâ\\x80\\x94because that\\nimpression did not concern human prints at all, but was clearly\\nmixed up with all the talk of fossil prints which poor Lake had been\\ngiving throughout the preceding weeks. One had to be careful of one\\'s\\nimagination in the lee of those overshadowing mountains of madness.\\n\\nAs I have indicated, Gedney and one dog turned out to be missing in\\nthe end. When we came on that terrible shelter we had missed two dogs\\nand two men; but the fairly unharmed dissecting tent, which we entered\\nafter investigating the monstrous graves, had something to reveal.\\n\\nIt was not as Lake had left it, for the covered parts of the primal\\nmonstrosity had been removed from the improvised table. Indeed, we had\\nalready realized that one of the six imperfect and insanely buried\\nthings we had foundâ\\x80\\x94the one with the trace of a peculiarly hateful\\nodorâ\\x80\\x94must represent the collected sections of the entity which Lake\\nhad tried to analyze.\\n\\nOn and around that laboratory table were strewn other things, and it\\ndid not take long for us to guess that those things were the carefully,\\nthough oddly and inexpertly dissected parts of one man and one dog. I\\nshall spare the feelings of survivors by omitting mention of the man\\'s\\nidentity.\\n\\nLake\\'s anatomical instruments were missing, but there were evidences\\nof their careful cleansing. The gasoline stove was also gone, though\\naround it we found a curious litter of matches. We buried the human\\nparts beside the other ten men, and the canine parts with the other\\nthirty-five dogs. Concerning the bizarre smudges on the laboratory\\ntable, and on the jumble of roughly handled illustrated books scattered\\nnear it, we were much too bewildered to speculate.\\n\\nThis formed the worst of the camp horror, but other things were\\nequally perplexing. The disappearance of Gedney, the one dog, the\\neight uninjured biological specimens, the three sledges, and certain\\ninstruments, illustrated technical and scientific books, writing\\nmaterials, electric torches and batteries, food and fuel, heating\\napparatus, spare tents, fur suits, and the like, was utterly beyond\\nsane conjecture; as were likewise the spatter-fringed ink blots on\\ncertain pieces of paper, and the evidences of curious alien fumbling\\nand experimentation around the planes and all other mechanical devices\\nboth at the camp and at the boring. The dogs seemed to abhor this oddly\\ndisordered machinery.\\n\\nThen, too, there was the upsetting of the larder, the disappearance\\nof certain staples, and the jarringly comical heap of tin cans pried\\nopen in the most unlikely ways and at the most unlikely places. The\\nprofusion of scattered matches, intact, broken, or spent, formed\\nanother minor enigmaâ\\x80\\x94as did the two or three tent cloths and fur suits\\nwhich we found lying about with peculiar and unorthodox slashings\\nconceivably due to clumsy efforts at unimaginable adaptations.\\n\\nThe maltreatment of the human and canine bodies, and the crazy burial\\nof the damaged archÃ¦an specimens, were all of a piece with this\\napparent disintegrative madness. In view of just such an eventuality\\nas the present one, we carefully photographed all the main evidences\\nof insane disorder at the camp; and shall use the prints to buttress\\nour pleas against the departure of the proposed Starkweather-Moore\\nExpedition.\\n\\nOur first act after finding the bodies in the shelter was to photograph\\nand open the row of insane graves with the five-pointed snow mounds.\\nWe could not help noticing the resemblance of these monstrous mounds,\\nwith their clusters of grouped dots, to poor Lake\\'s descriptions of the\\nstrange greenish soapstones; and when we came on some of the soapstones\\nthemselves in the great mineral pile we found the likeness very close\\nindeed.\\n\\nThe whole general formation, it must be made clear, seemed abominably\\nsuggestive of the starfish head of the archÃ¦an entities; and we agreed\\nthat the suggestion must have worked potently upon the sensitized minds\\nof Lake\\'s overwrought party.\\n\\nFor madnessâ\\x80\\x94centering in Gedney as the only possible surviving\\nagentâ\\x80\\x94was the explanation spontaneously adopted by everybody so far\\nas spoken utterance was concerned; though I will not be so naÃ¯ve as\\nto deny that each of us may have harbored wild guesses which sanity\\nforbade him to formulate completely.\\n\\nSherman, Pabodie, and McTighe made an exhaustive aÃ«roplane cruise over\\nall the surrounding territory in the afternoon, sweeping the horizon\\nwith field glasses in quest of Gedney and of the various missing\\nthings; but nothing came to light.\\n\\nThe party reported that the titan-barrier range extended endlessly to\\nright and left alike, without any diminution in height or essential\\nstructure. On some of the peaks, though, the regular cube and rampart\\nformations were bolder and plainer, having doubly fantastic similitudes\\nto Roerich-painted Asian hill ruins. The distribution of cryptical cave\\nmouths on the black snow-denuded summits seemed roughly even as far as\\nthe range could be traced.\\n\\nIn spite of all the prevailing horrors we were left with enough sheer\\nscientific zeal and adventurousness to wonder about the unknown realm\\nbeyond those mysterious mountains.\\n\\nAs our guarded messages stated, we rested at midnight after our day of\\nterror and bafflementâ\\x80\\x94but not without a tentative plan for one or more\\nrange-crossing altitude flights in a lightened plane with aÃ«rial camera\\nand geologist\\'s outfit, beginning the following morning.\\n\\nIt was decided that Danforth and I try it first, and we awaked at seven\\na.m. intending an early trip; though heavy windsâ\\x80\\x94mentioned in our\\nbrief bulletin to the outside worldâ\\x80\\x94delayed our start till nearly nine\\no\\'clock.\\n\\nI have already repeated the noncommittal story we told the men at\\ncampâ\\x80\\x94and relayed outsideâ\\x80\\x94after our return sixteen hours later.\\nIt is now my terrible duty to amplify this account by filling in\\nthe merciful blanks with hints of what we really saw in that hidden\\ntransmontane worldâ\\x80\\x94hints of the revelations which have finally driven\\nDanforth to a nervous collapse.\\n\\nI wish he would add a really frank word about the thing which he thinks\\nhe alone sawâ\\x80\\x94even though it was probably a nervous delusionâ\\x80\\x94and which\\nwas perhaps the last straw that put him where he is; but he is firm\\nagainst that. All I can do is to repeat his later disjointed whispers\\nabout what set him shrieking as the plane soared back through the\\nwind-tortured mountain pass after that real and tangible shock which I\\nshared.\\n\\nThis will form my last word. If the plain signs of surviving elder\\nhorrors in what I disclose be not enough to keep others from meddling\\nwith the inner antarcticâ\\x80\\x94or at least from prying too deeply beneath\\nthe surface of that ultimate waste of forbidden secrets and unhuman,\\nÃ¦on-cursed desolationâ\\x80\\x94the responsibility for unnamable and perhaps\\nimmeasurable evils will not be mine.\\n\\nDanforth and I, studying the notes made by Pabodie in his afternoon\\nflight and checking up with a sextant, had calculated that the lowest\\navailable pass in the range lay somewhat to the right of us, within\\nsight of camp, and about twenty-three thousand or twenty-four thousand\\nfeet above sea-level. For this point, then, we first headed in the\\nlightened plane as we embarked on our flight of discovery.\\n\\nThe camp itself, on foothills which sprang from a high continental\\nplateau, was some twelve thousand feet in altitude; hence the\\nactual height increase necessary was not so vast as it might seem.\\nNevertheless we were acutely conscious of the rarefied air and intense\\ncold as we rose; for, on account of visibility conditions, we had\\nto leave the cabin windows open. We were dressed, of course, in our\\nheaviest furs.\\n\\nAs we drew near the forbidding peaks, dark and sinister above the\\nline of crevasse-riven snow and interstitial glaciers, we noticed more\\nand more the curiously regular formations clinging to the slopes; and\\nthought again of the strange Asian paintings of Nicholas Roerich.\\n\\nThe ancient and wind-weathered rock strata fully verified all of\\nLake\\'s bulletins, and proved that these pinnacles had been towering\\nup in exactly the same way since a surprisingly early time in earth\\'s\\nhistoryâ\\x80\\x94perhaps over fifty million years. How much higher they had\\nonce been, it was futile to guess; but everything about this strange\\nregion pointed to obscure atmospheric influences unfavorable to\\nchange, and calculated to retard the usual climatic processes of rock\\ndisintegration.\\n\\nBut it was the mountainside tangle of regular cubes, ramparts, and cave\\nmouths which fascinated and disturbed us most. I studied them with a\\nfield glass and took aÃ«rial photographs while Danforth drove; and at\\ntimes I relieved him at the controlsâ\\x80\\x94though my aviation knowledge was\\npurely an amateur\\'sâ\\x80\\x94in order to let him use the binoculars.\\n\\nWe could easily see that much of the material of the things was a\\nlightish archÃ¦an quartzite, unlike any formation visible over broad\\nareas of the general surface; and that their regularity was extreme and\\nuncanny to an extent which poor Lake had scarcely hinted.\\n\\nAs he had said, their edges were crumbled and rounded from untold\\nÃ¦ons of savage weathering; but their preternatural solidity and tough\\nmaterial had saved them from obliteration. Many parts, especially\\nthose closest to the slopes, seemed identical in substance with the\\nsurrounding rock surface.\\n\\nThe whole arrangement looked like the ruins of Macchu Picchu in\\nthe Andes, or the primal foundation walls of Kish as dug up by the\\nOxford-Field Museum Expedition in 1929; and both Danforth and I\\nobtained that occasional impression of separate Cyclopean blocks which\\nLake had attributed to his flight-companion Carroll.\\n\\nHow to account for such things in this place was frankly beyond me, and\\nI felt queerly humbled as a geologist. Igneous formations often have\\nstrange regularitiesâ\\x80\\x94like the famous Giants\\' Causeway in Irelandâ\\x80\\x94but\\nthis stupendous range, despite Lake\\'s original suspicion of smoking\\ncones, was above all else nonvolcanic in evident structure.\\n\\nThe curious cave mouths, near which the odd formation seemed most\\nabundant, presented another, albeit a lesser puzzle because of their\\nregularity of outline. They were, as Lake\\'s bulletin had said, often\\napproximately square or semicircular; as if the natural orifices had\\nbeen shaped to greater symmetry by some magic hand. Their numerousness\\nand wide distribution were remarkable, and suggested that the whole\\nregion was honeycombed with tunnels dissolved out of limestone strata.\\n\\nSuch glimpses as we secured did not extend far within the caverns, but\\nwe saw that they were apparently clear of stalactites and stalagmites.\\nOutside, those parts of the mountain slopes adjoining the apertures\\nseemed invariably smooth and regular; and Danforth thought that the\\nslight cracks and pittings of the weathering tended toward unusual\\npatterns.\\n\\nFilled as he was with the horrors and strangenesses discovered at the\\ncamp, he hinted that the pittings vaguely resembled those baffling\\ngroups of dots sprinkled over the primeval greenish soapstones, so\\nhideously duplicated on the madly conceived snow mounds above those six\\nburied monstrosities.\\n\\nWe had risen gradually in flying over the higher foothills and along\\ntoward the relatively low pass we had selected. As we advanced we\\noccasionally looked down at the snow and ice of the land route,\\nwondering whether we could have attempted the trip with the simpler\\nequipment of earlier days.\\n\\nSomewhat to our surprise we saw that the terrain was far from difficult\\nas such things go; and that despite the crevasses and other bad spots\\nit would not have been likely to deter the sledges of a Scott, a\\nShackleton, or an Amundsen. Some of the glaciers appeared to lead up to\\nwind-bared passes with unusual continuity, and upon reaching our chosen\\npass we found that its case formed no exception.\\n\\nOur sensations of tense expectancy as we prepared to round the crest\\nand peer out over an untrodden world can hardly be described on paper;\\neven though we had no cause to think the regions beyond the range\\nessentially different from those already seen and traversed. The touch\\nof evil mystery in these barrier mountains, and in the beckoning sea of\\nopalescent sky glimpsed betwixt their summits, was a highly subtle and\\nattenuated matter not to be explained in literal words. Rather was it\\nan affair of vague psychological symbolism and Ã¦sthetic associationâ\\x80\\x94a\\nthing mixed up with exotic poetry and paintings, and with archaic myths\\nlurking in shunned and forbidden volumes.\\n\\nEven the wind\\'s burden held a peculiar strain of conscious malignity;\\nand for a second it seemed that the composite sound included a bizarre\\nmusical whistling, or piping over a wide range as the blast swept in\\nand out of the omnipresent and resonant cave mouths. There was a cloudy\\nnote of reminiscent repulsion in this sound, as complex and unplaceable\\nas any of the other dark impressions.\\n\\nWe were now, after a slow ascent, at a height of twenty-three thousand\\nfive hundred and seventy feet according to the aneroid; and had left\\nthe region of clinging snow definitely below us. Up here were only\\ndark, bare rock slopes and the start of rough-ribbed glaciersâ\\x80\\x94but with\\nthose provocative cubes, ramparts, and echoing cave mouths to add a\\nportent of the unnatural, the fantastic, and the dreamlike.\\n\\nLooking along the line of high peaks, I thought I could see the one\\nmentioned by poor Lake, with a rampart exactly on top. It seemed to be\\nhalf lost in a queer antarctic hazeâ\\x80\\x94such a haze, perhaps, as had been\\nresponsible for Lake\\'s early notion of volcanism.\\n\\nThe pass loomed directly before us, smooth and windswept between its\\njagged and malignly frowning pylons. Beyond it was a sky fretted with\\nswirling vapors and lighted by the low polar sunâ\\x80\\x94the sky of that\\nmysterious farther realm upon which we felt no human eye had ever gazed.\\n\\nA few more feet of altitude and we would behold that realm. Danforth\\nand I, unable to speak except in shouts amidst the howling, piping wind\\nthat raced through the pass and added to the noise of the unmuffled\\nengines, exchanged eloquent glances. And then, having gained those last\\nfew feet, we did indeed stare across the momentous divide and over the\\nunsampled secrets of an elder and utterly alien earth.\\n\\nV.\\n\\nI think that both of us simultaneously cried out in mixed awe, wonder,\\nterror, and disbelief in our own senses as we finally cleared the pass\\nand saw what lay beyond. Of course, we must have had some natural\\ntheory in the back of our heads to steady our faculties for the moment.\\nProbably we thought of such things as the grotesquely weathered stones\\nof the Garden of the Gods in Colorado, or the fantastically symmetrical\\nwind-carved rocks of the Arizona desert. Perhaps we even half thought\\nthe sight a mirage like that we had seen the morning before on first\\napproaching those mountains of madness.\\n\\nWe must have had some such normal notions to fall back upon as our\\neyes swept that limitless, tempest-scarred plateau and grasped the\\nalmost endless labyrinth of colossal, regular, and geometrically\\neurythmic stone masses which reared their crumbled and pitted crests\\nabove a glacial sheet not more than forty or fifty feet deep at its\\nthickest, and in places obviously thinner.\\n\\nThe effect of the monstrous sight was indescribable, for some fiendish\\nviolation of known natural law seemed certain at the outset. Here,\\non a hellishly ancient table-land fully twenty thousand feet high,\\nand in a climate deadly to habitation since a prehuman age not less\\nthan five hundred thousand years ago, there stretched nearly to the\\nvision\\'s limit a tangle of orderly stone which only the desperation of\\nmental self-defense could possibly attribute to any but a conscious and\\nartificial cause.\\n\\nThe effect of the monstrous sight was indescribable! Some fiendish violation of natural law!\\n\\nWe had previously dismissed, so far as serious thought was concerned,\\nany theory that the cubes and ramparts of the mountainsides were other\\nthan natural in origin. How could they be otherwise, when man himself\\ncould scarcely have been differentiated from the great apes at the time\\nwhen this region succumbed to the present unbroken reign of glacial\\ndeath?\\n\\nYet now the sway of reason seemed irrefutably shaken, for this\\nCyclopean maze of squared, curved, and angled blocks had features which\\ncut off all comfortable refuge. It was, very clearly, the blasphemous\\ncity of the mirage in stark, objective, and ineluctable reality. That\\ndamnable portent had had a material basis after allâ\\x80\\x94there had been\\nsome horizontal stratum of ice dust in the upper air, and this shocking\\nstone survival had projected its image across the mountains according\\nto the simple laws of reflection. Of course, the phantom had been\\ntwisted and exaggerated, and had contained things which the real source\\ndid not contain; yet now, as we saw that real source, we thought it\\neven more hideous and menacing than its distant image.\\n\\nIt was, very clearly, the blasphemous city of the mirageâ\\x80\\x94in stark, objective reality!\\n\\nOnly the incredible, unhuman massiveness of these vast stone towers\\nand ramparts had saved the frightful thing from utter annihilation in\\nthe hundreds of thousandsâ\\x80\\x94perhaps millionsâ\\x80\\x94of years it had brooded\\nthere amidst the blasts of a bleak upland. \"Corona Mundiâ\\x80\\x94Roof of the\\nWorldâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94\" All sorts of fantastic phrases sprang to our lips as we\\nlooked dizzily down at the unbelievable spectacle.\\n\\nI thought again of the eldritch primal myths that had so persistently\\nhaunted me since my first sight of this dead antarctic worldâ\\x80\\x94of\\nthe demonic plateau of Leng, of the Mi-Go, or Abominable Snow Men\\nof the Himalayas, of the Pnakotic Manuscripts with their prehuman\\nimplications, of the Cthulhu cult, of the Necronomicon , and of the\\nHyperborean legends of formless Tsathoggua and the worse than formless\\nstar spawn associated with that semientity.\\n\\nFor boundless miles in every direction the thing stretched off with\\nvery little thinning; indeed, as our eyes followed it to the right and\\nleft along the base of the low, gradual foothills which separated it\\nfrom the actual mountain rim, we decided that we could see no thinning\\nat all except for an interruption at the left of the pass through\\nwhich we had come. We had merely struck, at random, a limited part of\\nsomething of incalculable extent.\\n\\nThe foothills were more sparsely sprinkled with grotesque stone\\nstructures, linking the terrible city to the already familiar cubes and\\nramparts which evidently formed its mountain outposts. These latter,\\nas well as the queer cave mouths, were as thick on the inner as on the\\nouter sides of the mountains.\\n\\nThe nameless stone labyrinth consisted, for the most part, of\\nwalls from ten to one hundred and fifty feet in ice-clear height,\\nand of a thickness varying from five to ten feet. It was composed\\nmostly of prodigious blocks of dark primordial slate, schist, and\\nsandstoneâ\\x80\\x94blocks in many cases as large as 4 Ã\\x97 6 Ã\\x97 8 feetâ\\x80\\x94though in\\nseveral places it seemed to be carved out of a solid, uneven bed rock\\nof pre-Cambrian slate.\\n\\nThe buildings were far from equal in size, there being innumerable\\nhoneycomb arrangements of enormous extent as well as smaller separate\\nstructures.\\n\\nThe general shape of these things tended to be conical, pyramidal, or\\nterraced; though there were many perfect cylinders, perfect cubes,\\nclusters of cubes, and other rectangular forms, and a peculiar\\nsprinkling of angled edifices whose five-pointed ground plan roughly\\nsuggested modern fortifications. The builders had made constant and\\nexpert use of the principle of the arch, and domes had probably existed\\nin the city\\'s heyday.\\n\\nThe whole tangle was monstrously weathered, and the glacial surface\\nfrom where the towers projected was strewn with fallen blocks and\\nimmemorial dÃ©bris. Where the glaciation was transparent we could see\\nthe lower parts of the gigantic piles, and we noticed the ice-preserved\\nstone bridges which connected the different towers at varying distances\\nabove the ground. On the exposed walls we could detect the scarred\\nplaces where other and higher bridges of the same sort had existed.\\n\\nCloser inspection revealed countless largish windows; some of which\\nwere closed with shutters of a petrified material originally wood,\\nthough most gaped open in a sinister and menacing fashion.\\n\\nMany of the ruins, of course, were roofless, and with uneven though\\nwind-rounded upper edges; whilst others, of a more sharply conical or\\npyramidal model or else protected by higher surrounding structures,\\npreserved intact outlines despite the omnipresent crumbling and\\npitting. With the field glass we could barely make out what seemed to\\nbe sculptural decorations in horizontal bandsâ\\x80\\x94decorations including\\nthose curious groups of dots whose presence on the ancient soapstones\\nnow assumed a vastly larger significance.\\n\\nIn many places the buildings were totally ruined and the ice sheet\\ndeeply riven from various geologic causes. In other places the\\nstonework was worn down to the very level of the glaciation. One\\nbroad swath, extending from the plateau\\'s interior to a cleft in the\\nfoothills about a mile to the left of the pass we had traversed, was\\nwholly free from buildings. It probably represented, we concluded,\\nthe course of some great river which in Tertiary timesâ\\x80\\x94millions\\nof years agoâ\\x80\\x94had poured through the city and into some prodigious\\nsubterranean abyss of the great barrier range. Certainly, this was\\nabove all a region of caves, gulfs, and underground secrets beyond\\nhuman penetration.\\n\\nLooking back to our sensations, and recalling our dazedness at viewing\\nthis monstrous survival from Ã¦ons we had thought prehuman, I can only\\nwonder that we preserved the semblance of equilibrium which we did.\\nOf course, we knew that somethingâ\\x80\\x94chronology, scientific theory, or\\nour own consciousnessâ\\x80\\x94was woefully awry; yet we kept enough poise to\\nguide the plane, observe many things quite minutely, and take a careful\\nseries of photographs which may yet serve both us and the world in good\\nstead.\\n\\nIn my case, ingrained scientific habit may have helped; for above all\\nmy bewilderment and sense of menace there burned a dominant curiosity\\nto fathom more of this age-old secretâ\\x80\\x94to know what sort of beings\\nhad built and lived in this incalculably gigantic place, and what\\nrelation to the general world of its time or of other times so unique a\\nconcentration of life could have had.\\n\\nFor this place could be no ordinary city. It must have formed the\\nprimary nucleus and center of some archaic and unbelievable chapter of\\nearth\\'s history whose outward ramifications, recalled only dimly in the\\nmost obscure and distorted myths, had vanished utterly amidst the chaos\\nof terrene convulsions long before any human race we know had shambled\\nout of apedom.\\n\\nHere sprawled a PalÃ¦ogÃ¦an megalopolis compared with which the fabled\\nAtlantis and Lemuria, Commoriom and Uzuldaroum, and OlathoÃ« in the\\nland of Lomar are recent things of to-dayâ\\x80\\x94not even of yesterday;\\na megalopolis ranking with such whispered prehuman blasphemies as\\nValusia, R\\'lyeh, Ib in the land of Mnar, and the Nameless City of\\nArabia Deserta.\\n\\nAs we flew above that tangle of stark Titan towers my imagination\\nsometimes escaped all bounds and roved aimlessly in realms of fantastic\\nassociationsâ\\x80\\x94even weaving links betwixt this lost world and some of my\\nown wildest dreams concerning the mad horror at the camp.\\n\\nThe plane\\'s fuel tank, in the interest of greater lightness, had\\nbeen only partly filled; hence we now had to exert caution in our\\nexplorations. Even so, however, we covered an enormous extent of\\ngroundâ\\x80\\x94or rather, airâ\\x80\\x94after swooping down to a level where the wind\\nbecame virtually negligible.\\n\\nThere seemed to be no limit to the mountain range, or to the length\\nof the frightful stone city which bordered its inner foothills. Fifty\\nmiles of flight in each direction showed no major change in the\\nlabyrinth of rock and masonry that clawed up corpselike through the\\neternal ice.\\n\\nThere were, though, some highly absorbing diversifications; such as\\nthe carvings on the canyon where that broad river had once pierced the\\nfoothills and approached its sinking place in the great range.\\n\\nThe headlands at the stream\\'s entrance had been boldly carved into\\nCyclopean pylons; and something about the ridgy, barrel-shaped designs\\nstirred up oddly vague, hateful, and confusing semiremembrances in both\\nDanforth and me.\\n\\nWe also came upon several star-shaped open spaces, evidently public\\nsquares, and noted various undulations in the terrain. Where a sharp\\nhill rose, it was generally hollowed out into some sort of rambling\\nstone edifice; but there were at least two exceptions. Of these latter,\\none was too badly weathered to disclose what had been on the jutting\\neminence, while the other still bore a fantastic conical monument\\ncarved out of the solid rock and roughly resembling such things as the\\nwell-known Snake Tomb in the ancient valley of Petra.\\n\\nFlying inland from the mountains, we discovered that the city was\\nnot of infinite width, even though its length along the foothills\\nseemed endless. After about thirty miles the grotesque stone buildings\\nbegan to thin out, and in ten more miles we came to an unbroken waste\\nvirtually without signs of sentient artifice. The course of the river\\nbeyond the city seemed marked by a broad, depressed line, while the\\nland assumed a somewhat greater ruggedness, seeming to slope slightly\\nupward as it receded in the mist-hazed west.\\n\\nSo far we had made no landing, yet to leave the plateau without an\\nattempt at entering some of the monstrous structures would have been\\ninconceivable. Accordingly, we decided to find a smooth place on the\\nfoothills near our navigable pass, there grounding the plane and\\npreparing to do some exploration on foot.\\n\\nThough these gradual slopes were partly covered with a scattering of\\nruins, low flying soon disclosed an ample number of possible landing\\nplaces. Selecting that nearest to the pass, since our next flight would\\nbe across the great range and back to camp, we succeeded about twelve\\nthirty p.m. in coming down on a smooth, hard snow field wholly devoid\\nof obstacles and well adapted to a swift and favorable take-off later\\non.\\n\\nIt did not seem necessary to protect the plane with a snow banking for\\nso brief a time and in so comfortable an absence of high winds at this\\nlevel; hence we merely saw that the landing skis were safely lodged,\\nand that the vital parts of the mechanism were guarded against the cold.\\n\\nFor our foot journey we discarded the heaviest of our flying furs, and\\ntook with us a small outfit consisting of pocket compass, hand camera,\\nlight provisions, voluminous notebooks and paper, geologist\\'s hammer\\nand chisel, specimen bags, coil of climbing rope, and powerful electric\\ntorches with extra batteries; this equipment having been carried in the\\nplane on the chance that we might be able to effect a landing, take\\nground pictures, make drawings and topographical sketches, and obtain\\nrock specimens from some bare slope, outcropping, or mountain cave.\\n\\nFortunately, we had a supply of extra paper to tear up, place in a\\nspare specimen bag, and use on the ancient principle of hare and hounds\\nfor marking our course in any interior mazes we might be able to\\npenetrate. This had been brought in case we found some cave system with\\nair quiet enough to allow such a rapid and easy method in place of the\\nusual rock-chipping method of trail blazing.\\n\\nWalking cautiously downhill over the crusted snow, toward the\\nstupendous stone labyrinth that loomed against the opalescent west,\\nwe felt almost as keen a sense of imminent marvels as we had felt on\\napproaching the unfathomed mountain pass four hours previously.\\n\\nTrue, we had become visually familiar with the incredible secret\\nconcealed by the barrier peaks; yet the prospect of actually entering\\nprimordial walls reared by conscious beings perhaps millions of years\\nagoâ\\x80\\x94before any known race of men could have existedâ\\x80\\x94was none the\\nless awesome and potentially terrible in its implications of cosmic\\nabnormality.\\n\\nThough the thinness of the air at this prodigious altitude made\\nexertion somewhat more difficult than usual, both Danforth and I found\\nourselves bearing up very well, and felt equal to almost any task which\\nmight fall to our lot.\\n\\nIt took only a few steps to bring us to a shapeless ruin worn level\\nwith the snow, while ten or fifteen rods farther on there was a huge,\\nroofless rampart still complete in its gigantic five-pointed outline,\\nand rising to an irregular height of ten or eleven feet. For this\\nlatter we headed; and when at last we were actually able to touch\\nits weathered Cyclopean blocks, we felt that we had established an\\nunprecedented and almost blasphemous link with forgotten Ã¦ons normally\\nclosed to our species.\\n\\nThis rampart, shaped like a star and perhaps three hundred feet from\\npoint to point, was built of Jurassic sandstone blocks of irregular\\nsize, averaging 6 x 8 feet in surface. There was a row of arched\\nloopholes or windows about four feet wide and five feet high, spaced\\nquite symmetrically along the points of the star and at its inner\\nangles, and with the bottoms about four feet from the glaciated surface.\\n\\nLooking through these, we could see that the masonry was fully five\\nfeet thick, that there were no partitions remaining within, and that\\nthere were traces of banded carvings or bas-reliefs on the interior\\nwallsâ\\x80\\x94facts we had indeed guessed before, when flying low over this\\nrampart and others like it. Though lower parts must have originally\\nexisted, all traces of such things were now wholly obscured by the deep\\nlayer of ice and snow at this point.\\n\\nWe crawled through one of the windows and vainly tried to decipher\\nthe nearly effaced mural designs, but did not attempt to disturb\\nthe glaciated floor. Our orientation flights had indicated that many\\nbuildings in the city proper were less ice-choked, and that we might\\nperhaps find wholly clear interiors leading down to the true ground\\nlevel if we entered those structures still roofed at the top.\\n\\nBefore we left the rampart we photographed it carefully, and studied\\nits mortarless Cyclopean masonry with complete bewilderment. We wished\\nthat Pabodie were present, for his engineering knowledge might have\\nhelped us guess how such titanic blocks could have been handled in that\\nunbelievably remote age when the city and its outskirts were built up.\\n\\nThe half-mile walk downhill to the actual city, with the upper wind\\nshrieking vainly and savagely through the skyward peaks in the\\nbackground, was something of which the smallest details will always\\nremain engraved on my mind. Only in fantastic nightmares could any\\nhuman beings but Danforth and me conceive such optical effects.\\n\\nBetween us and the churning vapors of the west lay that monstrous\\ntangle of dark stone towers, its outrÃ© and incredible forms impressing\\nus afresh at every new angle of vision. It was a mirage in solid stone,\\nand were it not for the photographs I would still doubt that such a\\nthing could be. The general type of masonry was identical with that\\nof the rampart we had examined; but the extravagant shapes which this\\nmasonry took in its urban manifestations were past all description.\\n\\nEven the pictures illustrate only one or two phases of its endless\\nvariety, preternatural massiveness, and utterly alien exoticism. There\\nwere geometrical forms for which an Euclid could scarcely find a\\nnameâ\\x80\\x94cones of all degrees of irregularity and truncation, terraces\\nof every sort of provocative disproportion, shafts with odd bulbous\\nenlargements, broken columns in curious groups, and five-pointed or\\nfive-ridged arrangements of mad grotesqueness.\\n\\nAs we drew nearer we could see beneath certain transparent parts of the\\nice sheet, and detect some of the tubular stone bridges that connected\\nthe crazily sprinkled structures at various heights. Of orderly streets\\nthere seemed to be none, the only broad open swath being a mile to the\\nleft, where the ancient river had doubtless flowed through the town\\ninto the mountains.\\n\\nOur field glasses showed the external, horizontal bands of nearly\\neffaced sculptures and dot groups to be very prevalent, and we could\\nhalf imagine what the city must once have looked likeâ\\x80\\x94even though most\\nof the roofs and tower tops had necessarily perished.\\n\\nAs a whole, it had been a complex tangle of twisted lanes and alleys,\\nall of them deep canyons, and some little better than tunnels because\\nof the overhanging masonry or overarching bridges.\\n\\nNow, outspread below us, it loomed like a dream phantasy against a\\nwestward mist through whose northern end the low, reddish antarctic sun\\nof early afternoon was struggling to shine; and when, for a moment,\\nthat sun encountered a denser obstruction and plunged the scene into\\ntemporary shadow, the effect was subtly menacing in a way I can never\\nhope to depict. Even the faint howling and piping of the unfelt wind in\\nthe great mountain passes behind us took on a wilder note of purposeful\\nmalignity.\\n\\nThe last stage of our descent to the town was unusually steep and\\nabrupt, and a rock outcropping at the edge where the grade changed led\\nus to think that an artificial terrace had once existed there. Under\\nthe glaciation, we believed, there must be a flight of steps or its\\nequivalent.\\n\\nWhen at last we plunged into the town itself, clambering over fallen\\nmasonry and shrinking from the oppressive nearness and dwarfing height\\nof omnipresent crumbling and pitted walls, our sensations again became\\nsuch that I marvel at the amount of self-control we retained.\\n\\nDanforth was frankly jumpy, and began making some offensively\\nirrelevant speculations about the horror at the campâ\\x80\\x94which I resented\\nall the more because I could not help sharing certain conclusions\\nforced upon us by many features of this morbid survival from nightmare\\nantiquity.\\n\\nThe speculations worked on his imagination, too; for in one\\nplaceâ\\x80\\x94where a dÃ©bris-littered alley turned a sharp cornerâ\\x80\\x94he insisted\\nthat he saw faint traces of ground markings which he did not like;\\nwhilst elsewhere he stopped to listen to a subtle, imaginary sound\\nfrom some undefined pointâ\\x80\\x94a muffled musical piping, he said, not\\nunlike that of the wind in the mountain caves, yet somehow disturbingly\\ndifferent.\\n\\nThe ceaseless five-pointedness of the surrounding architecture and\\nof the few distinguishable mural arabesques had a dimly sinister\\nsuggestiveness we could not escape, and gave us a touch of terrible\\nsubconscious certainty concerning the primal entities which had reared\\nand dwelt in this unhallowed place.\\n\\nNevertheless, our scientific and adventurous souls were not wholly\\ndead, and we mechanically carried out our program of chipping specimens\\nfrom all the different rock types represented in the masonry. We wished\\na rather full set in order to draw better conclusions regarding the age\\nof the place.\\n\\nNothing in the great outer walls seemed to date from later than the\\nJurassic and Comanchean periods, nor was any piece of stone in the\\nentire place of a greater recency than the Pliocene age. In stark\\ncertainty, we were wandering amidst a death which had reigned at least\\nfive hundred thousand years, and in all probability even longer.\\n\\nAs we proceeded through this maze of stone-shadowed twilight we stopped\\nat all available apertures to study interiors and investigate entrance\\npossibilities. Some were above our reach, whilst others led only into\\nice-choked ruins as unroofed and barren as the rampart on the hill.\\n\\nOne, though spacious and inviting, opened on a seemingly bottomless\\nabyss without visible means of descent. Now and then we had a chance to\\nstudy the petrified wood of a surviving shutter, and were impressed by\\nthe fabulous antiquity implied in the still discernible grain. These\\nthings had come from Mesozoic gymnosperms and conifersâ\\x80\\x94especially\\nCretaceous cycadsâ\\x80\\x94and from fan palms and early angiosperms of plainly\\nTertiary date. Nothing definitely later than the Pliocene could be\\ndiscovered.\\n\\nIn the placing of these shuttersâ\\x80\\x94whose edges showed the former\\npresence of queer and long-vanished hingesâ\\x80\\x94usage seemed to be\\nvariedâ\\x80\\x94some being on the outer and some on the inner side of the\\ndeep embrasures. They seemed to have become wedged in place, thus\\nsurviving the rusting of their former and probably metallic fixtures\\nand fastenings.\\n\\nAfter a time we came across a row of windowsâ\\x80\\x94in the bulges of a\\ncolossal five-edged cone of undamaged apexâ\\x80\\x94which led into a vast,\\nwell-preserved room with stone flooring; but these were too high in\\nthe room to permit descent without a rope. We had a rope with us,\\nbut did not wish to bother with this twenty-foot drop unless obliged\\ntoâ\\x80\\x94especially in this thin plateau air where great demands were made\\nupon the heart action.\\n\\nThis enormous room was probably a hall or concourse of some sort, and\\nour electric torches showed bold, distinct, and potentially startling\\nsculptures arranged round the walls in broad, horizontal bands\\nseparated by equally broad strips of conventional arabesques. We took\\ncareful note of this spot, planning to enter here unless a more easily\\ngained interior was encountered.\\n\\nFinally, though, we did encounter exactly the opening we wished; an\\narchway about six feet wide and ten feet high, marking the former end\\nof an aÃ«rial bridge which had spanned an alley about five feet above\\nthe present level of glaciation. These archways, of course, were flush\\nwith upper-story floors, and in this case one of the floors still\\nexisted.\\n\\nThe building thus accessible was a series of rectangular terraces\\non our left facing westward. That across the alley, where the other\\narchway yawned, was a decrepit cylinder with no windows and with\\na curious bulge about ten feet above the aperture. It was totally\\ndark inside, and the archway seemed to open on a well of illimitable\\nemptiness.\\n\\nHeaped dÃ©bris made the entrance to the vast left-hand building doubly\\neasy, yet for a moment we hesitated before taking advantage of the\\nlong-wished chance. For though we had penetrated into this tangle of\\narchaic mystery, it required fresh resolution to carry us actually\\ninside a complete and surviving building of a fabulous elder world\\nwhose nature was becoming more and more hideously plain to us.\\n\\nIn the end, however, we made the plunge, and scrambled up over the\\nrubble into the gaping embrasure. The floor beyond was of great slate\\nslabs, and seemed to form the outlet of a long, high corridor with\\nsculptured walls.\\n\\nObserving the many inner archways which led off from it, and realizing\\nthe probable complexity of the nest of apartments within, we decided\\nthat we must begin our system of hare-and-hound trail blazing. Hitherto\\nour compasses, together with frequent glimpses of the vast mountain\\nrange between the towers in our rear, had been enough to prevent our\\nlosing our way; but from now on, the artificial substitute would be\\nnecessary.\\n\\nAccordingly we reduced our extra paper to shreds of suitable size,\\nplaced these in a bag to be carried by Danforth, and prepared to use\\nthem as economically as safety would allow. This method would probably\\ngain us immunity from straying, since there did not appear to be any\\nstrong air currents inside the primordial masonry. If such should\\ndevelop, or if our paper supply should give out, we could of course\\nfall back on the more secure though more tedious and retarding method\\nof rock chipping.\\n\\nJust how extensive a territory we had opened up, it was impossible\\nto guess without a trial. The close and frequent connection of the\\ndifferent buildings made it likely that we might cross from one to\\nanother on bridges underneath the ice, except where impeded by local\\ncollapses and geologic rifts, for very little glaciation seemed to have\\nentered the massive constructions.\\n\\nAlmost all the areas of transparent ice had revealed the submerged\\nwindows as tightly shuttered, as if the town had been left in that\\nuniform state until the glacial sheet came to crystallize the lower\\npart for all succeeding time. Indeed, one gained a curious impression\\nthat this place had been deliberately closed and deserted in some dim,\\nbygone Ã¦on, rather than overwhelmed by any sudden calamity or even\\ngradual decay. Had the coming of the ice been foreseen, and had a\\nnameless population left en masse to seek a less doomed abode?\\n\\nThe precise physiographic conditions attending the formation of the\\nice sheet at this point would have to wait for later solution. It had\\nnot, very plainly, been a grinding drive. Perhaps the pressure of\\naccumulated snows had been responsible, and perhaps some flood from\\nthe river, or from the bursting of some ancient glacial dam in the\\ngreat range, had helped to create the special state now observable.\\nImagination could conceive almost anything in connection with this\\nplace.\\n\\nVI.\\n\\nIt would be cumbrous to give a detailed, consecutive account of\\nour wanderings inside that cavernous, Ã¦on-dead honeycomb of primal\\nmasonryâ\\x80\\x94that monstrous lair of elder secrets which now echoed for the\\nfirst time, after uncounted epochs, to the tread of human feet.\\n\\nThis is especially true because so much of the horrible drama and\\nrevelation came from a mere study of the omnipresent mural carvings.\\nOur flash-light photographs of those carvings will do much toward\\nproving the truth of what we are now disclosing, and it is lamentable\\nthat we had not a larger film supply with us. As it was, we made crude\\nnotebook sketches of certain salient features after all our films were\\nused up.\\n\\nThe building which we had entered was one of great size and\\nelaborateness, and gave us an impressive notion of the architecture of\\nthat nameless geologic past. The inner partitions were less massive\\nthan the outer walls, but on the lower levels were excellently\\npreserved. Labyrinthine complexity, involving curiously irregular\\ndifferences in floor levels, characterized the entire arrangement; and\\nwe should certainly have been lost at the very outset but for the trail\\nof torn paper left behind us.\\n\\nWe decided to explore the more decrepit upper parts first of all, hence\\nclimbed aloft in the maze for a distance of some one hundred feet, to\\nwhere the topmost tier of chambers yawned snowily and ruinously open to\\nthe polar sky. Ascent was effected over the steep, transversely ribbed\\nstone ramps or inclined planes which everywhere served in lieu of\\nstairs.\\n\\nThe rooms we encountered were of all imaginable shapes and proportions,\\nranging from five-pointed stars to triangles and perfect cubes. It\\nmight be safe to say that their general average was about 30 x 30 feet\\nin floor area, and twenty feet in height, though many larger apartments\\nexisted.\\n\\nAfter thoroughly examining the upper regions and the glacial level\\nwe descended, story by story, into the submerged part, where indeed\\nwe soon saw we were in a continuous maze of connected chambers and\\npassages probably leading over unlimited areas outside this particular\\nbuilding.\\n\\nThe Cyclopean massiveness and giganticism of everything about us became\\ncuriously oppressive; and there was something vaguely but deeply\\nunhuman in all the contours, dimensions, proportions, decorations, and\\nconstructional nuances of the blasphemously archaic stonework. We soon\\nrealized, from what the carvings revealed, that this monstrous city was\\nmany million years old.\\n\\nWe cannot yet explain the engineering principles used in the anomalous\\nbalancing and adjustment of the vast rock masses, though the function\\nof the arch was clearly much relied on. The rooms we visited were\\nwholly bare of all portable contents, a circumstance which sustained\\nour belief in the city\\'s deliberate desertion. The prime decorative\\nfeature was the almost universal system of mural sculpture, which\\ntended to run in continuous horizontal bands three feet wide and\\narranged from floor to ceiling in alternation with bands of equal width\\ngiven over to geometrical arabesques.\\n\\nThere were exceptions to this rule of arrangement, but its\\npreponderance was overwhelming. Often, however, a series of smooth\\ncartouches containing oddly patterned groups of dots would be sunk\\nalong one of the arabesque bands.\\n\\nThe technique, we soon saw, was mature, accomplished, and Ã¦sthetically\\nevolved to the highest degree of civilized mastery, though utterly\\nalien in every detail to any known art tradition of the human race.\\nIn delicacy of execution no sculpture I have ever seen could approach\\nit. The minutest details of elaborate vegetation, or of animal life,\\nwere rendered with astonishing vividness despite the bold scale of the\\ncarvings; whilst the conventional designs were marvels of skillful\\nintricacy.\\n\\nThe arabesques displayed a profound use of mathematical principles, and\\nwere made up of obscurely symmetrical curves and angles based on the\\nquantity of five.\\n\\nThe pictorial bands followed a highly formalized tradition, and\\ninvolved a peculiar treatment of perspective, but had an artistic force\\nthat moved us profoundly notwithstanding the intervening gulf of vast\\ngeologic periods.\\n\\nTheir method of design hinged on a singular juxtaposition of the cross\\nsection with the two-dimensional silhouette, and embodied an analytical\\npsychology beyond that of any known race of antiquity. It is useless to\\ntry to compare this art with any represented in our museums. Those who\\nsee our photographs will probably find its closest analogue in certain\\ngrotesque conceptions of the most daring futurists.\\n\\nThe arabesque tracery consisted altogether of depressed lines, whose\\ndepth on unweathered walls varied from one to two inches. When\\ncartouches with dot groups appearedâ\\x80\\x94evidently as inscriptions in some\\nunknown and primordial language and alphabetâ\\x80\\x94the depression of the\\nsmooth surface was perhaps an inch and a half, and of the dots perhaps\\na half inch more. The pictorial bands were in countersunk low relief,\\ntheir background being depressed about two inches from the original\\nwall surface.\\n\\nIn some specimens marks of a former coloration could be detected,\\nthough for the most part the untold Ã¦ons had disintegrated and banished\\nany pigments which may have been applied. The more one studied the\\nmarvelous technique the more one admired the things. Beneath their\\nstrict conventionalization one could grasp the minute and accurate\\nobservation and graphic skill of the artists; and indeed, the very\\nconventions themselves served to symbolize and accentuate the real\\nessence or vital differentiation of every object delineated.\\n\\nWe felt, too, that besides these recognizable excellences there\\nwere others lurking beyond the reach of our perceptions. Certain\\ntouches here and there gave vague hints of latent symbols and stimuli\\nwhich another mental and emotional background, and a fuller or\\ndifferent sensory equipment, might have made of profound and poignant\\nsignificance to us.\\n\\nThe subject matter of the sculptures obviously came from the life of\\nthe vanished epoch of their creation, and contained a large proportion\\nof evident history. It is this abnormal historic-mindedness of the\\nprimal raceâ\\x80\\x94a chance circumstance operating, through coincidence,\\nmiraculously in our favorâ\\x80\\x94which made the carvings so awesomely\\ninformative to us, and which caused us to place their photography and\\ntranscription above all other considerations.\\n\\nIn certain rooms the dominant arrangement was varied by the presence of\\nmaps, astronomical charts, and other scientific designs on an enlarged\\nscaleâ\\x80\\x94these things giving a naÃ¯ve and terrible corroboration to what\\nwe gathered from the pictorial friezes and dados.\\n\\nIn hinting at what the whole revealed, I can only hope that my account\\nwill not arouse a curiosity greater than sane caution on the part of\\nthose who believe me at all. It would be tragic if any were to be\\nallured to that realm of death and horror by the very warning meant to\\ndiscourage them.\\n\\nInterrupting these sculptured walls were high windows and massive\\ntwelve-foot doorways; both now and then retaining the petrified wooden\\nplanksâ\\x80\\x94elaborately carved and polishedâ\\x80\\x94of the actual shutters and\\ndoors. All metal fixtures had long ago vanished, but some of the doors\\nremained in place and had to be forced aside as we progressed from room\\nto room.\\n\\nWindow frames with odd transparent panesâ\\x80\\x94mostly ellipticalâ\\x80\\x94survived\\nhere and there, though in no considerable quantity. There were also\\nfrequent niches of great magnitude, generally empty, but once in a\\nwhile containing some bizarre object carved from green soapstone which\\nwas either broken or perhaps held too inferior to warrant removal.\\n\\nOther apertures were undoubtedly connected with bygone mechanical\\nfacilitiesâ\\x80\\x94heating, lighting, and the likeâ\\x80\\x94of a sort suggested in\\nmany of the carvings. Ceilings tended to be plain, but had sometimes\\nbeen inlaid with green soapstone or other tiles, mostly fallen now.\\nFloors were also paved with such tiles, though plain stonework\\npredominated.\\n\\nAs I have said, all furniture and other movables were absent; but the\\nsculptures gave a clear idea of the strange devices which had once\\nfilled these tomblike, echoing rooms. Above the glacial sheet the\\nfloors were generally thick with detritus, litter, and dÃ©bris, but\\nfarther down this condition decreased.\\n\\nIn some of the lower chambers and corridors there was little more than\\ngritty dust or ancient incrustations, while occasional areas had an\\nuncanny air of newly swept immaculateness. Of course, where rifts or\\ncollapses had occurred, the lower levels were as littered as the\\nupper ones.\\n\\nA central courtâ\\x80\\x94as we had seen in other structures, from the\\nairâ\\x80\\x94saved the inner regions from total darkness; so that we seldom had\\nto use our electric torches in the upper rooms except when studying\\nsculptured details. Below the ice cap, however, the twilight deepened;\\nand in many parts of the tangled ground level there was an approach to\\nabsolute blackness.\\n\\nTo form even a rudimentary idea of our thoughts and feelings as we\\npenetrated this Ã¦on-silent maze of unhuman masonry one must correlate\\na hopelessly bewildering chaos of fugitive moods, memories, and\\nimpressions. The sheer appalling antiquity and lethal desolation of the\\nplace were enough to overwhelm almost any sensitive person, but added\\nto these elements were the recent unexplained horror at the camp, and\\nthe revelations all too soon effected by the terrible mural sculptures\\naround us.\\n\\nThe moment we came upon a perfect section of carving, where no\\nambiguity of interpretation could exist, it took only a brief study\\nto give us the hideous truthâ\\x80\\x94a truth which it would be naÃ¯ve to claim\\nDanforth and I had not independently suspected before, though we had\\ncarefully refrained from even hinting it to each other. There could\\nnow be no further merciful doubt about the nature of the beings which\\nhad built and inhabited this monstrous dead city millions of years\\nago, when man\\'s ancestors were primitive archaic mammals, and vast\\nDinosauria roamed the tropical steppes of Europe and Asia.\\n\\nWe had previously clung to a desperate alternative and insistedâ\\x80\\x94each\\nto himselfâ\\x80\\x94that the omnipresence of the five-pointed motif meant only\\nsome cultural or religious exaltation of the archÃ¦an natural object\\nwhich had so patently embodied the quality of five-pointedness; as the\\ndecorative motifs of Minoan Crete exalted the sacred bull, those of\\nEgypt the scarabÃ¦us, those of Rome the wolf and the eagle, and those of\\nvarious savage tribes some chosen totem animal.\\n\\nBut this lone refuge was now stripped from us, and we were forced to\\nface definitely the reason-shaking realization which the reader of\\nthese pages has doubtless long ago anticipated. I can scarcely bear to\\nwrite it down in black and white even now, but perhaps that will not be\\nnecessary.\\n\\nThe things once rearing and dwelling in this frightful masonry in the\\nage of Dinosauria were not indeed Dinosauria, but far worse. Mere\\nDinosauria were new and almost brainless objectsâ\\x80\\x94but the builders of\\nthe city were wise and old, and had left certain traces in rocks even\\nthen laid down well nigh a thousand million yearsâ\\x80\\x94rocks laid down\\nbefore the true life of earth had advanced beyond plastic groups of\\ncellsâ\\x80\\x94rocks laid down before the true life of earth had existed at all.\\n\\nThey were the makers and enslavers of that life, and above all doubt\\nthe originals of the fiendish elder myths which things like the\\nPnakotic Manuscripts and the Necronomicon affrightedly hint about.\\nThey were the great \"Old Ones\" that had filtered down from the stars\\nwhen earth was youngâ\\x80\\x94the beings whose substance an alien evolution had\\nshaped, and whose powers were such as this planet had never bred. And\\nto think that only the day before Danforth and I had actually looked\\nupon fragments of their millennially fossilized substanceâ\\x80\\x94and that\\npoor Lake and his party had seen their complete outlinesâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94\\n\\nIt is, of course, impossible for me to relate in proper order the\\nstages by which we picked up what we know of that monstrous chapter of\\nprehuman life. After the first shock of the certain revelation, we had\\nto pause a while to recuperate, and it was fully three o\\'clock before\\nwe got started on our actual tour of systematic research.\\n\\nThe sculptures in the building we entered were of relatively late\\ndateâ\\x80\\x94perhaps two million years agoâ\\x80\\x94as checked up by geological,\\nbiological, and astronomical featuresâ\\x80\\x94and embodied an art which would\\nbe called decadent in comparison with that of specimens we found in\\nolder buildings, after crossing bridges under the glacial sheet.\\n\\nOne edifice hewn from the solid rock seemed to go back forty or\\npossibly even fifty million yearsâ\\x80\\x94to the lower Eocene or upper\\nCretaceousâ\\x80\\x94and contained bas-reliefs of an artistry surpassing\\nanything else, with one tremendous exception, that we encountered. That\\nwas, we have since agreed, the oldest domestic structure we traversed.\\n\\nWere it not for the support of those flashlights soon to be made\\npublic, I would refrain from telling what I found and inferred, lest I\\nbe confined as a madman. Of course, the infinitely early parts of the\\npatchwork taleâ\\x80\\x94representing the preterrestrial life of the star-headed\\nbeings on other planets, in other galaxies, and in other universesâ\\x80\\x94can\\nreadily be interpreted as the fantastic mythology of those beings\\nthemselves; yet such parts sometimes involved designs and diagrams so\\nuncannily close to the latest findings of mathematics and astrophysics\\nthat I scarcely know what to think. Let others judge when they see the\\nphotographs I shall publish.\\n\\nNaturally, no one set of carvings which we encountered told more than a\\nfraction of any connected story, nor did we even begin to come upon the\\nvarious stages of that story in their proper order. Some of the vast\\nrooms were independent units so far as their designs were concerned,\\nwhilst in other cases a continuous chronicle would be carried through a\\nseries of rooms and corridors.\\n\\nThe best of the maps and diagrams were on the walls of a frightful\\nabyss below even the ancient ground levelâ\\x80\\x94a cavern perhaps two hundred\\nfeet square and sixty feet high, which had almost undoubtedly been an\\neducational center of some sort.\\n\\nThere were many provoking repetitions of the same material in different\\nrooms and buildings, since certain chapters of experience, and certain\\nsummaries or phases of racial history, had evidently been favorites\\nwith different decorators or dwellers. Sometimes, though, variant\\nversions of the same theme proved useful in settling debatable points\\nand filling up gaps.\\n\\nI still wonder that we deduced so much in the short time at our\\ndisposal. Of course, we even now have only the barest outlineâ\\x80\\x94and\\nmuch of that was obtained later on from a study of the photographs and\\nsketches we made.\\n\\nIt may be the effect of this later studyâ\\x80\\x94the revived memories and\\nvague impressions acting in conjunction with his general sensitiveness\\nand with that final supposed horror-glimpse whose essence he will not\\nreveal even to meâ\\x80\\x94which has been the immediate source of Danforth\\'s\\npresent breakdown.\\n\\nBut it had to be; for we could not issue our warning intelligently\\nwithout the fullest possible information, and the issuance of that\\nwarning is a prime necessity. Certain lingering influences in that\\nunknown antarctic world of disordered time and alien natural law make\\nit imperative that further exploration be discouraged.\\n\\nVII.\\n\\nThe full story, so far as deciphered, will eventually appear in an\\nofficial bulletin of Miskatonic University. Here I shall sketch only\\nthe salient highlights in a formless, rambling way. Myth or otherwise,\\nthe sculptures told of the coming of those star-headed things to the\\nnascent, lifeless earth out of cosmic spaceâ\\x80\\x94their coming, and the\\ncoming of many other alien entities such as at certain times embark\\nupon spatial pioneering.\\n\\nThey seemed able to traverse the interstellar ether on their vast\\nmembranous wingsâ\\x80\\x94thus oddly confirming some curious hill folklore long\\nago told me by an antiquarian colleague. They had lived under the sea a\\ngood deal, building fantastic cities and fighting terrific battles with\\nnameless adversaries by means of intricate devices employing unknown\\nprinciples of energy.\\n\\nEvidently their scientific and mechanical knowledge far surpassed\\nman\\'s to-day, though they made use of its more widespread and elaborate\\nforms only when obliged to.\\n\\nSome of the sculptures suggested that they had passed through a stage\\nof mechanized life on other planets, but had receded upon finding\\nits effects emotionally unsatisfying. Their preternatural toughness\\nof organization and simplicity of natural wants made them peculiarly\\nable to live on a high plane without the more specialized fruits\\nof artificial manufacture, and even without garments, except for\\noccasional protection against the elements.\\n\\nIt was under the sea, at first for food and later for other purposes,\\nthat they first created earth lifeâ\\x80\\x94using available substances\\naccording to long-known methods.\\n\\nThe more elaborate experiments came after the annihilation of various\\ncosmic enemies. They had done the same thing on other planets, having\\nmanufactured not only necessary foods, but certain multicellular\\nprotoplasmic masses capable of molding their tissues into all sorts of\\ntemporary organs under hypnotic influence and thereby forming ideal\\nslaves to perform the heavy work of the community.\\n\\nThese viscous masses were without doubt what Abdul Alhazred whispered\\nabout as the \"Shoggoths\" in his frightful Necronomicon , though even\\nthat mad Arab had not hinted that any existed on earth except in the\\ndreams of those who had chewed a certain alkaloidal herb.\\n\\nWhen the star-headed Old Ones on this planet had synthesized their\\nsimple food forms and bred a good supply of Shoggoths, they allowed\\nother cell groups to develop into other forms of animal and vegetable\\nlife for sundry purposes, extirpating any whose presence became\\ntroublesome.\\n\\nWith the aid of the Shoggoths, whose expansions could be made to lift\\nprodigious weights, the small, low cities under the sea grew to vast\\nand imposing labyrinths of stone not unlike those which later rose on\\nland. Indeed, the highly adaptable Old Ones had lived much on land in\\nother parts of the universe, and probably retained many traditions of\\nland construction.\\n\\nAs we studied the architecture of all these sculptured PalÃ¦ogÃ¦an\\ncities, including that whose Ã¦on-dead corridors we were even then\\ntraversing, we were impressed by a curious coincidence which we have\\nnot yet tried to explain, even to ourselves. The tops of the buildings,\\nwhich in the actual city around us had, of course, been weathered into\\nshapeless ruins ages ago, were clearly displayed in the bas-reliefs,\\nand showed vast clusters of needlelike spires, delicate finials\\non certain cone and pyramid apexes, and tiers of thin, horizontal\\nscalloped disks capping cylindrical shafts.\\n\\nThis was exactly what we had seen in that monstrous and portentous\\nmirage, cast by a dead city whence such sky-line features had been\\nabsent for thousands and ten of thousands of years, which loomed on our\\nignorant eyes across the unfathomed mountains of madness as we first\\napproached poor Lake\\'s ill-fated camp.\\n\\nOf the life of the Old Ones, both under the sea and after part of them\\nmigrated to land, volumes could be written. Those in shallow water had\\ncontinued the fullest use of the eyes at the ends of their five main\\nhead tentacles, and had practiced the arts of sculpture and of writing\\nin quite the usual wayâ\\x80\\x94the writing accomplished with a stylus on\\nwaterproof waxen surfaces.\\n\\nThose lower down in the ocean depths, though they used a curious\\nphosphorescent organism to furnish light, pieced out their vision with\\nobscure special senses operating through the prismatic cilia on their\\nheadsâ\\x80\\x94senses which rendered all the Old Ones partly independent of\\nlight in emergencies. Their forms of sculpture and writing had changed\\ncuriously during the descent, embodying certain apparently chemical\\ncoating processesâ\\x80\\x94probably to secure phosphorescenceâ\\x80\\x94which the\\nbas-reliefs could not make clear to us.\\n\\nThe beings moved in the sea partly by swimmingâ\\x80\\x94using the lateral\\ncrinoid armsâ\\x80\\x94and partly by wriggling with the lower tier of tentacles\\ncontaining the pseudofeet. Occasionally they accomplished long swoops\\nwith the auxiliary use of two or more sets of their fan-like folding\\nwings.\\n\\nOn land they locally used the pseudofeet, but now and then flew to\\ngreat heights or over long distances with their wings. The many\\nslender tentacles into which the crinoid arms branched were infinitely\\ndelicate, flexible, strong, and accurate in muscular-nervous\\ncoÃ¶rdinationâ\\x80\\x94ensuring the utmost skill and dexterity in all artistic\\nand other manual operations.\\n\\nThe toughness of the things was almost incredible. Even the terrific\\npressure of the deepest sea bottoms appeared powerless to harm them.\\nVery few seemed to die at all except by violence, and their burial\\nplaces were very limited. The facts that they covered their vertically\\ninhumed dead with five-pointed inscribed mounds set up thoughts in\\nDanforth and me which made a fresh pause and recuperation necessary\\nafter the sculptures revealed it.\\n\\nThe toughness of the things was almost incredible. Even terrific pressures were powerless to harm them!\\n\\nThe beings multiplied by means of sporesâ\\x80\\x94like vegetable pteridophyta,\\nas Lake had suspectedâ\\x80\\x94but, owing to their prodigious toughness and\\nlongevity, and consequent lack of replacement needs, they did not\\nencourage the large-scale development of new prothallia except when\\nthey had new regions to colonize.\\n\\nThe young matured swiftly, and received an education evidently beyond\\nany standard we can imagine. The prevailing intellectual and Ã¦sthetic\\nlife was highly evolved, and produced a tenaciously enduring set of\\ncustoms and institutions which I shall describe more fully in my coming\\nmonograph. These varied slightly according to sea or land residence,\\nbut had the same foundations and essentials.\\n\\nThough able, like vegetables, to derive nourishment from inorganic\\nsubstances; they vastly preferred organic and especially animal food.\\nThey ate uncooked marine life under the sea, but cooked their viands on\\nland. They hunted game and raised meat herdsâ\\x80\\x94slaughtering with sharp\\nweapons whose odd marks on certain fossil bones our expedition had\\nnoted.\\n\\nThey resisted all ordinary temperatures marvelously, and in their\\nnatural state could live in water down to freezing. When the great\\nchill of the Pleistocene drew on, howeverâ\\x80\\x94nearly a million years\\nagoâ\\x80\\x94the land dwellers had to resort to special measures, including\\nartificial heatingâ\\x80\\x94until, at last, the deadly cold appears to have\\ndriven them back into the sea.\\n\\nFor their prehistoric flights through cosmic space, legend said, they\\nhad absorbed certain chemicals and become almost independent of eating,\\nbreathing, or heat conditionsâ\\x80\\x94but by the time of the great cold\\nthey had lost track of the method. In any case, they could not have\\nprolonged the artificial state indefinitely without harm.\\n\\nBeing nonpairing and semivegetable in structure, the Old Ones had\\nno biological basis for the family phase of mammal life, but seemed\\nto organize large households on the principles of comfortable\\nspace-utility andâ\\x80\\x94as we deduced from the pictured occupations and\\ndiversions of codwellersâ\\x80\\x94congenial mental association.\\n\\nIn furnishing their homes they kept everything in the center of the\\nhuge rooms, leaving all wall spaces free for decorative treatment.\\nLighting, in the case of the land inhabitants, was accomplished by a\\ndevice probably electro-chemical in nature.\\n\\nBoth on land and under water they used curious tables, chairs and\\ncouches like cylindrical framesâ\\x80\\x94for they rested and slept upright with\\nfolded-down tentaclesâ\\x80\\x94and racks for the hinged sets of dotted surfaces\\nforming their books.\\n\\nGovernment was evidently complex and probably socialistic, though no\\ncertainties in this regard could be deduced from the sculptures we\\nsaw. There was extensive commerce, both local and between different\\ncitiesâ\\x80\\x94certain small, flat counters, five-pointed and inscribed,\\nserving as money. Probably the smaller of the various greenish\\nsoapstones found by our expedition were pieces of such currency.\\n\\nThough the culture was mainly urban, some agriculture and much stock\\nraising existed. Mining and a limited amount of manufacturing were also\\npracticed. Travel was very frequent, but permanent migration seemed\\nrelatively rare except for the vast colonizing movements by which the\\nrace expanded.\\n\\nFor personal locomotion no external aid was used, since in land, air,\\nand water movement alike the Old Ones seemed to possess excessively\\nvast capacities for speed. Loads, however, were drawn by beasts of\\nburdenâ\\x80\\x94Shoggoths under the sea, and a curious variety of primitive\\nvertebrates in the later years of land existence.\\n\\nThese vertebrates, as well as an infinity of other life formsâ\\x80\\x94animal\\nand vegetable, marine, terrestrial, and aÃ«rialâ\\x80\\x94were the products of\\nunguided evolution acting on life cells made by the Old Ones, but\\nescaping beyond their radius of attention. They had been suffered\\nto develop unchecked because they had not come in conflict with the\\ndominant beings. Bothersome forms, of course, were mechanically\\nexterminated.\\n\\nIt interested us to see in some of the very last and most decadent\\nsculptures a shambling, primitive mammal, used sometimes for food and\\nsometimes as an amusing buffoon by the land dwellers, whose vaguely\\nsimian and human foreshadowings were unmistakable. In the building of\\nland cities the huge stone blocks of the high towers were generally\\nlifted by vast-winged pterodactyls of a species heretofore unknown to\\npalÃ¦ontology.\\n\\nThe persistence with which the Old Ones survived various geologic\\nchanges and convulsions of the earth\\'s crust was little short of\\nmiraculous. Though few or none of their first cities seem to have\\nremained beyond the ArchÃ¦an Age, there was no interruption in their\\ncivilization or in the transmission of their records.\\n\\nTheir original place of advent to the planet was the Antarctic Ocean,\\nand it is likely that they came not long after the matter forming the\\nmoon was wrenched from the neighboring South Pacific. According to one\\nof the sculptured maps, the whole globe was then under water, with\\nstone cities scattered farther and farther from the antarctic as Ã¦ons\\npassed.\\n\\nAnother map shows a vast bulk of dry land around the south pole, where\\nit is evident that some of the beings made experimental settlements,\\nthough their main centers were transferred to the nearest sea bottom.\\n\\nLater maps, which display this land mass as cracking and drifting, and\\nsending certain detached parts northward, uphold in a striking way the\\ntheories of continental drift lately advanced by Taylor, Wegener, and\\nJoly.\\n\\nWith the upheaval of new land in the South Pacific, tremendous events\\nbegan. Some of the marine cities were hopelessly shattered, yet that\\nwas not the worst misfortune. Another raceâ\\x80\\x94a land race of beings\\nshaped like octopi and probably corresponding to the fabulous prehuman\\nspawn of Cthulhuâ\\x80\\x94soon began filtering down from cosmic infinity and\\nprecipitated a monstrous war which for a time drove the Old Ones\\nwholly back to the seaâ\\x80\\x94a colossal blow in view of the increasing land\\nsettlements.\\n\\nLater, peace was made, and the new lands were given to the Cthulhu\\nspawn whilst the Old Ones held the sea and the older lands. New land\\ncities were foundedâ\\x80\\x94the greatest of them in the antarctic, for this\\nregion of first arrival was sacred.\\n\\nFrom then on, as before, the antarctic remained the center of the Old\\nOnes\\' civilization, and all the cities built there by the Cthulhu spawn\\nwere blotted out.\\n\\nThen, suddenly, the lands of the Pacific sank again, taking with them\\nthe frightful stone city of R\\'lyeh and all the cosmic octopi, so that\\nthe Old Ones were again supreme on the planet, except for one shadowy\\nfear about which they did not like to speak.\\n\\nAt a rather later age their cities dotted all the land and water areas\\nof the globeâ\\x80\\x94hence the recommendation in my coming monograph that some\\narchÃ¦ologist make systematic borings with Pabodie\\'s type of apparatus\\nin certain widely separated regions.\\n\\nThe steady trend down the ages was from water to landâ\\x80\\x94a movement\\nencouraged by the rise of new land masses, though the ocean was never\\nwholly deserted. Another cause of the landward movement was the new\\ndifficulty in breeding and managing the Shoggoths upon which successful\\nsea life depended.\\n\\nWith the march of time, as the sculptures sadly confessed, the art of\\ncreating new life from inorganic matter had been lost, so that the Old\\nOnes had to depend on the molding of forms already in existence. On\\nland the great reptiles proved highly tractable; but the Shoggoths of\\nthe sea, reproducing by fission and acquiring a dangerous degree of\\naccidental intelligence, presented for a time a formidable problem.\\n\\nThey had always been controlled through the hypnotic suggestion of\\nthe Old Ones, and had modeled their tough plasticity into various\\nuseful temporary limbs and organs; but now their self-modeling powers\\nwere sometimes exercised independently, and in various imitative\\nforms implanted by past suggestion. They had, it seems, developed a\\nsemistable brain whose separate and occasionally stubborn volition\\nechoed the will of the Old Ones without always obeying it.\\n\\nSculptured images of these Shoggoths filled Danforth and me with\\nhorror and loathing. They were normally shapeless entities composed\\nof a viscous jelly which looked like an agglutination of bubbles, and\\neach averaged about fifteen feet in diameter when a sphere. They had,\\nhowever, a constantly shifting shape and volumeâ\\x80\\x94throwing out temporary\\ndevelopments or forming apparent organs of sight, hearing, and speech\\nin imitation of their masters, either spontaneously or according to\\nsuggestion.\\n\\nThey seem to have become peculiarly intractable toward the middle of\\nthe Permian Age, perhaps one hundred and fifty million years ago, when\\na veritable war of resubjugation was waged upon them by the marine Old\\nOnes. Pictures of this war, and of the headless, slime-coated fashion\\nin which the Shoggoths typically left their slain victims, held a\\nmarvelously fearsome quality despite the intervening abyss of untold\\nages.\\n\\nThe Old Ones had used curious weapons of molecular disturbance against\\nthe rebel entities, and in the end had achieved a complete victory.\\nThereafter the sculptures showed a period in which Shoggoths were tamed\\nand broken by armed Old Ones as the wild horses of the American west\\nwere tamed by cowboys.\\n\\nThough during the rebellion the Shoggoths had shown an ability to\\nlive out of water, this transition was not encouragedâ\\x80\\x94since their\\nusefulness on land would hardly have been commensurate with the trouble\\nof their management.\\n\\nDuring the Jurassic Age the Old Ones met fresh adversity in the\\nform of a new invasion from outer spaceâ\\x80\\x94this time by half-fungous,\\nhalf-crustacean creaturesâ\\x80\\x94creatures undoubtedly the same as those\\nfiguring in certain whispered hill legends of the north, and remembered\\nin the Himalayas as the Mi-Go, or Abominable Snow Men.\\n\\nTo fight these beings the Old Ones attempted, for the first time\\nsince their terrene advent, to sally forth again into the planetary\\nether; but, despite all traditional preparations, found it no longer\\npossible to leave the earth\\'s atmosphere. Whatever the old secret of\\ninterstellar travel had been, it was now definitely lost to the race.\\n\\nIn the end the Mi-Go drove the Old Ones out of all the northern lands,\\nthough they were powerless to disturb those in the sea. Little by\\nlittle the slow retreat of the elder race to their original antarctic\\nhabitat was beginning.\\n\\nIt was curious to note from the pictured battles that both the Cthulhu\\nspawn and the Mi-Go seem to have been composed of matter more widely\\ndifferent from that which we know than was the substance of the Old\\nOnes. They were able to undergo transformations and reintegrations\\nimpossible for their adversaries, and seem therefore to have originally\\ncome from even remoter gulfs of cosmic space.\\n\\nThe Old Ones, but for their abnormal toughness and peculiar vital\\nproperties, were strictly material, and must have had their absolute\\norigin within the known space-time continuumâ\\x80\\x94whereas the first\\nsources of the other beings can only be guessed at with bated breath.\\nAll this, of course, assuming that the nonterrestrial linkages and\\nthe anomalies ascribed to the invading foes are not pure mythology.\\nConceivably, the Old Ones might have invented a cosmic framework\\nto account for their occasional defeats, since historical interest\\nand pride obviously formed their chief psychological element. It is\\nsignificant that their annals failed to mention many advanced and\\npotent races of beings whose mighty cultures and towering ethics figure\\npersistently in certain obscure legends.\\n\\nThe changing state of the world through long geologic ages appeared\\nwith startling vividness in many of the sculptured maps and scenes. In\\ncertain cases existing science will require revision, while in other\\ncases its bold deductions are magnificently confirmed.\\n\\nAs I have said, the hypothesis of Taylor, Wegener, and Joly that all\\nthe continents are fragments of an original antarctic land mass which\\ncracked from centrifugal force and drifted apart over a technically\\nviscous lower surfaceâ\\x80\\x94an hypothesis suggested by such things as the\\ncomplimentary outlines of Africa and South America, and the way the\\ngreat mountain chains are rolled and shoved upâ\\x80\\x94receives striking\\nsupport from this uncanny source.\\n\\nMaps evidently showing the Carboniferous of a hundred million or\\nmore years ago displayed significant rifts and chasms destined later\\nto separate Africa from the once continuous realms of Europe (then\\nthe Valusia of primal legend), Asia, the Americas, and the antarctic\\ncontinent.\\n\\nOther chartsâ\\x80\\x94and most significantly one in connection with the\\nfounding fifty million years ago of the vast dead city around\\nusâ\\x80\\x94showed all the present continents well differentiated. And in\\nthe latest discoverable specimenâ\\x80\\x94dating perhaps from the Pliocene\\nAgeâ\\x80\\x94the approximate world of to-day appeared quite clearly despite the\\nlinkage of Alaska with Siberia, of North America with Europe through\\nGreenland, and of South America with the antarctic continent through\\nGraham Land.\\n\\nIn the Carboniferous map the whole globeâ\\x80\\x94ocean floor and rifted land\\nmass alikeâ\\x80\\x94bore symbols of the Old Ones\\' vast stone cities, but in the\\nlater charts the gradual recession toward the antarctic became very\\nplain.\\n\\nThe final Pliocene specimen showed no land cities except on the\\nantarctic continent and the tip of South America, nor any ocean\\ncities north of the fiftieth parallel of South Latitude. Knowledge\\nand interest in the northern world, save for a study of coast lines\\nprobably made during long exploration flights on those fan-like\\nmembranous wings, had evidently declined to zero among the Old Ones.\\n\\nDestruction of cities through the up-thrust of mountains, the\\ncentrifugal rending of continents, the seismic convulsions of land or\\nsea bottom, and other natural causes was a matter of common record; and\\nit was curious to observe how fewer and fewer replacements were made as\\nthe ages wore on.\\n\\nThe vast dead megalopolis that yawned around us seemed to be the last\\ngeneral center of the raceâ\\x80\\x94built early in the Cretaceous Age after a\\ntitanic earth buckling had obliterated a still vaster predecessor not\\nfar distant.\\n\\nIt appeared that this general region was the most sacred spot of\\nall, where reputedly the first Old Ones had settled on a primal sea\\nbottom. In the new cityâ\\x80\\x94many of whose features we could recognize\\nin the sculptures, but which stretched fully a hundred miles along\\nthe mountain range in each direction beyond the farthest limits of\\nour aÃ«rial surveyâ\\x80\\x94there were reputed to be preserved certain sacred\\nstones forming part of the first sea-bottom city, which were thrust up\\nto light after long epochs in the course of the general crumpling of\\nstrata.\\n\\nVIII.\\n\\nNaturally, Danforth and I studied with special interest and a\\npeculiarly personal sense of awe everything pertaining to the immediate\\ndistrict in which we were. Of this local material there was naturally a\\nvast abundance.\\n\\nOn the tangled ground level of the city we were lucky enough to find\\na house of very late date whose walls, though somewhat damaged by a\\nneighboring rift, contained sculptures of decadent workmanship carrying\\nthe story of the region, much beyond the Pliocene map, whence we\\nderived our last general glimpse of the prehuman world. This was the\\nlast place we examined in detail, since what we found there set upon us\\na fresh, immediate objective.\\n\\nCertainly, we were in one of the strangest, weirdest, and most terrible\\nof all the corners of earth\\'s globe. Of all existing lands it was\\ninfinitely the most ancient. The conviction grew upon us that this\\nhideous upland must indeed be the fabled nightmare plateau of Leng\\nwhich even the mad author of the Necronomicon was reluctant to\\ndiscuss.\\n\\nThe great mountain chain was tremendously longâ\\x80\\x94starting as a low range\\nat Luitpold Land on the coast of Weddell Sea and virtually crossing the\\nentire continent. The really high part stretched in a mighty arc from\\nabout Latitude 82Â°, E. Longitude 60Â° to Latitude 70Â°, East Longitude\\n115Â°, with its concave side toward our camp and its seaward end in the\\nregion of that long, ice-locked coast whose hills were glimpsed by\\nWilkes and Mawson at the antarctic circle.\\n\\nYet even more monstrous exaggerations of nature seemed disturbingly\\nclose at hand. I have said that these peaks are higher than the\\nHimalayas, but the sculptures forbid me to say that they are earth\\'s\\nhighest. That grim honor is beyond doubt reserved for something\\nwhich half the sculptures hesitated to record at all, whilst others\\napproached it with obvious repugnance and trepidation.\\n\\nIt seems that there was one part of the ancient landâ\\x80\\x94the first part\\nthat ever rose from the waters after the earth had flung off the moon\\nand the Old Ones had seeped down from the starsâ\\x80\\x94which had come to be\\nshunned as vaguely and namelessly evil. Cities built there had crumbled\\nbefore their time, and had been found suddenly deserted.\\n\\nThen when the first great earth buckling had convulsed the region in\\nthe Comanchean Age, a frightful line of peaks had shot suddenly up\\namidst the most appalling din and chaosâ\\x80\\x94and earth had received her\\nloftiest and most terrible mountains.\\n\\nIf the scale of the carvings was correct, these abhorred things must\\nhave been much over forty thousand feet highâ\\x80\\x94radically vaster than\\neven the shocking mountains of madness we had crossed. They extended,\\nit appeared, from about Latitude 77Â°, E. Longitude 70Â° to Latitude 70Â°,\\nE. Longitude 100Â°â\\x80\\x94less than three hundred miles away from the dead\\ncity, so that we would have spied their dreaded summits in the dim\\nwestern distance had it not been for that vague, opalescent haze. Their\\nnorthern end must likewise be visible from the long antarctic circle\\ncoast line at Queen Mary Land.\\n\\nSome of the Old Ones, in the decadent days, had made strange prayers\\nto those mountainsâ\\x80\\x94but none ever went near them or dared to guess\\nwhat lay beyond. No human eye had ever seen them, and as I studied the\\nemotions conveyed in the carvings I prayed that none ever might.\\n\\nThere are protecting hills along the coast beyond themâ\\x80\\x94Queen Mary and\\nKaiser Wilhelm Landsâ\\x80\\x94and I thank Heaven no one has been able to land\\nand climb those hills. I am not as sceptical about old tales and fears\\nas I used to be, and I do not laugh now at the prehuman sculptor\\'s\\nnotion that lightning paused meaningfully now and then at each of the\\nbrooding crests, and that an unexplained glow shone from one of those\\nterrible pinnacles all through the long polar night. There may be a\\nvery real and very monstrous meaning in the old Pnakotic whispers about\\nKadath in the Cold Waste.\\n\\nBut the terrain close at hand was hardly less strange, even if less\\nnamelessly accursed. Soon after the founding of the city the great\\nmountain range became the seat of the principal temples, and many\\ncarvings showed what grotesque and fantastic towers had pierced the sky\\nwhere now we saw only the curiously clinging cubes and ramparts.\\n\\nIn the course of ages the caves had appeared, and had been shaped into\\nadjuncts of the temples. With the advance of still later epochs all\\nthe limestone veins of the region were hollowed out by ground waters,\\nso that the mountains, the foothills, and the plains below them were\\na veritable network of connected caverns and galleries. Many graphic\\nsculptures told of explorations deep underground, and of the final\\ndiscovery of the Stygian sunless sea that lurked at earth\\'s bowels.\\n\\nThis vast nighted gulf had undoubtedly been worn by the great river\\nwhich flowed down from the nameless and horrible westward mountains,\\nand which had formerly turned at the base of the Old Ones\\' range and\\nflowed beside that chain into the Indian Ocean between Budd and Totten\\nLands on Wilkes\\'s coast line. Little by little it had eaten away the\\nlimestone hill base at its turning, till at last its sapping currents\\nreached the caverns of the ground waters and joined with them in\\ndigging a deeper abyss.\\n\\nFinally its whole bulk emptied into the hollow hills and left the old\\nbed toward the ocean dry. Much of the later city as we now found it\\nhad been built over that former bed. The Old Ones, understanding what\\nhad happened, and exercising their always keen artistic sense, had\\ncarved into ornate pylons those headlands of the foothills where the\\ngreat stream began its descent into eternal darkness.\\n\\nThis river, once crossed by scores of noble stone bridges, was plainly\\nthe one whose extinct course we had seen in our aÃ«roplane survey.\\nIts position in different carvings of the city helped us to orient\\nourselves to the scene as it had been at various stages of the region\\'s\\nage-long, Ã¦on-dead history, so that we were able to sketch a hasty but\\ncareful map of the salient featuresâ\\x80\\x94squares, important buildings, and\\nthe likeâ\\x80\\x94for guidance in further explorations.\\n\\nWe could soon reconstruct in fancy the whole stupendous thing as it was\\na million or ten million or fifty million years ago, for the sculptures\\ntold us exactly what the buildings and mountains and squares and\\nsuburbs and landscape setting and luxuriant Tertiary vegetation had\\nlooked like.\\n\\nIt must have had a marvelous and mystic beauty, and as I thought of\\nit I almost forgot the clammy sense of sinister oppression with which\\nthe city\\'s inhuman age and massiveness and deadness and remoteness and\\nglacial twilight had choked and weighed on my spirit.\\n\\nYet, according to certain carvings the denizens of that city had\\nthemselves known the clutch of oppressive terror; for there was a\\nsomber and recurrent type of scene in which the Old Ones were shown in\\nthe act of recoiling affrightedly from some objectâ\\x80\\x94never allowed to\\nappear in the designâ\\x80\\x94found in the great river and indicated as having\\nbeen washed down through waving, vine-draped cycad forests from those\\nhorrible westward mountains.\\n\\nIt was only in the one late-built house with the decadent carvings that\\nwe obtained any foreshadowing of the final calamity leading to the\\ncity\\'s desertion. Undoubtedly there must have been many sculptures of\\nthe same age elsewhere, even allowing for the slackened energies and\\naspirations of a stressful and uncertain period; indeed, very certain\\nevidence of the existence of others came to us shortly afterward. But\\nthis was the first and only set we directly encountered.\\n\\nWe meant to look farther later on; but as I have said, immediate\\nconditions dictated another present objective. There would, though,\\nhave been a limitâ\\x80\\x94for after all hope of a long future occupancy of the\\nplace had perished among the Old Ones, there could not but have been a\\ncomplete cessation of mural decoration. The ultimate blow, of course,\\nwas the coming of the great cold which once held most of the earth in\\nthrall, and which has never departed from the ill-fated polesâ\\x80\\x94the\\ngreat cold that, at the world\\'s other extremity, put an end to the\\nfabled lands of Lomar and Hyperborea.\\n\\nJust when this tendency began in the antarctic it would be hard to say\\nin terms of exact years. Nowadays we set the beginning of the general\\nglacial periods at a distance of about five hundred thousand years from\\nthe present, but at the poles the terrible scourge must have commenced\\nmuch earlier. All quantitative estimates are partly guesswork, but it\\nis quite likely that the decadent sculptures were made considerably\\nless than a million years ago, and that the actual desertion of\\nthe city was complete long before the conventional opening of the\\nPleistoceneâ\\x80\\x94five hundred thousand years agoâ\\x80\\x94as reckoned in terms of\\nthe earth\\'s whole surface.\\n\\nIn the decadent sculptures there were signs of thinner vegetation\\neverywhere, and of a decreased country life on the part of the Old\\nOnes. Heating devices were shown in the houses, and winter travelers\\nwere represented as muffled in protective fabrics. Then we saw a\\nseries of cartouchesâ\\x80\\x94the continuous band arrangement being frequently\\ninterrupted in these late carvingsâ\\x80\\x94depicting a constantly growing\\nmigration to the nearest refuges of greater warmthâ\\x80\\x94some fleeing to\\ncities under the sea off the far-away coast, and some clambering down\\nthrough networks of limestone caverns in the hollow hills to the\\nneighboring black abyss of subterrane waters.\\n\\nIn the end, it seems to have been the neighboring abyss which received\\nthe greatest colonization. This was partly due, no doubt, to the\\ntraditional sacredness of this special region, but may have been more\\nconclusively determined by the opportunities it gave for continuing\\nthe use of the great temples on the honeycombed mountains, and for\\nretaining the vast land city as a place of summer residence and base of\\ncommunication with various mines.\\n\\nThe linkage of old and new abodes was made more effective by means\\nof several gradings and improvements along the connecting routes,\\nincluding the chiseling of numerous direct tunnels from the ancient\\nmetropolis to the black abyssâ\\x80\\x94sharply down-pointing tunnels whose\\nmouths we carefully drew, according to our most thoughtful estimates,\\non the guide map we were compiling.\\n\\nIt was obvious that at least two of these tunnels lay within a\\nreasonable exploring distance of where we wereâ\\x80\\x94both being on the\\nmountainward edge of the city, one less than a quarter of a mile toward\\nthe ancient rivercourse, and the other perhaps twice that distance in\\nthe opposite direction.\\n\\nThe abyss, it seems, had shelving shores of dry land at certain places,\\nbut the Old Ones built their new city under waterâ\\x80\\x94no doubt because of\\nits greater certainty of uniform warmth. The depth of the hidden sea\\nappears to have been very great, so that the earth\\'s internal heat\\ncould insure its habitability for an indefinite period.\\n\\nThe beings seem to have had no trouble in adapting themselves to\\npart-timeâ\\x80\\x94and eventually, of course, whole-timeâ\\x80\\x94residence under\\nwater, since they had never allowed their gill systems to atrophy.\\n\\nThere were many sculptures which showed how they had always frequently\\nvisited their submarine kinsfolk elsewhere, and how they had habitually\\nbathed on the deep bottom of their great river. The darkness of inner\\nearth could likewise have been no deterrent to a race accustomed to\\nlong antarctic nights.\\n\\nDecadent though their style undoubtedly was, these latest carvings\\nhad a truly epic quality where they told of the building of\\nthe new city in the cavern sea. The Old Ones had gone about it\\nscientificallyâ\\x80\\x94quarrying insoluble rocks from the heart of the\\nhoneycombed mountains, and employing expert workers from the nearest\\nsubmarine city to perform the construction according to the best\\nmethods.\\n\\nThese workers brought with them all that was necessary to establish\\nthe new ventureâ\\x80\\x94Shoggoth tissue from which to breed stone lifters and\\nsubsequent beasts of burden for the cavern city, and other protoplasmic\\nmatter to mold into phosphorescent organisms for lighting purposes.\\n\\nAt last a mighty metropolis rose on the bottom of that Stygian sea,\\nits architecture much like that of the city above, and its workmanship\\ndisplaying relatively little decadence because of the precise\\nmathematical element inherent in building operations.\\n\\nThe newly bred Shoggoths grew to enormous size and singular\\nintelligence, and were represented as taking and executing orders with\\nmarvelous quickness. They seemed to converse with the Old Ones by\\nmimicking their voicesâ\\x80\\x94a sort of musical piping over a wide range,\\nif poor Lake\\'s dissection had indicated arightâ\\x80\\x94and to work more from\\nspoken commands than from hypnotic suggestions as in earlier times.\\n\\nThey were, however, kept in admirable control. The phosphorescent\\norganisms supplied light with vast effectiveness, and doubtless atoned\\nfor the loss of the familiar polar auroras of the outer-world night.\\n\\nArt and decoration were pursued, though, of course, with a certain\\ndecadence. The Old Ones seemed to realize this falling off themselves,\\nand in many cases anticipated the policy of Constantine the Great by\\ntransplanting especially fine blocks of ancient carving from their\\nland city, just as the emperor, in a similar age of decline, stripped\\nGreece and Asia of their finest art to give his new Byzantine capital\\ngreater splendors than its own people could create. That the transfer\\nof sculptured blocks had not been more extensive, was doubtless owing\\nto the fact that the land city was not at first wholly abandoned.\\n\\nBy the time total abandonment did occurâ\\x80\\x94and it surely must have\\noccurred before the polar Pleistocene was far advancedâ\\x80\\x94the Old Ones\\nhad perhaps become satisfied with their decadent artâ\\x80\\x94or had ceased\\nto recognize the superior merit of the older carvings. At any rate,\\nthe Ã¦on-silent ruins around us had certainly undergone no wholesale\\nsculptural denudation, though all the best separate statues, like other\\nmovables, had been taken away.\\n\\nThe decadent cartouches and dados telling this story were, as I have\\nsaid, the latest we could find in our limited search. They left us with\\na picture of the Old Ones shuttling back and forth betwixt the land\\ncity in summer and the sea-cavern city in winter, and sometimes trading\\nwith the sea-bottom cities off the antarctic coast.\\n\\nBy this time the ultimate doom of the land city must have been\\nrecognized, for the sculptures showed many signs of the cold\\'s malign\\nencroachments. Vegetation was declining, and the terrible snows of the\\nwinter no longer melted completely even in midsummer.\\n\\nThe saurian live stock were nearly all dead, and the mammals were\\nstanding it none too well. To keep on with the work of the upper\\nworld it had become necessary to adapt some of the amorphous and\\ncuriously cold-resistant Shoggoths to land lifeâ\\x80\\x94a thing the Old Ones\\nhad formerly been reluctant to do. The great river was now lifeless,\\nand the upper sea had lost most of its denizens except the seals and\\nwhales. All the birds had flown away, save only the great, grotesque\\npenguins.\\n\\nWhat had happened afterward we could only guess. How long had the new\\nsea-cavern city survived? Was it still down there, a stony corpse in\\neternal blackness? Had the subterranean waters frozen at last? To what\\nfate had the ocean-bottom cities of the outer world been delivered?\\nHad any of the Old Ones shifted north ahead of the creeping ice cap?\\nExisting geology shows no trace of their presence. Had the frightful\\nMi-Go been still a menace in the outer land world of the north? Could\\none be sure of what might or might not linger, even to this day, in the\\nlightless and unplumbed abysses of earth\\'s deepest water?\\n\\nThose things had seemingly been able to withstand any amount of\\npressureâ\\x80\\x94and men of the sea have fished up curious objects at\\ntimes. And has the killer-whale theory really explained the savage\\nand mysterious scars on antarctic seals noticed a generation ago by\\nBorchgrevingk?\\n\\nThe specimens found by poor Lake did not enter into these guesses, for\\ntheir geologic setting proved them to have lived at what must have been\\na very early date in the land city\\'s history. They were, according to\\ntheir location, certainly not less than thirty million years old, and\\nwe reflected that in their day the sea-cavern city, and indeed the\\ncavern itself, had had no existence.\\n\\nThey would have remembered an older scene, with lush Tertiary\\nvegetation everywhere, a younger land city of flourishing arts around\\nthem, and a great river sweeping northward along the base of the mighty\\nmountains toward a far-away tropic ocean.\\n\\nAnd yet we could not help thinking about these specimensâ\\x80\\x94especially\\nabout the eight perfect ones that were missing from Lake\\'s hideously\\nravaged camp. There was something abnormal about that whole\\nbusinessâ\\x80\\x94the strange things we had tried so hard to lay to somebody\\'s\\nmadnessâ\\x80\\x94those frightful gravesâ\\x80\\x94the amount and nature of the\\nmissing materialâ\\x80\\x94Gedneyâ\\x80\\x94the unearthly toughness of those archaic\\nmonstrosities, and the queer vital freaks the sculptures now showed\\nthe race to haveâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94Danforth and I had seen a good deal in the last\\nfew hours, and were prepared to believe and keep silent about many\\nappalling and incredible secrets of primal nature.\\n\\nIX.\\n\\nI have said that our study of the decadent sculptures brought about a\\nchange in our immediate objective. This, of course, had to do with the\\nchiseled avenues to the black inner world, of whose existence we had\\nnot known before, but which we were now eager to find and traverse.\\n\\nFrom the evident scale of the carvings we deduced that a steeply\\ndescending walk of about a mile through either of the neighboring\\ntunnels would bring us to the brink of the dizzy, sunless cliffs about\\nthe great abyss, down whose side paths, improved by the Old Ones, led\\nto the rocky shore of the hidden and nighted ocean. To behold this\\nfabulous gulf in stark reality was a lure which seemed impossible of\\nresistance once we knew of the thingâ\\x80\\x94yet we realized we must begin the\\nquest at once if we expected to include it in our present trip.\\n\\nIn was now eight p.m., and we had not enough battery replacements to\\nlet our torches burn on forever. We had done so much of our studying\\nand copying below the glacial level that our battery supply had had at\\nleast five hours of nearly continuous use, and despite the special dry\\ncell formula would obviously be good for only about four moreâ\\x80\\x94though\\nby keeping one torch unused, except for especially interesting or\\ndifficult places, we might manage to eke out a safe margin beyond that.\\n\\nIt would not do to be without a light in these Cyclopean catacombs,\\nhence in order to make the abyss trip we must give up all further\\nmural deciphering. Of course, we intended to revisit the place for days\\nand perhaps weeks of intensive study and photographyâ\\x80\\x94curiosity having\\nlong ago gotten the better of horrorâ\\x80\\x94but just now we must hasten.\\n\\nOur supply of trail-blazing paper was far from unlimited, and we were\\nreluctant to sacrifice spare notebooks or sketching paper to augment\\nit, but we did let one large notebook go. If worst came to worst, we\\ncould resort to rock chippingâ\\x80\\x94and, of course, it would be possible,\\neven in case of really lost direction, to work up to full daylight by\\none channel or another if granted sufficient time for plentiful trial\\nand error. So, at last, we set off eagerly in the indicated direction\\nof the nearest tunnel.\\n\\nAccording to the carvings from which we had made our map, the desired\\ntunnel mouth could not be much more than a quarter of a mile from where\\nwe stood; the intervening space showing solid-looking buildings quite\\nlikely to be penetrable still at a subglacial level. The opening itself\\nwould be in the basementâ\\x80\\x94on the angle nearest the foothillsâ\\x80\\x94of a\\nvast five-pointed structure of evidently public and perhaps ceremonial\\nnature, which we tried to identify from our aÃ«rial survey of the ruins.\\n\\nNo such structure came to our minds as we recalled our flight, hence we\\nconcluded that its upper parts had been greatly damaged, or that it had\\nbeen totally shattered in an ice rift we had noticed. In the latter\\ncase the tunnel would probably turn out to be choked, so that we would\\nhave to try the next nearest oneâ\\x80\\x94the one less than a mile to the north.\\n\\nThe intervening river course prevented our trying any of the more\\nsouthern tunnels on this trip; and indeed, if both of the neighboring\\nones were choked it was doubtful whether our batteries would warrant\\nan attempt on the next northerly oneâ\\x80\\x94about a mile beyond our second\\nchoice.\\n\\nAs we threaded our dim way through the labyrinth with the aid of map\\nand compassâ\\x80\\x94traversing rooms and corridors in every stage of ruin or\\npreservation, clambering up ramps, crossing upper floors and bridges\\nand clambering down again, encountering choked doorways and piles of\\ndÃ©bris, hastening now and then along finely preserved and uncannily\\nimmaculate stretches, taking false leads and retracing our way (in such\\ncases removing the blind paper trail we had left), and once in a while\\nstriking the bottom of an open shaft through which daylight poured or\\ntrickled downâ\\x80\\x94we were repeatedly tantalized by the sculptured walls\\nalong our route.\\n\\nWe had wormed our way very close to the computed site of the tunnel\\'s\\nmouthâ\\x80\\x94having crossed a second-story bridge to what seemed plainly the\\ntip of a pointed wall, and descended to a ruinous corridor especially\\nrich in decadently elaborate and apparently ritualistic sculptures of\\nlate workmanshipâ\\x80\\x94when, about eight thirty p.m., Danforth\\'s keen young\\nnostrils gave us the first hint of something unusual.\\n\\nIf we had had a dog with us, I suppost we would have been warned\\nbefore. At first we could not precisely say what was wrong with the\\nformerly crystal-pure air, but after a few seconds our memories reached\\nonly too definitely. Let me try to state the thing without flinching.\\nThere was an odorâ\\x80\\x94and that odor was vaguely, subtly, and unmistakably\\nakin to what had nauseated us upon opening the insane grave of the\\nhorror poor Lake had dissected.\\n\\nOf course, the revelation was not as clearly cut at the time as it\\nsounds now. There were several conceivable explanations, and we did a\\ngood deal of indecisive whispering. Most important of all, we did not\\nretreat without further investigation; for having come this far, we\\nwere loath to be balked by anything short of certain disaster.\\n\\nAnyway, what we must have suspected was altogether too wild to believe.\\nSuch things did not happen in any normal world. It was probably sheer\\nirrational instinct which made us dim our single torchâ\\x80\\x94tempted no\\nlonger by the decadent and sinister sculptures that leered menacingly\\nfrom the oppressive wallsâ\\x80\\x94and which softened our progress to a\\ncautious tiptoeing and crawling over the increasingly littered floor\\nand heaps of dÃ©bris.\\n\\nDanforth\\'s eyes as well as nose proved better than mine, for it was\\nlikewise he who first noticed the queer aspect of the dÃ©bris after we\\nhad passed many half-choked arches leading to chambers and corridors\\non the ground level. It did not look quite as it ought after countless\\nthousands of years of desertion, and when we cautiously turned on more\\nlight we saw that a kind of swath seemed to have been lately tracked\\nthrough it. The irregular nature of the latter precluded any definite\\nmarks, but in the smoother places there were suggestions of the\\ndragging of heavy objects. Once we thought there was a hint of parallel\\ntracks, as if of runners. This was what made us pause again.\\n\\nIt was during that pause that we caughtâ\\x80\\x94simultaneously this timeâ\\x80\\x94the\\nother odor ahead. Paradoxically, it was both a less frightful and a\\nmore frightful odorâ\\x80\\x94less frightful intrinsically, but infinitely\\nappalling in this place under the known circumstancesâ\\x80\\x94unless, of\\ncourse, Gedneyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94For the odor was the plain and familiar one of common\\npetrolâ\\x80\\x94every-day gasoline.\\n\\nOur motivation after that is something I will leave to psychologists.\\nWe knew now that some terrible extension of the camp horrors must\\nhave crawled into this nighted burial place of the Ã¦ons, hence could\\nnot doubt any longer the existence of nameless conditionsâ\\x80\\x94present\\nor at least recentâ\\x80\\x94just ahead. Yet in the end we did let sheer\\nburning curiosityâ\\x80\\x94or anxietyâ\\x80\\x94or autohypnotismâ\\x80\\x94or vague thoughts of\\nresponsibility toward Gedneyâ\\x80\\x94of what notâ\\x80\\x94drive us on.\\n\\nDanforth whispered again of the print he thought he had seen at\\nthe alley turning in the ruins above; and of the faint musical\\npipingâ\\x80\\x94potentially of tremendous significance in the light of Lake\\'s\\ndissection report, despite its close resemblance to the cave-mouth\\nechoes of the windy peaksâ\\x80\\x94which he thought he had shortly afterward\\nhalf heard from unknown depths below.\\n\\nI, in my turn, whispered of how the camp was leftâ\\x80\\x94of what had\\ndisappeared, and of how the madness of a lone survivor might have\\nconceived the inconceivableâ\\x80\\x94a wild trip across the monstrous mountains\\nand a descent into the unknown, primal masonryâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94\\n\\nBut we could not convince each other, or even ourselves, of anything\\ndefinite. We had turned off all light as we stood still, and vaguely\\nnoticed that a trace of deeply filtered upper daylight kept the\\nblackness from being absolute.\\n\\nHaving automatically begun to move ahead, we guided ourselves by\\noccasional flashes from our torch. The disturbed dÃ©bris formed an\\nimpression we could not shake off, and the smell of gasoline grew\\nstronger. More and more ruin met our eyes and hampered our feet, until\\nvery soon we saw that the forward way was about to cease. We had been\\nall too correct in our pessimistic guess about that rift glimpsed from\\nthe air. Our tunnel quest was a blind one, and we were not even going\\nto be able to reach the basement out of which the abyssward aperture\\nopened.\\n\\nThe torch, flashing over the grotesquely carved walls of the blocked\\ncorridor in which we stood, showed several doorways in various\\nstates of obstruction; and from one of them the gasoline odorâ\\x80\\x94quite\\nsubmerging that other hint of odorâ\\x80\\x94came with especial distinctness. As\\nwe looked more steadily, we saw that beyond a doubt there had been a\\nslight and recent clearing away of dÃ©bris from that particular opening.\\nWhatever the lurking horror might be, we believed the direct avenue\\ntoward it was now plainly manifest. I do not think any one will wonder\\nthat we waited an appreciable time before making any further motion.\\n\\nAnd yet, when we did venture inside that black arch, our first\\nimpression was one of anticlimax. For amidst the littered expanse\\nof that sculptured cryptâ\\x80\\x94a perfect cube with sides of about twenty\\nfeetâ\\x80\\x94there remained no recent object of instantly discernible size; so\\nthat we looked instinctively, though in vain, for a farther doorway.\\n\\nIn another moment, however, Danforth\\'s sharp vision had discovered a\\nplace where the floor dÃ©bris had been disturbed. We turned on both\\ntorches full strength. Though what we saw in that light was actually\\nsimple and trifling, I am none the less reluctant to tell of it because\\nof what it implied.\\n\\nIt was a rough leveling of the dÃ©bris, upon which several small objects\\nlay carelessly scattered, and at one corner of which a considerable\\namount of gasoline must have been spilled lately enough to leave a\\nstrong odor even at this extreme superplateau altitude. In other words,\\nit could not be other than a sort of campâ\\x80\\x94a camp made by questing\\nbeings who, like us, had been turned back by the unexpectedly choked\\nway to the abyss.\\n\\nLet me be plain. The scattered objects were, so far as substance was\\nconcerned, all from Lake\\'s camp, and consisted of: tin cans as queerly\\nopened as those we had seen at that ravaged place, many spent matches,\\nthree illustrated books more or less curiously smudged, an empty ink\\nbottle with its pictorial and instructional carton, a broken fountain\\npen, some oddly snipped fragments of fur and tent cloth, a used\\nelectric battery with circular of directions, a folder that came with\\nour type of tent heater, and a sprinkling of crumpled papers.\\n\\nIt was all bad enough, but when we smoothed out the papers and looked\\nat what was on them we felt we had come to the worst. We had found\\ncertain inexplicably blotted papers at the camp which might have\\nprepared us, yet the effect of the sight, down there in the prehuman\\nvaults of a nightmare city, was almost too much to bear.\\n\\nA mad Gedney might have made the groups of dots in imitation of\\nthose found on the greenish soapstones, just as the dots on those\\ninsane five-pointed grave mounds might have been made; and he might\\nconceivably have prepared rough, hasty sketchesâ\\x80\\x94varying in their\\naccuracyâ\\x80\\x94or lack of itâ\\x80\\x94which outlined the neighboring parts of the\\ncity and traced the way from a circularly represented place outside\\nour previous routeâ\\x80\\x94a place we identified as a great cylindrical tower\\nin the carvings and as a vast circular gulf glimpsed in our aÃ«rial\\nsurveyâ\\x80\\x94to the present five-pointed structure and the tunnel mouth\\ntherein.\\n\\nHe might, I repeat, have prepared such sketches; for those before\\nus were quite obviously compiled, as our own had been, from late\\nsculptures somewhere in the glacial labyrinth, though not from the\\nones which we had seen and used. But what this art-blind bungler could\\nnever have done was to execute those sketches in a strange and assured\\ntechnique perhaps superior, despite haste and carelessness, to any of\\nthe decadent carvings from which they were takenâ\\x80\\x94the characteristic\\nand unmistakable technique of the Old Ones themselves in the dead\\ncity\\'s heyday.\\n\\nThere are those who will say Danforth and I were utterly mad not\\nto flee for our lives after that; since our conclusions were\\nnowâ\\x80\\x94notwithstanding their wildnessâ\\x80\\x94completely fixed, and of a nature\\nI need not even mention to those who have read my account as far as\\nthis. Perhaps we were madâ\\x80\\x94for have I not said those horrible peaks\\nwere mountains of madness? But I think I can detect something of the\\nsame spiritâ\\x80\\x94albeit in a less extreme formâ\\x80\\x94in the men who stalk\\ndeadly beasts through African jungles to photograph them or study\\ntheir habits. Half paralyzed with terror though we were, there was\\nnevertheless fanned within us a blazing flame of awe and curiosity\\nwhich triumphed in the end.\\n\\nOf course, we did not mean to face thatâ\\x80\\x94or thoseâ\\x80\\x94which we knew had\\nbeen there, but we felt that they must be gone by now. They would by\\nthis time have found the other neighboring entrance to the abyss, and\\nhave passed within, to whatever night-black fragments of the past might\\nawait them in the ultimate gulfâ\\x80\\x94the ultimate gulf they had never seen.\\nOr if that entrance, too, was blocked, they would have gone on to the\\nnorth seeking another. They were, we remembered, partly independent of\\nlight.\\n\\nLooking back to that moment, I can scarcely recall just what precise\\nform our new emotions tookâ\\x80\\x94just what change of immediate objective it\\nwas that so sharpened our sense of expectancy. We certainly did not\\nmean to face what we fearedâ\\x80\\x94yet I will not deny that we may have had\\na lurking, unconscious wish to spy certain things from some hidden\\nvantage point.\\n\\nProbably we had not given up our zeal to glimpse the abyss itself,\\nthough there was interposed a new goal in the form of that great\\ncircular place shown on the crumpled sketches we had found. We had at\\nonce recognized it as a monstrous cylindrical tower in the carvings,\\nbut appearing only as a prodigious, round aperture from above.\\n\\nSomething about the impressiveness of its rendering, even in these\\nhasty diagrams, made us think that its subglacial levels must\\nstill form a feature of peculiar importance. Perhaps it embodied\\narchitectural marvels as yet unencountered by us. It was certainly of\\nincredible age, according to the sculptures in which it figuredâ\\x80\\x94being\\nindeed among the first things built in the city. Its carvings, if\\npreserved, could not but be highly significant. Moreover, it might form\\na good present link with the upper worldâ\\x80\\x94a shorter route than the one\\nwe were so carefully blazing and probably that by which those others\\nhad descended.\\n\\nAt any rate, the thing we did was to study the terrible sketchesâ\\x80\\x94which\\nquite perfectly confirmed our ownâ\\x80\\x94and start back over the indicated\\ncourse to the circular place; the course which our nameless\\npredecessors must have traversed twice before us. The other neighboring\\ngate to the abyss would lie beyond that. I need not speak of our\\njourneyâ\\x80\\x94during which we continued to leave an economical trail of\\npaperâ\\x80\\x94for it was precisely the same in kind as that by which we had\\nreached the cul-de-sac, except that it tended to adhere more closely to\\nthe ground level and even descend to basement corridors.\\n\\nEvery now and then we could trace certain disturbing marks\\nin the dÃ©bris or litter underfoot; and, after we had passed\\noutside the radius of the gasoline scent, we were again faintly\\nconsciousâ\\x80\\x94spasmodicallyâ\\x80\\x94of that more hideous and more persistent\\nscent. After the way had branched from our former course, we sometimes\\ngave the rays of our single torch a furtive sweep along the walls;\\nnoting in almost every case the well-nigh omnipresent sculptures, which\\nindeed seem to have formed a main Ã¦sthetic outlet for the Old Ones.\\n\\nAbout nine-thirty p.m., while traversing a vaulted corridor whose\\nincreasingly glaciated floor seemed somewhat below the ground level and\\nwhose roof grew lower as we advanced, we began to see strong daylight\\nahead and were able to turn off our torch. It appeared that we were\\ncoming to the vast, circular place, and that our distance from the\\nupper air could not be very great.\\n\\nThe corridor ended in an arch, surprisingly low for these megalithic\\nruins, but we could see much through it even before we emerged. Beyond,\\nthere stretched a prodigious round spaceâ\\x80\\x94fully two hundred feet in\\ndiameterâ\\x80\\x94strewn with dÃ©bris and containing many choked archways\\ncorresponding to the one we were about to cross. The walls wereâ\\x80\\x94in\\navailable spacesâ\\x80\\x94boldly sculptured into a spiral band of heroic\\nproportions; and displayed, despite the destructive weathering caused\\nby the openness of the spot, an artistic splendor far beyond anything\\nwe had encountered before. The littered floor was quite heavily\\nglaciated, and we fancied that the true bottom lay at a considerably\\nlower depth.\\n\\nBut the salient object of the place was the titanic stone ramp which,\\neluding the archways by a sharp turn outward into the open floor, wound\\nspirally up the stupendous cylindrical wall like an inside counterpart\\nof those once climbing outside the monstrous towers or zikkurats of\\nantique Babylon. Only the rapidity of our flight, and the perspective\\nwhich confounded the descent with the tower\\'s inner wall, had\\nprevented our noticing this feature from the air, and thus caused us to\\nseek another avenue to the subglacial level.\\n\\nPabodie might have been able to tell what sort of engineering held it\\nin place, but Danforth and I could merely admire and marvel. We could\\nsee mighty stone corbels and pillars here and there, but what we saw\\nseemed inadequate to the function performed. The thing was excellently\\npreserved up to the present top of the towerâ\\x80\\x94a highly remarkable\\ncircumstance in view of its exposureâ\\x80\\x94and its shelter had done much to\\nprotect the bizarre and disturbing cosmic sculptures on the walls.\\n\\nAs we stepped out into the awesome half daylight of this monstrous\\ncylinder bottomâ\\x80\\x94fifty million years old, and without doubt the most\\nprimally ancient structure ever to meet our eyesâ\\x80\\x94we saw that the\\nramp-traversed sides stretched dizzily up to a height of fully sixty\\nfeet.\\n\\nThis, we recalled from our aÃ«rial survey, meant an outside glaciation\\nof some forty feet; since the yawning gulf we had seen from the plane\\nhad been at the top of an approximately twenty-foot mound of crumbled\\nmasonry, somewhat sheltered for three fourths of its circumference by\\nthe massive curving walls of a line of higher ruins. According to the\\nsculptures the original tower had stood in the center of an immense\\ncircular plaza, and had been perhaps five hundred or six hundred\\nfeet high, with tiers of horizontal disks near the top, and a row of\\nneedlelike spires along the upper rim.\\n\\nMost of the masonry had obviously toppled outward rather than inwardâ\\x80\\x94a\\nfortunate happening, since otherwise the ramp might have been shattered\\nand the whole interior choked. As it was, the ramp showed sad\\nbattering; whilst the choking was such that all the archways seemed to\\nhave been half cleared.\\n\\nIt took us only a moment to conclude that this was indeed the route by\\nwhich those others had descended, and that this would be the logical\\nroute for our own ascent, despite the long trail of paper we had left\\nelsewhere. The tower\\'s mouth was no farther from the foothills and our\\nwaiting plane than was the great terraced building we had entered, and\\nany further subglacial exploration we might make on this trip would lie\\nin this general region.\\n\\nOddly, we were still thinking about possible later tripsâ\\x80\\x94even after\\nall we had seen and guessed. Then, as we picked our way cautiously over\\nthe dÃ©bris of the great floor, there came a sight which for the time\\nexcluded all other matters.\\n\\nIt was the neatly huddled array of three sledges in that farther angle\\nof the ramp\\'s lower and outward-projecting course which had hitherto\\nbeen screened from our view. There they wereâ\\x80\\x94the three sledges missing\\nfrom Lake\\'s campâ\\x80\\x94shaken by a hard usage which must have included\\nforcible dragging along great reaches of snowless masonry and dÃ©bris,\\nas well as much hand portage over utterly unnavigable places.\\n\\nThey were carefully and intelligently packed and strapped, and\\ncontained things memorably familiar enough: the gasoline stove, fuel\\ncans, instrument cases, provision tins, tarpaulins obviously bulging\\nwith books, and some bulging with less obvious contentsâ\\x80\\x94everything\\nderived from Lake\\'s equipment.\\n\\nAfter what we had found in that other room, we were in a measure\\nprepared for this encounter. The really great shock came when we\\nstepped over and undid one tarpaulin, whose outlines had peculiarly\\ndisquieted us. It seems that others as well as Lake had been interested\\nin collecting typical specimens; for there were two here, both stiffly\\nfrozen, perfectly preserved, patched with adhesive plaster where some\\nwounds around the neck had occurred, and wrapped with care to prevent\\nfurther damage. They were the bodies of young Gedney and the missing\\ndog.\\n\\nX.\\n\\nMany people will probably judge us callous as well as mad for thinking\\nabout the northward tunnel and the abyss so soon after our somber\\ndiscovery, and I am not prepared to say that we would have immediately\\nrevived such thoughts but for a specific circumstance which broke in\\nupon us and set up a whole new train of speculations.\\n\\nWe had replaced the tarpaulin over poor Gedney and were standing\\nin a kind of mute bewilderment when the sounds finally reached our\\nconsciousnessâ\\x80\\x94the first sounds we had heard since descending out of\\nthe open where the mountain wind whined faintly from its unearthly\\nheights. Well-known and mundane though they were, their presence in\\nthis remote world of death was more unexpected and unnerving than any\\ngrotesque or fabulous tones could possibly have beenâ\\x80\\x94since they gave a\\nfresh upsetting to all our notions of cosmic harmony.\\n\\nHad it been some trace of that bizarre musical piping over a wide\\nrange, which Lake\\'s dissection report had led us to expect in those\\nothersâ\\x80\\x94and which, indeed, our overwrought fancies had been reading\\ninto every wind howl we had heard since coming on the camp horrorâ\\x80\\x94it\\nwould have had a kind of hellish congruity with the Ã¦on-dead region\\naround us. A voice from other epochs belongs in a graveyard of other\\nepochs.\\n\\nAs it was, however, the noise shattered all our profoundly seated\\nadjustmentsâ\\x80\\x94all out tacit acceptance of the inner antarctic as a waste\\nutterly and irrevocably void of every vestige of normal life.\\n\\nWhat we heard was not the fabulous note of any buried blasphemy of\\nelder earth from whose supernal toughness an age-denied polar sun had\\nevoked a monstrous response. Instead, it was a thing so mockingly\\nnormal and so unerringly familiarized by our sea days off Victoria Land\\nand our camp days at McMurdo Sound that we shuddered to think of it\\nhere, where such things ought not to be. To be briefâ\\x80\\x94it was simply the\\nraucous squawking of a penguin.\\n\\nThe muffled sound floated from subglacial recesses nearly opposite to\\nthe corridor whence we had comeâ\\x80\\x94regions manifestly in the direction\\nof that other tunnel to the vast abyss. The presence of a living water\\nbird in such a directionâ\\x80\\x94in a world whose surface was one of age-long\\nand uniform lifelessnessâ\\x80\\x94could lead to only one conclusion; hence our\\nfirst thought was to verify the objective reality of the sound. It was,\\nindeed, repeated, and seemed at times to come from more than one throat.\\n\\nSeeking its source, we entered an archway from which much dÃ©bris had\\nbeen cleared; resuming our trail blazingâ\\x80\\x94with an added paper supply\\ntaken with curious repugnance from one of the tarpaulin bundles on the\\nsledgesâ\\x80\\x94when we left daylight behind.\\n\\nAs the glaciated floor gave place to a litter of detritus, we plainly\\ndiscerned some curious, dragging tracks; and once Danforth found\\na distinct print of a sort whose description would be only too\\nsuperfluous. The course indicated by the penguin cries was precisely\\nwhat our map and compass prescribed as an approach to the more\\nnortherly tunnel mouth, and we were glad to find that a bridgeless\\nthoroughfare on the ground and basement levels seemed open.\\n\\nThe tunnel, according to the chart, ought to start from the basement of\\na large pyramidal structure which we seemed vaguely to recall from our\\naÃ«rial survey as remarkably well-preserved. Along our path the single\\ntorch showed a customary profusion of carvings, but we did not pause to\\nexamine any of these.\\n\\nSuddenly a bulky white shape loomed up ahead of us, and we flashed on\\nthe second torch. It is odd how wholly this new quest had turned our\\nminds from earlier fears of what might lurk near. Those other ones,\\nhaving left their supplies in the great circular place, must have\\nplanned to return after their scouting trip toward or into the abyss;\\nyet we had now discarded all caution concerning them as completely as\\nif they had never existed.\\n\\nThis white, waddling thing was fully six feet high, yet we seemed to\\nrealize at once that it was not one of those others. They were larger\\nand dark, and, according to the sculptures, their motion over land\\nsurfaces was a swift, assured matter despite the queerness of their\\nsea-born tentacle equipment. But to say that the white thing did not\\nprofoundly frighten us would be vain. We were indeed clutched for an\\ninstant by a primitive dread almost sharper than the worst of our\\nreasoned fears regarding those others.\\n\\nThen came a flash of anticlimax as the white shape sidled into a\\nlateral archway to our left, to join two others of its kind which\\nhad summoned it in raucous tones. For it was only a penguinâ\\x80\\x94albeit\\nof a huge, unknown species larger than the greatest of the known\\nking penguins, and monstrous in its combined albinism and virtual\\neyelessness.\\n\\nWhen we had followed the thing into the archway and turned both our\\ntorches on the indifferent and unheeding group of three, we saw that\\nthey were all eyeless albinos of the same unknown and gigantic species.\\n\\nTheir size reminded us of some of the archaic penguins depicted in the\\nOld Ones\\' sculptures, and it did not take us long to conclude that\\nthey were descended from the same stockâ\\x80\\x94undoubtedly surviving through\\na retreat to some warmer inner region whose perpetual blackness had\\ndestroyed their pigmentation and atrophied their eyes to mere useless\\nslits.\\n\\nThat their present habitat was the vast abyss we sought, was not for a\\nmoment to be doubted; and this evidence of the gulf\\'s continued warmth\\nand habitability filled us with the most curious and subtly perturbing\\nfancies.\\n\\nWe wondered, too, what had caused these three birds to venture out\\nof their usual domain. The state and silence of the great dead city\\nmade it clear that it had at no time been a habitual seasonal rookery,\\nwhilst the manifest indifference of the trio to our presence made it\\nseem odd that any passing party of those others should have startled\\nthem.\\n\\nWas it possible that those others had taken some aggressive notion or\\ntried to increase their meat supply? We doubted whether that pungent\\nodor which the dogs had hated could cause an equal antipathy in these\\npenguins; since their ancestors had obviously lived on excellent terms\\nwith the Old Onesâ\\x80\\x94an amicable relationship which must have survived in\\nthe abyss below as long as any of the Old Ones remained.\\n\\nRegrettingâ\\x80\\x94in a flare-up of the old spirit of pure scienceâ\\x80\\x94that we\\ncould not photograph these anomalous creatures, we shortly left them\\nto their squawking and pushed on toward the abyss whose openness was\\nnow so positively proved to us, and whose exact direction occasional\\npenguin tracks made clear.\\n\\nNot long afterward a steep descent in a long, low, doorless, and\\npeculiarly sculptureless corridor led us to believe that we were\\napproaching the tunnel mouth at last. We had passed two more penguins.\\n\\nThen the corridor ended in a prodigious open space which made us\\ngasp involuntarilyâ\\x80\\x94a perfect inverted hemisphere, obviously deep\\nunderground, fully a hundred feet in diameter and fifty feet high, with\\nlow archways opening around all parts of the circumference but one, and\\nthat one yawning cavernously with a black, arched aperture which broke\\nthe symmetry of the vault to a height of nearly fifteen feet. It was\\nthe entrance to the great abyss.\\n\\nIn this vast hemisphere, whose concave roof was impressively though\\ndecadently carved to a likeness of the primordial celestial dome, a few\\nalbino penguins waddledâ\\x80\\x94aliens there, but indifferent and unseeing.\\nThe black tunnel yawned indefinitely off at a steep, descending grade,\\nits aperture adorned with grotesquely chiseled jambs and lintel.\\n\\nFrom that cryptical mouth we fancied a current of slightly warmer air\\nand perhaps even a suspicion of vapor proceeded; and we wondered what\\nliving entities other than penguins the limitless void below, and the\\ncontiguous honeycombings of the land and the titan mountains, might\\nconceal.\\n\\nWe wondered, too, whether the trace of mountaintop smoke at first\\nsuspected by poor Lake, as well as the odd haze we had ourselves\\nperceived around the rampart-crowned peak, might not be caused by\\nthe tortuous-channeled rising of some such vapor from the unfathomed\\nregions of earth\\'s core.\\n\\nEntering the tunnel, we saw that its outline wasâ\\x80\\x94at least at the\\nstartâ\\x80\\x94about fifteen feet each wayâ\\x80\\x94sides, floor, and arched roof\\ncomposed of the usual megalithic masonry. The sides were sparsely\\ndecorated with cartouches of conventional designs in a later, decadent\\nstyle; and all the construction and carving were marvellously\\nwell-preserved.\\n\\nThe floor was quite clear, except for a slight detritus bearing\\noutgoing penguin tracks and the inward tracks of those others. The\\nfarther one advanced, the warmer it became; so that we were soon\\nunbuttoning our heavy garments. We wondered whether there were any\\nactually igneous manifestations below, and whether the waters of that\\nsunless sea were hot.\\n\\nAfter a short distance the masonry gave place to solid rock, though\\nthe tunnel kept the same proportions and presented the same aspect of\\ncarved regularity. Occasionally its varying grade became so steep that\\ngrooves were cut in the floor.\\n\\nSeveral times we noted the mouths of small lateral galleries not\\nrecorded in our diagrams; none of them such as to complicate the\\nproblem of our return, and all of them welcome as possible refuges in\\ncase we met unwelcome entities on their way back from the abyss.\\n\\nThe nameless scent of such things was very distinct. Doubtless it\\nwas suicidally foolish to venture into that tunnel under the known\\nconditions, but the lure of the unplumbed is stronger in certain\\npersons than most suspectâ\\x80\\x94indeed, it was just such a lure which had\\nbrought us to this unearthly polar waste in the first place.\\n\\nWe saw several penguins as we passed along, and speculated on the\\ndistance we would have to traverse. The carvings had led us to expect\\na steep downhill walk of about a mile to the abyss, but our previous\\nwanderings had shown us that matters of scale were not wholly to be\\ndepended on.\\n\\nAfter about a quarter of a mile that nameless scent became greatly\\naccentuated, and we kept very careful track of the various lateral\\nopenings we passed. There was no visible vapor as at the mouth, but\\nthis was doubtless due to the lack of contrasting cooler air. The\\ntemperature was rapidly ascending, and we were not surprised to come\\nupon a careless heap of material shudderingly familiar to us. It was\\ncomposed of furs and tent cloths taken from Lake\\'s camp, and we did\\nnot pause to study the bizarre forms into which the fabrics had been\\nslashed.\\n\\nSlightly beyond this point we noticed a decided increase in the size\\nand number of the side galleries, and concluded that the densely\\nhoneycombed region beneath the higher foothills must now have been\\nreached.\\n\\nThe nameless scent was now curiously mixed with another and scarcely\\nless offensive odorâ\\x80\\x94of what nature we could not guess, though we\\nthought of decaying organisms and perhaps unknown subterrane fungi.\\n\\nThen came a startling expansion of the tunnel for which the\\ncarvings had not prepared usâ\\x80\\x94a broadening and rising into a lofty,\\nnatural-looking elliptical cavern with a level floor, some seventy-five\\nfeet long and fifty broad, and with many immense side passages leading\\naway into cryptical darkness.\\n\\nThough this cavern was natural in appearance, an inspection with both\\ntorches suggested that it had been formed by the artificial destruction\\nof several walls between adjacent honeycombings. The walls were\\nrough, and the high, vaulted roof was thick with stalactites; but the\\nsolid rock floor had been smoothed off, and was free from all dÃ©bris,\\ndetritus, or even dust to a positively abnormal extent.\\n\\nExcept for the avenue through which we had come, this was true of\\nthe floors of all the great galleries opening off from it; and the\\nsingularity of the condition was such as to set us vainly puzzling.\\n\\nThe curious new fetor which had supplemented the nameless scent was\\nexcessively pungent here; so much so that it destroyed all trace of the\\nother. Something about this whole place, with its polished and almost\\nglistening floor, struck us as more vaguely baffling and horrible than\\nany of the monstrous things we have previously encountered.\\n\\nThe regularity of the passage immediately ahead, prevented all\\nconfusion as to the right course amidst this plethora of equally great\\ncave mouths. Nevertheless we resolved to resume our paper trail blazing\\nif any further complexity should develop; for dust tracks, of course,\\ncould no longer be expected.\\n\\nUpon resuming our direct progress we cast a beam of torchlight over the\\ntunnel wallsâ\\x80\\x94and stopped short in amazement at the supremely radical\\nchange which had come over the carvings in this part of the passage.\\nWe realized, of course, the great decadence of the Old Ones\\' sculpture\\nat the time of the tunneling, and had indeed noticed the inferior\\nworkmanship of the arabesques in the stretches behind us.\\n\\nBut now, in this deeper section beyond the cavern, there was a sudden\\ndifference wholly transcending explanationâ\\x80\\x94a difference in basic\\nnature as well as in mere quality, and involving so profound and\\ncalamitous a degradation of skill that nothing in the hitherto observed\\nrate of decline could have led one to expect it.\\n\\nThis new and degenerate work was coarse, bold, and wholly lacking in\\ndelicacy of detail. It was countersunk with exaggerated depth in bands\\nfollowing the same general line as the sparse cartouches of the earlier\\nsections, but the height of the reliefs did not reach the level of the\\ngeneral surface.\\n\\nDanforth had the idea that it was a second carvingâ\\x80\\x94a sort of\\npalimpsest formed after the obliteration of a previous design. In\\nnature it was wholly decorative and conventional, and consisted of\\ncrude spirals and angles roughly following the quintile mathematical\\ntradition of the Old Ones, yet seeming more like a parody than a\\nperpetuation of that tradition.\\n\\nSince we could not afford to spend any considerable time in study, we\\nresumed our advance after a cursory look.\\n\\nWe saw and heard fewer penguins, but thought we caught a vague\\nsuspicion of an infinitely distant chorus of them somewhere deep within\\nthe earth. The new and inexplicable odor was abominably strong, and we\\ncould detect scarcely a sign of that other nameless scent.\\n\\nPuffs of visible vapor ahead bespoke increasing contrasts in\\ntemperature, and the relative nearness of the sunless sea cliffs of the\\ngreat abyss. Then, quite unexpectedly, we saw certain obstructions on\\nthe polished floor aheadâ\\x80\\x94obstructions which were quite definitely not\\npenguinsâ\\x80\\x94and turned on our second torch after making sure that the\\nobjects were quite stationary.\\n\\nXI.\\n\\nStill another time have I come to a place where it is very difficult\\nto proceed. I ought to be hardened by this stage; but there are some\\nexperiences and intimations which scar too deeply to permit of healing,\\nand leave only such added sensitiveness that memory re-inspired all the\\noriginal horror.\\n\\nWe saw, as I have said, certain obstructions on the polished\\nfloor ahead; and I may add that our nostrils were assailed almost\\nsimultaneously by a very curious intensification of the strange,\\nprevailing fetor, now quite plainly mixed with the nameless stench of\\nthose others which had gone before us.\\n\\nThe light of the second torch left no doubt of what the obstructions\\nwere, and we dared approach them only because we could see, even from\\na distance, that they were quite as past all harming power as had been\\nthe six similar specimens unearthed from the monstrous star-mounded\\ngraves at poor Lake\\'s camp.\\n\\nThey were, indeed, as lacking in completeness as most of those we\\nhad unearthedâ\\x80\\x94though it grew plain from the thick, dark-green pool\\ngathering around them that their incompleteness was of infinitely\\ngreater recency. There seemed to be only four of them, whereas Lake\\'s\\nbulletins would have suggested no less than eight as forming the\\ngroup which had preceded us. To find them in this state was wholly\\nunexpected, and we wondered what sort of monstrous struggle had\\noccurred down here in the dark.\\n\\nPenguins, attacked in a body, retaliate savagely with their beaks; and\\nour ears now made certain the existence of a rookery far beyond. Had\\nthose others disturbed such a place and aroused murderous pursuit? The\\nobstructions did not suggest it, for penguin beaks against the tough\\ntissues Lake had dissected could hardly account for the terrible damage\\nour approaching glance was beginning to make out. Besides, the huge\\nblind birds we had seen appeared to be singularly peaceful.\\n\\nHad there, then, been a struggle among those others, and were the\\nabsent four responsible? If so, where were they? Were they close at\\nhand and likely to form an immediate menace to us? We glanced anxiously\\nat some of the smooth-floored lateral passages as we continued our slow\\nand frankly reluctant approach.\\n\\nWhatever the conflict was, it had clearly been that which had\\nfrightened the penguins into their unaccustomed wandering. It must,\\nthen, have arisen near that faintly heard rookery in the incalculable\\ngulf beyond, since there were no signs that any birds had normally\\ndwelt here.\\n\\nPerhaps, we reflected, there had been a hideous running fight, with\\nthe weaker party seeking to get back to the cached sledges when their\\npursuers finished them. One could picture the demonic fray between\\nnamelessly monstrous entities as it surged out of the black abyss with\\ngreat clouds of frantic penguins squawking and scurrying ahead.\\n\\nI say that we approached those sprawling and incomplete obstructions\\nslowly and reluctantly. Would to Heaven we had never approached them at\\nall, but had run back at top speed out of that blasphemous tunnel with\\nthe greasily smooth floors and the degenerate murals aping and mocking\\nthe things they had supersededâ\\x80\\x94run back, before we had seen what we\\ndid see, and before our minds were burned with something which will\\nnever let us breathe easily again!\\n\\nBoth of our torches were turned on the prostrate objects, so that we\\nsoon realized the dominant factor in their incompleteness. Mauled,\\ncompressed, twisted, and ruptured as they were, their chief common\\ninjury was total decapitation.\\n\\nFrom each one the tentacled starfish head had been removed; and as\\nwe drew near we saw that the manner of removal looked more like some\\nhellish tearing or suction than like any ordinary form of cleavage.\\n\\nTheir noisome dark-green ichor formed a large, spreading pool; but its\\nstench was half overshadowed by that newer and stranger stench, here\\nmore pungent than at any other point along our route.\\n\\nOnly when we had come very close to the sprawling obstructions could we\\ntrace that second, unexplainable fetor to any immediate sourceâ\\x80\\x94and the\\ninstant we did so Danforth, remembering certain very vivid sculptures\\nof the Old Ones\\' history in the Permian Age one hundred and fifty\\nmillion years ago, gave vent to a nerve-tortured cry which echoed\\nhysterically through that vaulted and archaic passage with the evil,\\npalimpsest carvings.\\n\\nI came only just short of echoing his cry myself; for I had seen those\\nprimal sculptures, too, and had shudderingly admired the way the\\nnameless artist had suggested that hideous slime coating found on\\ncertain incomplete and prostrate Old Onesâ\\x80\\x94those whom the frightful\\nShoggoths had characteristically slain and sucked to a ghastly\\nheadlessness in the great war of resubjugation.\\n\\nThey were infamous, nightmare sculptures even when telling of age-old,\\nbygone things; for Shoggoths and their work ought not to be seen by\\nhuman beings or portrayed by any beings.\\n\\nThe mad author of the Necronomicon had nervously tried to swear that\\nnone had been bred on this planet, and that only drugged dreamers\\nhad ever conceived them. Formless protoplasm able to mock and\\nreflect all forms and organs and processesâ\\x80\\x94viscous agglutinations\\nof bubbling cellsâ\\x80\\x94rubbery fifteen-foot spheroids infinitely plastic\\nand ductileâ\\x80\\x94slaves of suggestion, builders of citiesâ\\x80\\x94more and more\\nsullen, more and more intelligent, more and more amphibious, more and\\nmore imitative! Great Heaven! What madness made even those blasphemous\\nOld Ones willing to use and to carve such things?\\n\\nAnd now, when Danforth and I saw the freshly glistening and\\nreflectively iridescent black slime which clung thickly to those\\nheadless bodies and stank obscenely with that new, unknown odor whose\\ncause only a diseased fancy could envisageâ\\x80\\x94clung to those bodies\\nand sparkled less voluminously on a smooth part of the accursedly\\nresculptured wall in a series of grouped dotsâ\\x80\\x94we understood the\\nquality of cosmic fear to its uttermost depths.\\n\\nIt was not fear of those four missing othersâ\\x80\\x94for all too well did we\\nsuspect they would do no harm again. Poor devils! After all, they were\\nnot evil things of their kind. They were the men of another age and\\nanother order of being. Nature had played a hellish jest on themâ\\x80\\x94as\\nit will on any others that human madness, callousness, or cruelty may\\nhereafter drag up in that hideously dead or sleeping polar wasteâ\\x80\\x94and\\nthis was their tragic homecoming.\\n\\nThey had not been even savagesâ\\x80\\x94for what indeed had they done? That\\nawful awakening in the cold of an unknown epochâ\\x80\\x94perhaps an attack by\\nthe furry, frantically barking quadrupeds, and a dazed defense against\\nthem and the equally frantic white simians with the queer wrappings and\\nparaphernalia! Poor Lake. Poor Gedney. And poor Old Ones! Scientists\\nto the lastâ\\x80\\x94what had they done that we would not have done in their\\nplace? Lord, what intelligence and persistence! What a facing of the\\nincredible, just as those carven kinsmen and forbears had faced things\\nonly a little less incredible! Radiates, vegetables, monstrosities,\\nstar spawnâ\\x80\\x94whatever they had been, they were men!\\n\\nThey had crossed the icy peaks on whose templed slopes they had once\\nworshiped and roamed among the tree ferns. They had found their dead\\ncity brooding under its curse, and had read its carven latter days as\\nwe had done. They had tried to reach their living fellows in fabled\\ndepths of blackness they had never seenâ\\x80\\x94and what had they found?\\n\\nAll this flashed in unison through the thoughts of Danforth and me as\\nwe looked from those headless, slime-coated shapes to the loathsome\\npalimpsest sculptures and the diabolical dot groups of fresh slime on\\nthe wall beside themâ\\x80\\x94looked and understood what must have triumphed\\nand survived down there in the Cyclopean water city of that nighted,\\npenguin-fringed abyss, whence even now a sinister curling mist had\\nbegun to belch pallidly as if in answer to Danforth\\'s hysterical scream.\\n\\nThe shock of recognizing that monstrous slime and headlessness had\\nfrozen us into mute, motionless statues, and it is only through later\\nconversations that we have learned of the complete identity of our\\nthoughts at that moment.\\n\\nIt seemed Ã¦ons that we stood there, but actually it could not have been\\nmore than ten or fifteen seconds. That hateful, pallid mist curled\\nforward as if veritably driven by some remoter advancing bulkâ\\x80\\x94and then\\ncame a sound which upset much of what we had just decided, and in so\\ndoing broke the spell and enabled us to run like mad past squawking,\\nconfused penguins over our former trail back to the city, along\\nice-sunken megalithic corridors to the great open circle, and up that\\narchaic spiral ramp in a frenzied, automatic plunge for the sane outer\\nair and light of day.\\n\\nAnd then came a soundâ\\x80\\x94a horrible soundâ\\x80\\x94which enabled us to run like mad for the sane outer air â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94\\n\\nThe new sound, as I have intimated, upset much that we had decided;\\nbecause it was what poor Lake\\'s dissection had led us to attribute\\nto those we had just judged dead. It was, Danforth later told me,\\nprecisely what he had caught in infinitely muffled form when at that\\nspot beyond the alley corner above the glacial level; and it certainly\\nhad a shocking resemblance to the wind pipings we had both heard around\\nthe lofty mountain caves.\\n\\nAt the risk of seeming puerile I will add another thing, too, if\\nonly because of the surprising way Danforth\\'s impression chimed with\\nmine. Of course, common reading is what prepared us both to make the\\ninterpretation, though Danforth has hinted at queer notions about\\nunsuspected and forbidden sources to which Poe may have had access when\\nwriting his \"Arthur Gordon Pym\" a century ago.\\n\\nIt will be remembered that in that fantastic tale there is a word of\\nunknown but terrible and prodigious significance connected with the\\nantarctic and screamed eternally by the gigantic, spectrally snowy\\nbirds of that malign region\\'s core. \" Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li! \" That, I\\nmay admit, is exactly what we thought we heard conveyed by that sudden\\nsound behind the advancing white mistâ\\x80\\x94that insidious, musical piping\\nover a singularly wide range.\\n\\nWe were in full flight before three notes or syllables had been\\nuttered, though we knew that the swiftness of the Old Ones would enable\\nany scream-roused and pursuing survivor of the slaughter to overtake us\\nin a moment if it really wished to do so.\\n\\nWe had a vague hope, however, that nonaggressive conduct and a display\\nof kindred reason might cause such a being to spare us in case of\\ncapture, if only from scientific curiosity.\\n\\nAfter all, if such a one had nothing to fear for itself it would have\\nno motive in harming us. Concealment being futile at this juncture, we\\nused our torch for a running glance behind, and perceived that the mist\\nwas thinning. Would we see at last, a complete and living specimen of\\nthose others? Again came that insidious musical pipingâ\\x80\\x94\" Tekeli-li!\\nTekeli-li! \"\\n\\nThen, noting that we were actually gaining on our pursuer, it occurred\\nto us that the entity might be wounded. We could take no chances,\\nhowever, since it was very obviously approaching in answer to\\nDanforth\\'s scream, rather than in flight from any other entity. The\\ntiming was too close to admit of doubt.\\n\\nOf the whereabouts of that less conceivable and less mentionable\\nnightmareâ\\x80\\x94that fetid, unglimpsed mountain of slime-spewing protoplasm\\nwhose race had conquered the abyss and sent land pioneers to recarve\\nand squirm through the burrows of the hillsâ\\x80\\x94we could form no guess;\\nand it cost us a genuine pang to leave this probably crippled Old\\nOneâ\\x80\\x94perhaps a lone survivorâ\\x80\\x94to the peril of recapture and a nameless\\nfate.\\n\\nThank Heaven we did not slacken our run. The curling mist had thickened\\nagain, and was driving ahead with increased speed; whilst the straying\\npenguins in our rear were squawking and screaming and displaying\\nsigns of a panic really surprising in view of their relatively minor\\nconfusion when we had passed them.\\n\\nOnce more came that sinister, wide-ranged pipingâ\\x80\\x94\" Tekeli-li!\\nTekeli-li! \" We had been wrong. The thing was not wounded, but had\\nmerely paused on encountering the bodies of its fallen kindred and the\\nhellish slime inscription above them. We could never know what that\\ndemon message wasâ\\x80\\x94but those burials at Lake\\'s camp had shown how much\\nimportance the beings attached to their dead.\\n\\nOur recklessly used torch now revealed ahead of us the large open\\ncavern where various ways converged, and we were glad to be leaving\\nthose morbid palimpsest sculpturesâ\\x80\\x94almost felt even when scarcely\\nseenâ\\x80\\x94behind.\\n\\nAnother thought which the advent of the cave inspired was the\\npossibility of losing our pursuer at this bewildering focus of large\\ngalleries. There were several of the blind albino penguins in the open\\nspace, and it seemed clear that their fear of the oncoming entity was\\nextreme to the point of unaccountability.\\n\\nIf at that point we dimmed our torch to the very lowest limit of\\ntraveling need, keeping it strictly in front of us, the frightened\\nsquawking motions of the huge birds in the mist might muffle our\\nfootfalls, screen our true course, and somehow set up a false lead.\\n\\nAmidst the churning, spiraling fog, the littered and unglistening floor\\nof the main tunnel beyond this point, as differing from the other\\nmorbidly polished burrows, could hardly form a highly distinguishing\\nfeature; even, so far as we could conjecture, for those indicated\\nspecial senses which made the Old Ones partly, though imperfectly,\\nindependent of light in emergencies.\\n\\nIn fact, we were somewhat apprehensive lest we go astray ourselves\\nin our haste. For we had, of course, decided to keep straight on\\ntoward the dead city; since the consequences of loss in those unknown\\nfoothill honeycombings would be unthinkable.\\n\\nThe fact that we survived and emerged is sufficient proof that the\\nthing did take a wrong gallery whilst we providentially hit on\\nthe right one. The penguins alone could not have saved us, but in\\nconjunction with the mist they seem to have done so. Only a benign fate\\nkept the curling vapors thick enough at the right moment, for they were\\nconstantly shifting and threatening to vanish.\\n\\nIndeed, they did lift for a second just before we emerged from the\\nnauseously resculptured tunnel into the cave; so that we actually\\ncaught one first and only half glimpse of the oncoming entity as we\\ncast a final, desperately fearful glance backward before dimming the\\ntorch and mixing with the penguins in the hope of dodging pursuit. If\\nthe fate which screened us was benign, that which gave us the half\\nglimpse was infinitely the opposite; for to that flash of semivision\\ncan be traced a full half of the horror which has ever since haunted us.\\n\\nOur exact motive in looking back again was perhaps no more than the\\nimmemorial instinct of the pursued to gauge the nature and course\\nof its pursuer; or perhaps it was an automatic attempt to answer a\\nsubconscious question raised by one of our senses.\\n\\nIn the midst of our flight, with all our faculties centered on the\\nproblem of escape, we were in no condition to observe and analyze\\ndetails; yet even so our latent brain cells must have wondered at the\\nmessage brought them by our nostrils. Afterward, we realized what it\\nwasâ\\x80\\x94that our retreat from the fetid slime coating on those headless\\nobstructions, and the coincident approach of the pursuing entity, had\\nnot brought us the exchange of stenches which logic called for.\\n\\nIn the neighborhood of the prostrate things that new and lately\\nunexplainable fetor had been wholly dominant; but by this time it ought\\nto have largely given place to the nameless stench associated with\\nthose others. This it had not doneâ\\x80\\x94for instead, the newer and less\\nbearable smell was now virtually undiluted, and growing more and more\\npoisonously insistent each second.\\n\\nSo we glanced backâ\\x80\\x94simultaneously, it would appear; though no doubt\\nthe incipient motion of one prompted the imitation of the other. As\\nwe did so we flashed both torches full strength at the momentarily\\nthinned mist; either from sheer primitive anxiety to see all we could,\\nor in a less primitive but equally unconscious effort to dazzle the\\nentity before we dimmed our light and dodged among the penguins of the\\nlabyrinth center ahead.\\n\\nUnhappy act! Not Orpheus himself, or Lot\\'s wife, paid much more dearly\\nfor a backward glance. And again came that shocking, wide-ranged\\npipingâ\\x80\\x94\" Tekeli-li!

Tekeli-li! \" And at\\nlast we remembered that the demonic Shoggothsâ\\x80\\x94given life, though, and\\nplastic organ patterns solely by the Old Ones, and having no language\\nsave that which the dot groups expressedâ\\x80\\x94had likewise no voice save\\nthe imitated accents of their bygone masters.\\n\\nXII.\\n\\nDanforth and I have recollections of emerging into the great sculptured\\nhemisphere and of threading our back trail through the Cyclopean rooms\\nand corridors of the dead city; yet these are purely dream fragments\\ninvolving no memory of volition, details, or physical exertion.\\n\\nThere was something vaguely appropriate about our departure from those\\nburied epochs; for as we wound our panting way up the sixty-foot\\ncylinder of primal masonry we glimpsed beside us a continuous\\nprocession of heroic sculptures in the dead race\\'s early and undecayed\\ntechniqueâ\\x80\\x94a farewell from the Old Ones, written fifty million years\\nago.\\n\\nFinally, scrambling out at the top, we found ourselves on a great mound\\nof tumbled blocks, with the curved walls of higher stonework rising\\nwestward, and the brooding peaks of the great mountains showing beyond\\nthe more crumbled structures toward the east.\\n\\nThe sky above was a churning and opalescent mass of tenuous ice vapors,\\nand the cold clutched at our vitals.\\n\\nIn less than a quarter of an hour we had found the steep grade to the\\nfoothillsâ\\x80\\x94the probable ancient terraceâ\\x80\\x94by which we had descended, and\\ncould see the dark bulk of our great plane amidst the sparse ruins on\\nthe rising slope ahead.\\n\\nHalfway uphill toward our goal we paused for a momentary breathing\\nspell, and turned to look again at the fantastic tangle of incredible\\nstone shapes below usâ\\x80\\x94once more outlined mystically against an unknown\\nwest. As we did so we saw that the sky beyond had lost its morning\\nhaziness; the restless ice vapors having moved up to the zenith, where\\ntheir mocking outlines seemed on the point of settling into some\\nbizarre pattern which they feared to make quite definite or conclusive.\\n\\nThere now lay revealed on the ultimate white horizon behind\\nthe grotesque city a dim, elfin line of pinnacled violet whose\\nneedle-pointed heights loomed dreamlike against the beckoning rose\\ncolor of the western sky. Up toward this shimmering rim sloped the\\nancient table-land, the depressed course of the bygone river traversing\\nit as an irregular ribbon of shadow.\\n\\nFor a second we gasped in admiration of the scene\\'s unearthly cosmic\\nbeauty, and then vague horror began to creep into our souls. For this\\nfar violet line could be nothing else than the terrible mountains of\\nthe forbidden landâ\\x80\\x94highest of earth\\'s peaks and focus of earth\\'s evil;\\nharborers of nameless horrors and ArchÃ¦an secrets; shunned and prayed\\nto by those who feared to carve their meaning; untrodden by any living\\nthing of earth, but visited by the sinister lightnings and sending\\nstrange beams across the plains in the polar night.\\n\\nIf the sculptured maps and pictures in that prehuman city had told\\ntruly, these cryptic violet mountains could not be much less than three\\nhundred miles away; yet none the less sharply did their dim elfin\\nessence jut above that remote and snowy rim, like the serrated edge of\\na monstrous alien planet about to rise into unaccustomed heavens.\\n\\nLooking at them, I thought nervously of certain sculptured hints of\\nwhat the great bygone river had washed down into the city from their\\naccursed slopingâ\\x80\\x94and wondered how much sense and how much folly had\\nlain in the fears of those Old Ones who carved them so reticently.\\n\\nI recalled how their northerly end must come near the coast at Queen\\nMary Land, where even at that moment Sir Douglas Mawson\\'s expedition\\nwas doubtless working less than a thousand miles away; and hoped that\\nno evil fate would give Sir Douglas and his men a glimpse of what\\nmight lie beyond the protecting coastal range. Such thoughts formed a\\nmeasure of my overwrought condition at the timeâ\\x80\\x94and Danforth seemed to\\nbe even worse.\\n\\nYet before we had passed the great star-shaped ruin and reached our\\nplane our fears had become transferred to the lesser, but vast enough,\\nrange whose re-crossing lay ahead of us.\\n\\nFrom these foothills the black, ruin-crusted slopes reared up starkly\\nand hideously against the east, again reminding us of those strange\\nAsian paintings of Nicholas Roerich; and when we thought of the\\ndamnable honeycombings inside them, and of the frightful amorphous\\nentities that might have pushed their fetidly squirming sway even to\\nthe topmost hollow pinnacles, we could not face without panic the\\nprospect of again sailing by those suggestive skyward cave mouths where\\nthe wind made sounds like an evil musical piping over a wide range.\\n\\nTo make matters worse, we saw distinct traces of local mist around\\nseveral of the summitsâ\\x80\\x94as poor Lake must have done when he made that\\nearly mistake about volcanismâ\\x80\\x94and thought shiveringly of that kindred\\nmist from which we had just escapedâ\\x80\\x94of that, and of the blasphemous,\\nhorror-fostering abyss whence all such vapors came.\\n\\nAll was well with the plane, and we clumsily hauled on our heavy flying\\nfurs. Danforth got the engine started without trouble, and we made a\\nvery smooth take-off over the nightmare city.\\n\\nAt a very high level there must have been great disturbance, since the\\nice-dust clouds of the zenith were doing all sorts of fantastic things;\\nbut at twenty-four thousand feet, the height we needed for the pass, we\\nfound navigation quite practicable.\\n\\nAs we drew close to the jutting peaks the wind\\'s strange piping again\\nbecame manifest, and I could see Danforth\\'s hands trembling at the\\ncontrols. Rank amateur though I was, I thought at that moment that I\\nmight be a better navigator than he in effecting the dangerous crossing\\nbetween pinnacles; and when I made motions to change seats and take\\nover his duties he did not protest.\\n\\nI tried to keep all my skill and self-possession about me, and stared\\nat the sector of reddish farther sky betwixt the walls of the pass.\\n\\nBut Danforth, released from his piloting and keyed up to a dangerous\\nnervous pitch, could not keep quiet. I felt him turning and wriggling\\nabout as he looked back at the terrible receding city, ahead at the\\ncave-riddled, cube-barnacled peaks, sidewise at the bleak sea of snowy,\\nrampart-strown foothills, and upward at the seething, grotesquely\\nclouded sky.\\n\\nIt was then, just as I was trying to steer safely through the pass,\\nthat his mad shrieking brought us so close to disaster, by shattering\\nmy tight hold on myself and causing me to fumble helplessly with the\\ncontrols for a moment. A second afterward my resolution triumphed and\\nwe made the crossing safelyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94Yet I am afraid that Danforth will never\\nbe the same again.\\n\\nI have said that Danforth refused to tell me what final horror made him\\nscream out so insanelyâ\\x80\\x94a horror which, I feel sadly sure, is mainly\\nresponsible for his present breakdown. We had snatches of shouted\\nconversation above the wind\\'s piping and the engine\\'s buzzing as we\\nreached the safe side of the range and swooped slowly down toward the\\ncamp, but that had mostly to do with the pledges of secrecy we had made\\nas we prepared to leave the nightmare city.\\n\\nAll that Danforth has ever hinted is that the final horror was a\\nmirage. It was not, he declares, anything connected with the cubes\\nand caves of those echoing, vaporous, wormily honeycombed mountains\\nof madness which we crossed; but a single fantastic, demonic glimpse,\\namong the churning westward zenith clouds, of what lay back of those\\nother violet westward mountains which the Old Ones had shunned and\\nfeared.\\n\\nHe has on rare occasions whispered disjointed and irresponsible things\\nabout \"the black pit,\" \"the carven rim,\" \"the proto-Shoggoths,\" \"the\\nwindowless solids with five dimensions,\" \"the nameless cylinders,\" \"the\\nelder pharos,\" \"Yog-Sothoth,\" \"the primal white jelly,\" \"the color out\\nof space,\" \"the wings,\" \"the eyes in darkness,\" \"the moon-ladder,\" \"the\\noriginal, the eternal, the undying,\" and other bizarre conceptions;\\nbut when he is fully himself he repudiates all this and attributes it\\nto his curious and macabre reading of earlier years. Danforth, indeed,\\nis known to be among the few who have ever dared go completely through\\nthat worm-riddled copy of the Necronomicon kept under lock and key in\\nthe college library.\\n\\nThe higher sky, as we crossed the range, was surely vaporous and\\ndisturbed enough; and although I did not see the zenith I can well\\nimagine that its swirls of ice dust may have taken strange forms.\\nImagination, knowing how vividly distant scenes can sometimes be\\nreflected, refracted, and magnified by such layers of restless cloud,\\nmight easily have supplied the restâ\\x80\\x94and, of course, Danforth did not\\nhint any of these specific horrors till after his memory had had a\\nchance to draw on his bygone reading. He could never have seen so much\\nin one instantaneous glance.\\n\\nAt the time, his shrieks were confined to the repetition of a single,\\nmad word of all too obvious source: \" Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li! \"\\n\\nTHE END',\n",

LOVECRAFT\\n\\nA powerful story about an old church in Providence, Rhode Island, that was shunned and feared by all who knew it.\\n\\n[Transcriber\\'s Note: This etext was produced from Weird Tales December 1936. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\\n\\n(Dedicated to Robert Bloch)\\n\\nCautious investigators will hesitate to challenge the common belief\\nthat Robert Blake was killed by lightning, or by some profound nervous\\nshock derived from an electrical discharge. It is true that the window\\nhe faced was unbroken, but nature has shown herself capable of many\\nfreakish performances. The expression on his face may easily have\\narisen from some obscure muscular source unrelated to anything he saw,\\nwhile the entries in his diary are clearly the result of a fantastic\\nimagination aroused by certain local superstitions and by certain\\nold matters he had uncovered. As for the anomalous conditions at the\\ndeserted church on Federal Hillâ\\x80\\x94the shrewd analyst is not slow in\\nattributing them to some charlatanry, conscious or unconscious, with at\\nleast some of which Blake was secretly connected.\\n\\nFor after all, the victim was a writer and painter wholly devoted to\\nthe field of myth, dream, terror, and superstition, and avid in his\\nquest for scenes and effects of a bizarre, spectral sort. His earlier\\nstay in the cityâ\\x80\\x94a visit to a strange old man as deeply given to\\noccult and forbidden lore as heâ\\x80\\x94had ended amidst death and flame, and\\nit must have been some morbid instinct which drew him back from his\\nhome in Milwaukee. He may have known of the old stories despite his\\nstatements to the contrary in the diary, and his death may have nipped\\nin the bud some stupendous hoax destined to have a literary reflection.\\n\\nAmong those, however, who have examined and correlated all this\\nevidence, there remain several who cling to less rational and\\ncommonplace theories. They are inclined to take much of Blake\\'s diary\\nat its face value, and point significantly to certain facts such as\\nthe undoubted genuineness of the old church record, the verified\\nexistence of the disliked and unorthodox Starry Wisdom sect prior to\\n1877, the recorded disappearance of an inquisitive reporter named\\nEdwin M. Lillibridge in 1893, andâ\\x80\\x94above allâ\\x80\\x94the look of monstrous,\\ntransfiguring fear on the face of the young writer when he died. It was\\none of these believers who, moved to fanatical extremes, threw into\\nthe bay the curiously angled stone and its strangely adorned metal box\\nfound in the old church steepleâ\\x80\\x94the black windowless steeple, and not\\nthe tower where Blake\\'s diary said those things originally were. Though\\nwidely censured both officially and unofficially, this manâ\\x80\\x94a reputable\\nphysician with a taste for odd folkloreâ\\x80\\x94averred that he had rid the\\nearth of something too dangerous to rest upon it.\\n\\nBetween these two schools of opinion the reader must judge for himself.\\nThe papers have given the tangible details from a skeptical angle,\\nleaving for others the drawing of the picture as Robert Blake saw\\nitâ\\x80\\x94or thought he saw itâ\\x80\\x94or pretended to see it. Now, studying the\\ndiary closely, dispassionately, and at leisure, let us summarize the\\ndark chain of events from the expressed point of view of their chief\\nactor.\\n\\nYoung Blake returned to Providence in the winter of 1934-5, taking\\nthe upper floor of a venerable dwelling in a grassy court off\\nCollege Streetâ\\x80\\x94on the crest of the great eastward hill near the\\nBrown University campus and behind the marble John Hay Library.\\nIt was a cozy and fascinating place, in a little garden oasis of\\nvillage-like antiquity where huge, friendly cats sunned themselves\\natop a convenient shed. The square Georgian house had a monitor roof,\\nclassic doorway with fan carving, small-paned windows, and all the\\nother earmarks of early Nineteenth Century workmanship. Inside were\\nsix-paneled doors, wide floor-boards, a curving colonial staircase,\\nwhite Adam-period mantels, and a rear set of rooms three steps below\\nthe general level.\\n\\nBlake\\'s study, a large southwest chamber, overlooked the front garden\\non one side, while its west windowsâ\\x80\\x94before one of which he had his\\ndeskâ\\x80\\x94faced off from the brow of the hill and commanded a splendid view\\nof the lower town\\'s out-spread roofs and of the mystical sunsets that\\nflamed behind them. On the far horizon were the open countryside\\'s\\npurple slopes. Against these, some two miles away, rose the spectral\\nhump of Federal Hill, bristling with huddled roofs and steeples whose\\nremote outlines wavered mysteriously, taking fantastic forms as the\\nsmoke of the city swirled up and enmeshed them. Blake had a curious\\nsense that he was looking upon some unknown, ethereal world which might\\nor might not vanish in dream if ever he tried to seek it out and enter\\nit in person.\\n\\nHaving sent home for most of his books, Blake bought some antique\\nfurniture suitable to his quarters and settled down to write and\\npaintâ\\x80\\x94living alone, and attending to the simple housework himself. His\\nstudio was in a north attic room, where the panes of the monitor roof\\nfurnished admirable lighting. During that first winter he produced five\\nof his best-known short storiesâ\\x80\\x94 The Burrower Beneath , The Stairs in\\nthe Crypt , Shaggai , In the Vale of Pnath , and The Feaster from\\nthe Stars â\\x80\\x94and painted seven canvases; studies of nameless, unhuman\\nmonsters, and profoundly alien, non-terrestrial landscapes.\\n\\nAt sunset he would often sit at his desk and gaze dreamily off at\\nthe out-spread westâ\\x80\\x94the dark towers of Memorial Hall just below,\\nthe Georgian court-house belfry, the lofty pinnacles of the downtown\\nsection, and that shimmering, spire-crowned mound in the distance whose\\nunknown streets and labyrinthine gables so potently provoked his fancy.\\nFrom his few local acquaintances he learned that the far-off slope\\nwas a vast Italian quarter, though most of the houses were remnants\\nof older Yankee and Irish days. Now and then he would train his\\nfield-glasses on that spectral, unreachable world beyond the curling\\nsmoke; picking out individual roofs and chimneys and steeples, and\\nspeculating upon the bizarre and curious mysteries they might house.\\nEven with optical aid Federal Hill seemed somehow alien, half fabulous,\\nand linked to the unreal, intangible marvels of Blake\\'s own tales and\\npictures. The feeling would persist long after the hill had faded into\\nthe violet, lamp-starred twilight, and the court-house floodlights\\nand the red Industrial Trust beacon had blazed up to make the night\\ngrotesque.\\n\\nOf all the distant objects on Federal Hill, a certain huge, dark church\\nmost fascinated Blake. It stood out with especial distinctness at\\ncertain hours of the day, and at sunset the great tower and tapering\\nsteeple loomed blackly against the flaming sky. It seemed to rest\\non especially high ground; for the grimy faÃ§ade, and the obliquely\\nseen north side with sloping roof and the tops of great pointed\\nwindows, rose boldly above the tangle of surrounding ridgepoles and\\nchimney-pots. Peculiarly grim and austere, it appeared to be built of\\nstone, stained and weathered with the smoke and storms of a century\\nand more. The style, so far as the glass could show, was that earliest\\nexperimental form of Gothic revival which preceded the stately Upjohn\\nperiod and held over some of the outlines and proportions of the\\nGeorgian age. Perhaps it was reared around 1810 or 1815.\\n\\nAs the months passed, Blake watched the far-off, forbidding structure\\nwith an oddly mounting interest. Since the vast windows were never\\nlighted, he knew that it must be vacant. The longer he watched, the\\nmore his imagination worked, till at length he began to fancy curious\\nthings. He believed that a vague, singular aura of desolation hovered\\nover the place, so that even the pigeons and swallows shunned its smoky\\neaves. Around other towers and belfries his glass would reveal great\\nflocks of birds, but here they never rested. At least, that is what he\\nthought and set down in his diary. He pointed the place out to several\\nfriends, but none of them had even been on Federal Hill or possessed\\nthe faintest notion of what the church was or had been.\\n\\nIn the spring a deep restlessness gripped Blake. He had begun his\\nlong-planned novelâ\\x80\\x94based on a supposed survival of the witch-cult in\\nMaineâ\\x80\\x94but was strangely unable to make progress with it. More and more\\nhe would sit at his westward window and gaze at the distant hill and\\nthe black, frowning steeple shunned by the birds. When the delicate\\nleaves came out on the garden boughs the world was filled with a new\\nbeauty, but Blake\\'s restlessness was merely increased. It was then\\nthat he first thought of crossing the city and climbing bodily up that\\nfabulous slope into the smoke-wreathed world of dream.\\n\\nLate in April, just before the eon-shadowed Walpurgis time, Blake made\\nhis first trip into the unknown. Plodding through the endless downtown\\nstreets and the bleak, decayed squares beyond, he came finally upon\\nthe ascending avenue of century-worn steps, sagging Doric porches,\\nand blear-paned cupolas which he felt must lead up to the long-known,\\nunreachable world beyond the mists. There were dingy blue-and-white\\nstreet signs which meant nothing to him, and presently he noted the\\nstrange, dark faces of the drifting crowds, and the foreign signs\\nover curious shops in brown, decade-weathered buildings. Nowhere\\ncould he find any of the objects he had seen from afar; so that once\\nmore he half fancied that the Federal Hill of that distant view was a\\ndream-world never to be trod by living human feet.\\n\\nNow and then a battered church faÃ§ade or crumbling spire came in\\nsight, but never the blackened pile that he sought. When he asked a\\nshopkeeper about a great stone church the man smiled and shook his\\nhead, though he spoke English freely. As Blake climbed higher, the\\nregion seemed stranger and stranger, with bewildering mazes of brooding\\nbrown alleys leading eternally off to the south. He crossed two or\\nthree broad avenues, and once thought he glimpsed a familiar tower.\\nAgain he asked a merchant about the massive church of stone, and this\\ntime he could have sworn that the plea of ignorance was feigned. The\\ndark man\\'s face had a look of fear which he tried to hide, and Blake\\nsaw him make a curious sign with his right hand.\\n\\nThen suddenly a black spire stood out against the cloudy sky on his\\nleft, above the tiers of brown roofs lining the tangled southerly\\nalleys. Blake knew at once what it was, and plunged toward it through\\nthe squalid, unpaved lanes that climbed from the avenue. Twice he\\nlost his way, but he somehow dared not ask any of the patriarchs or\\nhousewives who sat on their door-steps, or any of the children who\\nshouted and played in the mud of the shadowy lanes.\\n\\nAt last he saw the tower plain against the southwest, and a huge\\nstone bulk rose darkly at the end of an alley. Presently he stood in\\na wind-swept open square, quaintly cobblestoned, with a high bank\\nwall on the farther side. This was the end of his quest; for upon the\\nwide, iron-railed, weed-grown plateau which the wall supportedâ\\x80\\x94a\\nseparate, lesser world raised fully six feet above the surrounding\\nstreetsâ\\x80\\x94there stood a grim, titan bulk whose identity, despite Blake\\'s\\nnew perspective, was beyond dispute.\\n\\nThe vacant church was in a state of great decrepitude. Some of the high\\nstone buttresses had fallen, and several delicate finials lay half lost\\namong the brown, neglected weeds and grasses. The sooty Gothic windows\\nwere largely unbroken, though many of the stone mullions were missing.\\nBlake wondered how the obscurely painted panes could have survived so\\nwell, in view of the known habits of small boys the world over. The\\nmassive doors were intact and tightly closed. Around the top of the\\nbank wall, fully enclosing the grounds, was a rusty iron fence whose\\ngateâ\\x80\\x94at the head of a flight of steps from the squareâ\\x80\\x94was visibly\\npadlocked. The path from the gate to the building was completely\\novergrown. Desolation and decay hung like a pall above the place, and\\nin the birdless eaves and black, ivyless walls Blake felt a touch of\\nthe dimly sinister beyond his power to define.\\n\\nThere were very few people in the square, but Blake saw a policeman\\nat the northerly end and approached him with questions about the\\nchurch. He was a great wholesome Irishman, and it seemed odd that he\\nwould do little more than make the sign of the cross and mutter that\\npeople never spoke of that building. When Blake pressed him he said\\nvery hurriedly that the Italian priests warned everybody against it,\\nvowing that a monstrous evil had once dwelt there and left its mark.\\nHe himself had heard dark whispers of it from his father, who recalled\\ncertain sounds and rumors from his boyhood.\\n\\nThere had been a bad sect there in the ould daysâ\\x80\\x94an outlaw sect that\\ncalled up awful things from some unknown gulf of night. It had taken\\na good priest to exorcise what had come, though there did be those\\nwho said that merely the light could do it. If Father O\\'Malley were\\nalive there would be many the thing he could tell. But now there was\\nnothing to do but let it alone. It hurt nobody now, and those that\\nowned it were dead or far away. They had run away like rats after\\nthe threatening talk in \\'77, when people began to mind the way folks\\nvanished now and then in the neighborhood. Some day the city would\\nstep in and take the property for lack of heirs, but little good would\\ncome of anybody\\'s touching it. Better it be left alone for the years\\nto topple, lest things be stirred that ought to rest for ever in their\\nblack abyss.\\n\\nAfter the policeman had gone Blake stood staring at the sullen steepled\\npile. It excited him to find that the structure seemed as sinister\\nto others as to him, and he wondered what grain of truth might lie\\nbehind the old tales the bluecoat had repeated. Probably they were mere\\nlegends evoked by the evil look of the place, but even so, they were\\nlike a strange coming to life of one of his own stories.\\n\\nThe afternoon sun came out from behind dispersing clouds, but seemed\\nunable to light up the stained, sooty walls of the old temple that\\ntowered on its high plateau. It was odd that the green of spring had\\nnot touched the brown, withered growths in the raised, iron-fenced\\nyard. Blake found himself edging nearer the raised area and examining\\nthe bank wall and rusted fence for possible avenues of ingress. There\\nwas a terrible lure about the blackened fane which was not to be\\nresisted. The fence had no opening near the steps, but around on the\\nnorth side were some missing bars. He could go up the steps and walk\\naround on the narrow coping outside the fence till he came to the\\ngap. If the people feared the place so wildly, he would encounter no\\ninterference.\\n\\nHe was on the embankment and almost inside the fence before anyone\\nnoticed him. Then, looking down, he saw the few people in the square\\nedging away and making the same sign with their right hands that the\\nshopkeeper in the avenue had made. Several windows were slammed down,\\nand a fat woman darted into the street and pulled some small children\\ninside a rickety, unpainted house. The gap in the fence was very easy\\nto pass through, and before long Blake found himself wading amidst\\nthe rotting, tangled growths of the deserted yard. Here and there the\\nworn stump of a headstone told him that there had once been burials\\nin this field; but that, he saw, must have been very long ago. The\\nsheer bulk of the church was oppressive now that he was close to it,\\nbut he conquered his mood and approached to try the three great doors\\nin the faÃ§ade. All were securely locked, so he began a circuit of the\\nCyclopean building in quest of some minor and more penetrable opening.\\nEven then he could not be sure that he wished to enter that haunt of\\ndesertion and shadow, yet the pull of its strangeness dragged him on\\nautomatically.\\n\\nA yawning and unprotected cellar window in the rear furnished the\\nneeded aperture. Peering in, Blake saw a subterrene gulf of cobwebs\\nand dust faintly litten by the western sun\\'s filtered rays. Debris,\\nold barrels, and ruined boxes and furniture of numerous sorts met his\\neye, though over everything lay a shroud of dust which softened all\\nsharp outlines. The rusted remains of a hot-air furnace showed that the\\nbuilding had been used and kept in shape as late as mid-Victorian times.\\n\\nActing almost without conscious initiative, Blake crawled through the\\nwindow and let himself down to the dust-carpeted and debris-strewn\\nconcrete floor. The vaulted cellar was a vast one, without partitions;\\nand in a corner far to the right, amid dense shadows, he saw a black\\narchway evidently leading upstairs. He felt a peculiar sense of\\noppression at being actually within the great spectral building,\\nbut kept it in check as he cautiously scouted aboutâ\\x80\\x94finding a\\nstill-intact barrel amid the dust, and rolling it over to the open\\nwindow to provide for his exit. Then, bracing himself, he crossed the\\nwide, cobweb-festooned space toward the arch. Half choked with the\\nomnipresent dust, and covered with ghostly gossamer fibers, he reached\\nand began to climb the worn stone steps which rose into the darkness.\\nHe had no light, but groped carefully with his hands. After a sharp\\nturn he felt a closed door ahead, and a little fumbling revealed its\\nancient latch. It opened inward, and beyond it he saw a dimly illumined\\ncorridor lined with worm-eaten paneling.\\n\\nOnce on the ground floor, Blake began exploring in a rapid fashion.\\nAll the inner doors were unlocked, so that he freely passed from room\\nto room. The colossal nave was an almost eldritch place with its\\ndrifts and mountains of dust over box pews, altar, hour-glass pulpit,\\nand sounding-board, and its titanic ropes of cobweb stretching among\\nthe pointed arches of the gallery and entwining the clustered Gothic\\ncolumns. Over all this hushed desolation played a hideous leaden light\\nas the declining afternoon sun sent its rays through the strange,\\nhalf-blackened panes of the great apsidal windows.\\n\\nThe paintings on those windows were so obscured by soot that Blake\\ncould scarcely decipher what they had represented, but from the little\\nhe could make out he did not like them. The designs were largely\\nconventional, and his knowledge of obscure symbolism told him much\\nconcerning some of the ancient patterns. The few saints depicted bore\\nexpressions distinctly open to criticism, while one of the windows\\nseemed to show merely a dark space with spirals of curious luminosity\\nscattered about in it. Turning away from the windows, Blake noticed\\nthat the cobwebbed cross above the altar was not of the ordinary kind,\\nbut resembled the primordial ankh or crux ansata of shadowy Egypt.\\n\\nIn a rear vestry room beside the apse Blake found a rotting desk and\\nceiling-high shelves of mildewed, disintegrating books. Here for the\\nfirst time he received a positive shock of objective horror, for the\\ntitles of those books told him much. They were the black, forbidden\\nthings which most sane people have never even heard of, or have\\nheard of only in furtive, timorous whispers; the banned and dreaded\\nrepositories of equivocal secrets and immemorial formulÃ¦ which have\\ntrickled down the stream of time from the days of man\\'s youth, and the\\ndim, fabulous days before man was. He had himself read many of themâ\\x80\\x94a\\nLatin version of the abhorred Necronomicon , the sinister Liber\\nIvonis , the infamous Cultes des Goules of Comte d\\'Erlette, the Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt, and old Ludvig Prinn\\'s hellish De Vermis Mysteriis . But there were others he had known merely by\\nreputation or not at allâ\\x80\\x94the Pnakotic Manuscripts , the Book of\\nDzyan , and a crumbling volume in wholly unidentifiable characters yet\\nwith certain symbols and diagrams shudderingly recognizable to the\\noccult student. Clearly, the lingering local rumors had not lied. This\\nplace had once been the seat of an evil older than mankind and wider\\nthan the known universe.\\n\\nIn the ruined desk was a small leather-bound record-book filled with\\nentries in some odd cryptographic medium. The manuscript writing\\nconsisted of the common traditional symbols used today in astronomy and\\nanciently in alchemy, astrology, and other dubious artsâ\\x80\\x94the devices\\nof the sun, moon, planets, aspects, and zodiacal signsâ\\x80\\x94here massed in\\nsolid pages of text, with divisions and paragraphings suggesting that\\neach symbol answered to some alphabetical letter.\\n\\nIn the hope of later solving the cryptogram, Blake bore off this\\nvolume in his coat pocket. Many of the great tomes on the shelves\\nfascinated him unutterably, and he felt tempted to borrow them at some\\nlater time. He wondered how they could have remained undisturbed so\\nlong. Was he the first to conquer the clutching, pervasive fear which\\nhad for nearly sixty years protected this deserted place from visitors?\\n\\nHaving now thoroughly explored the ground floor, Blake plowed again\\nthrough the dust of the spectral nave to the front vestibule, where he\\nhad seen a door and staircase presumably leading up to the blackened\\ntower and steepleâ\\x80\\x94objects so long familiar to him at a distance. The\\nascent was a choking experience, for dust lay thick, while the spiders\\nhad done their worst in this constricted place. The staircase was a\\nspiral with high, narrow wooden treads, and now and then Blake passed a\\nclouded window looking dizzily out over the city. Though he had seen no\\nropes below, he expected to find a bell or peal of bells in the tower\\nwhose narrow, louver-boarded lancet windows his field-glass had studied\\nso often. Here he was doomed to disappointment, for when he attained\\nthe top of the stairs he found the tower chamber vacant of chimes, and\\nclearly devoted to vastly different purposes.\\n\\nThe room, about fifteen feet square, was faintly lighted by four lancet\\nwindows, one on each side, which were glazed within their screening of\\ndecayed louver-boards. These had been further fitted with tight, opaque\\nscreens, but the latter were now largely rotted away. In the center of\\nthe dust-laden floor rose a curiously angled stone pillar some four\\nfeet in height and two in average diameter, covered on each side with\\nbizarre, crudely incised and wholly unrecognizable hieroglyphs. On\\nthis pillar rested a metal box of peculiarly asymmetrical form; its\\nhinged lid thrown back, and its interior holding what looked beneath\\nthe decade-deep dust to be an egg-shaped or irregularly spherical\\nobject some four inches through. Around the pillar in a rough circle\\nwere seven high-backed Gothic chairs still largely intact, while behind\\nthem, ranging along the dark-paneled walls, were seven colossal images\\nof crumbling, black-painted plaster, resembling more than anything else\\nthe cryptic carven megaliths of mysterious Easter Island. In one corner\\nof the cobwebbed chamber a ladder was built into the wall, leading up\\nto the closed trap-door of the windowless steeple above.\\n\\nAs Blake grew accustomed to the feeble light he noticed odd bas-reliefs\\non the strange open box of yellowish metal. Approaching, he tried to\\nclear the dust away with his hands and handkerchief, and saw that\\nthe figurings were of a monstrous and utterly alien kind; depicting\\nentities which, though seemingly alive, resembled no known life-form\\never evolved on this planet. The four-inch seeming sphere turned out\\nto be a nearly black, red-striated polyhedron with many irregular\\nflat surfaces; either a very remarkable crystal of some sort, or an\\nartificial object of carved and highly polished mineral matter. It did\\nnot touch the bottom of the box, but was held suspended by means of\\na metal band around its center, with seven queerly-designed supports\\nextending horizontally to angles of the box\\'s inner wall near the\\ntop. This stone, once exposed, exerted upon Blake an almost alarming\\nfascination. He could scarcely tear his eyes from it, and as he looked\\nat its glistening surfaces he almost fancied it was transparent, with\\nhalf-formed worlds of wonder within. Into his mind floated pictures of\\nalien orbs with great stone towers, and other orbs with titan mountains\\nand no mark of life, and still remoter spaces where only a stirring in\\nvague blacknesses told of the presence of consciousness and will.\\n\\nWhen he did look away, it was to notice a somewhat singular mound of\\ndust in the far corner near the ladder to the steeple. Just why it took\\nhis attention he could not tell, but something in its contours carried\\na message to his unconscious mind. Plowing toward it, and brushing\\naside the hanging cobwebs as he went, he began to discern something\\ngrim about it. Hand and handkerchief soon revealed the truth, and Blake\\ngasped with a baffling mixture of emotions. It was a human skeleton,\\nand it must have been there for a very long time. The clothing was in\\nshreds, but some buttons and fragments of cloth bespoke a man\\'s gray\\nsuit. There were other bits of evidenceâ\\x80\\x94shoes, metal clasps, huge\\nbuttons for round cuffs, a stickpin of bygone pattern, a reporter\\'s\\nbadge with the name of the old Providence Telegram , and a crumbling\\nleather pocket-book. Blake examined the latter with care, finding\\nwithin it several bills of antiquated issue, a celluloid advertising\\ncalendar for 1893, some cards with the name \"Edwin M. Lillibridge,\" and\\na paper covered with penciled memoranda.\\n\\nThis paper held much of a puzzling nature, and Blake read it carefully\\nat the dim westward window. Its disjointed text included such phrases\\nas the following:\\n\\n\"Prof. Enoch Bowen home from Egypt May 1844â\\x80\\x94buys old Free-Will Church\\nin Julyâ\\x80\\x94his archÃ¦ological work & studies in occult well known.\"\\n\\n\"Dr. Drowne of 4th Baptist warns against Starry Wisdom in sermon Dec.\\n29, 1844.\"\\n\\n\"Congregation 97 by end of \\'45.\"\\n\\n\"1846â\\x80\\x943 disappearancesâ\\x80\\x94first mention of Shining Trapezohedron.\"\\n\\n\"7 disappearances 1848â\\x80\\x94stories of blood sacrifice begin.\"\\n\\n\"Investigation 1853 comes to nothingâ\\x80\\x94stories of sounds.\"\\n\\n\"Fr.

Perhaps no one else had known of his\\nplanâ\\x80\\x94who could tell? But he had never returned to his paper. Had some\\nbravely-suppressed fear risen to overcome him and bring on sudden\\nheart-failure? Blake stooped over the gleaming bones and noted their\\npeculiar state. Some of them were badly scattered, and a few seemed\\noddly dissolved at the ends. Others were strangely yellowed, with\\nvague suggestions of charring. This charring extended to some of the\\nfragments of clothing. The skull was in a very peculiar stateâ\\x80\\x94stained\\nyellow, and with a charred aperture in the top as if some powerful acid\\nhad eaten through the solid bone. What had happened to the skeleton\\nduring its four decades of silent entombment here Blake could not\\nimagine.\\n\\n\"He had come to the deserted edifice in quest of a newspaper sensation.\"\\n\\nBefore he realized it, he was looking at the stone again, and letting\\nits curious influence call up a nebulous pageantry in his mind. He saw\\nprocessions of robed, hooded figures whose outlines were not human, and\\nlooked on endless leagues of desert lined with carved, sky-reaching\\nmonoliths. He saw towers and walls in nighted depths under the sea,\\nand vortices of space where wisps of black mist floated before thin\\nshimmerings of cold purple haze. And beyond all else he glimpsed an\\ninfinite gulf of sheer darkness, where solid and semi-solid forms were\\nknown only by their windy stirrings, and cloudy patterns of force\\nseemed to superimpose order on chaos and hold forth a key to all the\\nparadoxes and arcana of the worlds we know.\\n\\nThen all at once the spell was broken by an access of gnawing,\\nindeterminate panic fear. Blake choked and turned away from the stone,\\nconscious of some formless alien presence close to him and watching him\\nwith horrible intentness. He felt entangled with somethingâ\\x80\\x94something\\nwhich was not in the stone, but which had looked through it at\\nhimâ\\x80\\x94something which would ceaselessly follow him with a cognition\\nthat was not physical sight. Plainly, the place was getting on his\\nnervesâ\\x80\\x94as well it might in view of his gruesome find. The light was\\nwaning, too, and since he had no illuminant with him he knew he would\\nhave to be leaving soon.\\n\\nIt was then, in the gathering twilight, that he thought he saw a\\nfaint trace of luminosity in the crazily angled stone. He had tried\\nto look away from it, but some obscure compulsion drew his eyes back.\\nWas there a subtle phosphorescence of radio-activity about the thing?\\nWhat was it that the dead man\\'s notes had said concerning a Shining\\nTrapezohedron ? What, anyway, was this abandoned lair of cosmic evil?\\nWhat had been done here, and what might still be lurking in the\\nbird-shunned shadows? It seemed now as if an elusive touch of fetor had\\narisen somewhere close by, though its source was not apparent. Blake\\nseized the cover of the long-open box and snapped it down. It moved\\neasily on its alien hinges, and closed completely over the unmistakably\\nglowing stone.\\n\\nAt the sharp click of that closing a soft stirring sound seemed to come\\nfrom the steeple\\'s eternal blackness overhead, beyond the trap-door.\\nRats, without questionâ\\x80\\x94the only living things to reveal their presence\\nin this accursed pile since he had entered it. And yet that stirring in\\nthe steeple frightened him horribly, so that he plunged almost wildly\\ndown the spiral stairs, across the ghoulish nave, into the vaulted\\nbasement, out amidst the gathering dusk of the deserted square, and\\ndown through the teeming, fear-haunted alleys and avenues of Federal\\nHill toward the sane central streets and the home-like brick sidewalks\\nof the college district.\\n\\nDuring the days which followed, Blake told no one of his expedition.\\nInstead, he read much in certain books, examined long years of\\nnewspaper files downtown, and worked feverishly at the cryptogram in\\nthat leather volume from the cobwebbed vestry room. The cipher, he soon\\nsaw, was no simple one; and after a long period of endeavor he felt\\nsure that its language could not be English, Latin, Greek, French,\\nSpanish, Italian, or German. Evidently he would have to draw upon the\\ndeepest wells of his strange erudition.\\n\\nEvery evening the old impulse to gaze westward returned, and he saw the\\nblack steeple as of yore amongst the bristling roofs of a distant and\\nhalf-fabulous world. But now it held a fresh note of terror for him. He\\nknew the heritage of evil lore it masked, and with the knowledge his\\nvision ran riot in queer new ways. The birds of spring were returning,\\nand as he watched their sunset flights he fancied they avoided the\\ngaunt, lone spire as never before. When a flock of them approached it,\\nhe thought, they would wheel and scatter in panic confusionâ\\x80\\x94and he\\ncould guess at the wild twitterings which failed to reach him across\\nthe intervening miles.\\n\\nIt was in June that Blake\\'s diary told of his victory over the\\ncryptogram. The text was, he found, in the dark Aklo language used by\\ncertain cults of evil antiquity, and known to him in a halting way\\nthrough previous researches. The diary is strangely reticent about\\nwhat Blake deciphered, but he was patently awed and disconcerted by\\nhis results. There are references to a Haunter of the Dark awaked by\\ngazing into the Shining Trapezohedron, and insane conjectures about the\\nblack gulfs of chaos from which it was called. The being is spoken of\\nas holding all knowledge, and demanding monstrous sacrifices. Some of\\nBlake\\'s entries show fear lest the thing, which he seemed to regard as\\nsummoned, stalk abroad; though he adds that the street-lights form a\\nbulwark which cannot be crossed.\\n\\nOf the Shining Trapezohedron he speaks often, calling it a window\\non all time and space, and tracing its history from the days it was\\nfashioned on dark Yuggoth, before ever the Old Ones brought it to\\nearth. It was treasured and placed in its curious box by the crinoid\\nthings of Antarctica, salvaged from their ruins by the serpent-men of\\nValusia, and peered at eons later in Lemuria by the first human beings.\\nIt crossed strange lands and stranger seas, and sank with Atlantis\\nbefore a Minoan fisher meshed it in his net and sold it to swarthy\\nmerchants from nighted Khem. The Pharaoh Nephren-Ka built around it a\\ntemple with a windowless crypt, and did that which caused his name to\\nbe stricken from all monuments and records. Then it slept in the ruins\\nof that evil fane which the priests and the new Pharaoh destroyed, till\\nthe delver\\'s spade once more brought it forth to curse mankind.\\n\\nEarly in July the newspapers oddly supplement Blake\\'s entries, though\\nin so brief and casual a way that only the diary has called general\\nattention to their contribution. It appears that a new fear had been\\ngrowing on Federal Hill since a stranger had entered the dreaded\\nchurch. The Italians whispered of unaccustomed stirrings and bumpings\\nand scrapings in the dark windowless steeple, and called on their\\npriests to banish an entity which haunted their dreams. Something,\\nthey said, was constantly watching at a door to see if it were dark\\nenough to venture forth. Press items mentioned the long-standing local\\nsuperstitions, but failed to shed much light on the earlier background\\nof the horror. It was obvious that the young reporters of today are no\\nantiquarians. In writing of these things in his diary, Blake expresses\\na curious kind of remorse, and talks of the duty of burying the\\nShining Trapezohedron and of banishing what he had evoked by letting\\ndaylight into the hideous jutting spire. At the same time, however, he\\ndisplays the dangerous extent of his fascination, and admits a morbid\\nlongingâ\\x80\\x94pervading even his dreamsâ\\x80\\x94to visit the accursed tower and\\ngaze again into the cosmic secrets of the glowing stone.\\n\\nThen something in the Journal on the morning of July 17 threw the\\ndiarist into a veritable fever of horror. It was only a variant of the\\nother half-humorous items about the Federal Hill restlessness, but to\\nBlake it was somehow very terrible indeed. In the night a thunderstorm\\nhad put the city\\'s lighting-system out of commission for a full hour,\\nand in that black interval the Italians had nearly gone mad with\\nfright. Those living near the dreaded church had sworn that the thing\\nin the steeple had taken advantage of the street lamps\\' absence and\\ngone down into the body of the church, flopping and bumping around in\\na viscous, altogether dreadful way. Toward the last it had bumped up\\nto the tower, where there were sounds of the shattering of glass. It\\ncould go wherever the darkness reached, but light would always send it\\nfleeing.\\n\\nWhen the current blazed on again there had been a shocking commotion\\nin the tower, for even the feeble light trickling through the\\ngrime-blackened, louver-boarded windows was too much for the thing.\\nIt had bumped and slithered up into its tenebrous steeple just in\\ntimeâ\\x80\\x94for a long dose of light would have sent it back into the abyss\\nwhence the crazy stranger had called it. During the dark hour praying\\ncrowds had clustered round the church in the rain with lighted candles\\nand lamps somehow shielded with folded papers and umbrellasâ\\x80\\x94a guard\\nof light to save the city from the nightmare that stalks in darkness.\\nOnce, those nearest the church declared, the outer door had rattled\\nhideously.\\n\\nBut even this was not the worst. That evening in the Bulletin Blake\\nread of what the reporters had found. Aroused at last to the whimsical\\nnews value of the scare, a pair of them had defied the frantic crowds\\nof Italians and crawled into the church through the cellar window\\nafter trying the doors in vain. They found the dust of the vestibule\\nand of the spectral nave plowed up in a singular way, with pits of\\nrotted cushions and satin pew-linings scattered curiously around. There\\nwas a bad odor everywhere, and here and there were bits of yellow stain\\nand patches of what looked like charring. Opening the door to the\\ntower, and pausing a moment at the suspicion of a scraping sound above,\\nthey found the narrow spiral stairs wiped roughly clean.\\n\\nIn the tower itself a similarly half-swept condition existed. They\\nspoke of the heptagonal stone pillar, the overturned Gothic chairs,\\nand the bizarre plaster images; though strangely enough the metal box\\nand the old mutilated skeleton were not mentioned. What disturbed\\nBlake the mostâ\\x80\\x94except for the hints of stains and charring and bad\\nodorsâ\\x80\\x94was the final detail that explained the crashing glass. Every\\none of the tower\\'s lancet windows was broken, and two of them had\\nbeen darkened in a crude and hurried way by the stuffing of satin\\npew-linings and cushion-horsehair into the spaces between the slanting\\nexterior louver-boards. More satin fragments and bunches of horsehair\\nlay scattered around the newly swept floor, as if someone had been\\ninterrupted in the act of restoring the tower to the absolute blackness\\nof its tightly curtained days.\\n\\nYellowish stains and charred patches were found on the ladder to\\nthe windowless spire, but when a reporter climbed up, opened the\\nhorizontally-sliding trap-door and shot a feeble flashlight beam into\\nthe black and strangely fetid space, he saw nothing but darkness, and\\nan heterogeneous litter of shapeless fragments near the aperture. The\\nverdict, of course, was charlatanry. Somebody had played a joke on\\nthe superstitious hill-dwellers, or else some fanatic had striven to\\nbolster up their fears for their own supposed good. Or perhaps some of\\nthe younger and more sophisticated dwellers had staged an elaborate\\nhoax on the outside world. There was an amusing aftermath when the\\npolice sent an officer to verify the reports. Three men in succession\\nfound ways of evading the assignment, and the fourth went very\\nreluctantly and returned very soon without adding to the account given\\nby the reporters.\\n\\nFrom this point onward Blake\\'s diary shows a mounting tide of\\ninsidious horror and nervous apprehension. He upbraids himself for\\nnot doing something, and speculates wildly on the consequences of\\nanother electrical breakdown. It has been verified that on three\\noccasionsâ\\x80\\x94during thunderstormsâ\\x80\\x94he telephoned the electric light\\ncompany in a frantic vein and asked that desperate precautions against\\na lapse of power be taken. Now and then his entries show concern over\\nthe failure of the reporters to find the metal box and stone, and the\\nstrangely marred old skeleton, when they explored the shadowy tower\\nroom. He assumed that these things had been removedâ\\x80\\x94whither, and\\nby whom or what, he could only guess. But his worst fears concerned\\nhimself, and the kind of unholy rapport he felt to exist between his\\nmind and that lurking horror in the distant steepleâ\\x80\\x94that monstrous\\nthing of night which his rashness had called out of the ultimate black\\nspaces. He seemed to feel a constant tugging at his will, and callers\\nof that period remember how he would sit abstractedly at his desk and\\nstare out the west window at that far-off, spire-bristling mound beyond\\nthe swirling smoke of the city. His entries dwell monotonously on\\ncertain terrible dreams, and of a strengthening of the unholy rapport\\nin his sleep. There is mention of a night when he awaked to find\\nhimself fully dressed, outdoors, and headed automatically down College\\nHill toward the west. Again and again he dwells on the fact that the\\nthing in the steeple knows where to find him.\\n\\nThe week following July 30 is recalled as the time of Blake\\'s partial\\nbreakdown. He did not dress, and ordered all his food by telephone.\\nVisitors remarked the cords he kept near his bed, and he said that\\nsleep-walking had forced him to bind his ankles every night with knots\\nwhich would probably hold or else waken him with the labor of untying.\\n\\nIn his diary he told of the hideous experience which had brought the\\ncollapse. After retiring on the night of the 30th he had suddenly found\\nhimself groping about in an almost black space. All he could see were\\nshort, faint, horizontal streaks of bluish light, but he could smell an\\noverpowering fetor and hear a curious jumble of soft, furtive sounds\\nabove him. Whenever he moved he stumbled over something, and at each\\nnoise there would come a sort of answering sound from aboveâ\\x80\\x94a vague\\nstirring, mixed with the cautious sliding of wood on wood.\\n\\nOnce his groping hands encountered a pillar of stone with a vacant top,\\nwhilst later he found himself clutching the rungs of a ladder built\\ninto the wall, and fumbling his uncertain way upward toward some region\\nof intenser stench where a hot, searing blast beat down against him.\\nBefore his eyes a kaleidoscopic range of fantasmal images played, all\\nof them dissolving at intervals into the picture of a vast, unplumbed\\nabyss of night wherein whirled suns and worlds of an even profounder\\nblackness. He thought of the ancient legends of Ultimate Chaos, at\\nwhose center sprawls the blind idiot god Azathoth, Lord of All Things,\\nencircled by his flopping horde of mindless and amorphous dancers,\\nand lulled by the thin monotonous piping of a demoniac flute held in\\nnameless paws.\\n\\nThen a sharp report from the outer world broke through his stupor and\\nroused him to the unutterable horror of his position. What it was, he\\nnever knewâ\\x80\\x94perhaps it was some belated peal from the fireworks heard\\nall summer on Federal Hill as the dwellers hail their various patron\\nsaints, or the saints of their native villages in Italy. In any event\\nhe shrieked aloud, dropped frantically from the ladder, and stumbled\\nblindly across the obstructed floor of the almost lightless chamber\\nthat encompassed him.\\n\\nHe knew instantly where he was, and plunged recklessly down the\\nnarrow spiral staircase, tripping and bruising himself at every turn.\\nThere was a nightmare flight through a vast cobwebbed nave whose\\nghostly arches reached up to realms of leering shadow, a sightless\\nscramble through a littered basement, a climb to regions of air and\\nstreet-lights outside, and a mad racing down a spectral hill of\\ngibbering gables, across a grim, silent city of tall black towers, and\\nup the steep eastward precipice to his own ancient door.\\n\\nOn regaining consciousness in the morning he found himself lying on\\nhis study floor fully dressed. Dirt and cobwebs covered him, and every\\ninch of his body seemed sore and bruised. When he faced the mirror he\\nsaw that his hair was badly scorched, while a trace of strange, evil\\nodor seemed to cling to his upper outer clothing. It was then that\\nhis nerves broke down. Thereafter, lounging exhaustedly about in a\\ndressing-gown, he did little but stare from his west window, shiver at\\nthe threat of thunder, and make wild entries in his diary.\\n\\nThe great storm broke just before midnight on August 8th. Lightning\\nstruck repeatedly in all parts of the city, and two remarkable\\nfireballs were reported. The rain was torrential, while a constant\\nfusillade of thunder brought sleeplessness to thousands. Blake was\\nutterly frantic in his fear for the lighting system, and tried to\\ntelephone the company around one a.m., though by that time service\\nhad been temporarily cut off in the interest of safety. He recorded\\neverything in his diaryâ\\x80\\x94the large, nervous, and often undecipherable\\nhieroglyphs telling their own story of growing frenzy and despair, and\\nof entries scrawled blindly in the dark.\\n\\nHe had to keep the house dark in order to see out the window, and it\\nappears that most of his time was spent at his desk, peering anxiously\\nthrough the rain across the glistening miles of downtown roofs at the\\nconstellation of distant lights marking Federal Hill. Now and then he\\nwould fumblingly make an entry in his diary, so that detached phrases\\nsuch as \"The lights must not go\"; \"It knows where I am\"; \"I must\\ndestroy it\"; and \"It is calling to me, but perhaps it means no injury\\nthis time\"; are found scattered down two of the pages.\\n\\nThen the lights went out all over the city. It happened at 2:12 a.m.\\naccording to power-house records, but Blake\\'s diary gives no indication\\nof the time. The entry is merely, \"Lights outâ\\x80\\x94God help me.\" On\\nFederal Hill there were watchers as anxious as he, and rain-soaked\\nknots of men paraded the square and alleys around the evil church\\nwith umbrella-shaded candles, electric flashlights, oil lanterns,\\ncrucifixes, and obscure charms of the many sorts common to southern\\nItaly. They blessed each flash of lightning, and made cryptical signs\\nof fear with their right hands when a turn in the storm caused the\\nflashes to lessen and finally to cease altogether. A rising wind\\nblew out most of the candles, so that the scene grew threateningly\\ndark. Someone roused Father Merluzzo of Spirito Santo Church, and he\\nhastened to the dismal square to pronounce whatever helpful syllables\\nhe could. Of the restless and curious sounds in the blackened tower,\\nthere could be no doubt whatever.\\n\\nFor what happened at 2:35 we have the testimony of the priest, a\\nyoung, intelligent, and well-educated person; of Patrolman William J.\\nMonahan of the Central Station, an officer of the highest reliability\\nwho had paused at that part of his beat to inspect the crowd; and of\\nmost of the seventy-eight men who had gathered around the church\\'s\\nhigh bank wallâ\\x80\\x94especially those in the square where the eastward\\nfaÃ§ade was visible. Of course there was nothing which can be proved\\nas being outside the order of nature. The possible causes of such an\\nevent are many. No one can speak with certainty of the obscure chemical\\nprocesses arising in a vast, ancient, ill-aired, and long-deserted\\nbuilding of heterogeneous contents. Mephitic vaporsâ\\x80\\x94spontaneous\\ncombustionâ\\x80\\x94pressure of gases born of long decayâ\\x80\\x94any one of numberless\\nphenomena might be responsible. And then, of course, the factor of\\nconscious charlatanry can by no means be excluded. The thing was really\\nquite simple in itself, and covered less than three minutes of actual\\ntime. Father Merluzzo, always a precise man, looked at his watch\\nrepeatedly.\\n\\nIt started with a definite swelling of the dull fumbling sounds inside\\nthe black tower. There had for some time been a vague exhalation of\\nstrange, evil odors from the church, and this had now become emphatic\\nand offensive. Then at last there was a sound of splintering wood, and\\na large, heavy object crashed down in the yard beneath the frowning\\neasterly faÃ§ade. The tower was invisible now that the candles would not\\nburn, but as the object neared the ground the people knew that it was\\nthe smoke-grimed louver-boarding of that tower\\'s east window.\\n\\nImmediately afterward an utterly unbearable fetor welled forth from\\nthe unseen heights, choking and sickening the trembling watchers,\\nand almost prostrating those in the square. At the same time the\\nair trembled with a vibration as of flapping wings, and a sudden\\neast-blowing wind more violent than any previous blast snatched off the\\nhats and wrenched the dripping umbrellas of the crowd. Nothing definite\\ncould be seen in the candleless night, though some upward-looking\\nspectators thought they glimpsed a great spreading blur of denser\\nblackness against the inky skyâ\\x80\\x94something like a formless cloud of\\nsmoke that shot with meteor-like speed toward the east.\\n\\nThat was all. The watchers were half numbed with fright, awe, and\\ndiscomfort, and scarcely knew what to do, or whether to do anything at\\nall. Not knowing what had happened, they did not relax their vigil;\\nand a moment later they sent up a prayer as a sharp flash of belated\\nlightning, followed by an ear-splitting crash of sound, rent the\\nflooded heavens. Half an hour later the rain stopped, and in fifteen\\nminutes more the street lights sprang on again, sending the weary,\\nbedraggled watchers relievedly back to their homes.\\n\\nThe next day\\'s papers gave these matters minor mention in connection\\nwith the general storm reports. It seems that the great lightning flash\\nand deafening explosion which followed the Federal Hill occurrence\\nwere even more tremendous farther east, where a burst of the singular\\nfetor was likewise noticed. The phenomenon was most marked over College\\nHill, where the crash awaked all the sleeping inhabitants and led to a\\nbewildered round of speculations. Of those who were already awake only\\na few saw the anomalous blaze of light near the top of the hill, or\\nnoticed the inexplicable upward rush of air which almost stripped the\\nleaves from the trees and blasted the plants in the gardens. It was\\nagreed that the lone, sudden lightning-bolt must have struck somewhere\\nin this neighborhood, though no trace of its striking could afterward\\nbe found. A youth in the Tau Omega fraternity house thought he saw a\\ngrotesque and hideous mass of smoke in the air just as the preliminary\\nflash burst, but his observation has not been verified. All of the few\\nobservers, however, agree as to the violent gust from the west and the\\nflood of intolerable stench which preceded the belated stroke; whilst\\nevidence concerning the momentary burned odor after the stroke is\\nequally general.\\n\\nThese points were discussed very carefully because of their probable\\nconnection with the death of Robert Blake. Students in the Psi Delta\\nhouse, whose upper rear windows looked into Blake\\'s study, noticed the\\nblurred white face at the westward window on the morning of the 9th,\\nand wondered what was wrong with the expression. When they saw the same\\nface in the same position that evening, they felt worried, and watched\\nfor the lights to come up in his apartment. Later they rang the bell of\\nthe darkened flat, and finally had a policeman force the door.\\n\\nThe rigid body sat bolt upright at the desk by the window, and when\\nthe intruders saw the glassy, bulging eyes, and the marks of stark,\\nconvulsive fright on the twisted features, they turned away in sickened\\ndismay. Shortly afterward the coroner\\'s physician made an examination,\\nand despite the unbroken window reported electrical shock, or nervous\\ntension induced by an electrical discharge, as the cause of death.\\nThe hideous expression he ignored altogether, deeming it a not\\nimprobable result of the profound shock as experienced by a person of\\nsuch abnormal imagination and unbalanced emotions. He deduced these\\nlatter qualities from the books, paintings, and manuscripts found in\\nthe apartment, and from the blindly scrawled entries in the diary on\\nthe desk. Blake had prolonged his frenzied jottings to the last, and\\nthe broken-pointed pencil was found clutched in his spasmodically\\ncontracted right hand.\\n\\nThe entries after the failure of the lights were highly disjointed,\\nand legible only in part. From them certain investigators have\\ndrawn conclusions differing greatly from the materialistic official\\nverdict, but such speculations have little chance for belief among\\nthe conservative. The case of these imaginative theorists has not\\nbeen helped by the action of superstitious Doctor Dexter, who threw\\nthe curious box and angled stoneâ\\x80\\x94an object certainly self-luminous\\nas seen in the black windowless steeple where it was foundâ\\x80\\x94into\\nthe deepest channel of Narragansett Bay. Excessive imagination and\\nneurotic unbalance on Blake\\'s part, aggravated by knowledge of the evil\\nbygone cult whose startling traces he had uncovered, form the dominant\\ninterpretation given those final frenzied jottings.

       "  'body': 'The Festival\\n\\nI was far from home, and the spell of the eastern sea was upon me.\\nIn the twilight I heard it pounding on the rocks, and I knew it lay\\njust over the hill where the twisting willows writhed against the\\nclearing sky and the first stars of evening. And because my fathers\\nhad called me to the old town beyond, I pushed on through the\\nshallow, new-fallen snow along the road that soared lonely up to\\nwhere Aldebaran twinkled among the trees; on toward the very ancient\\ntown I had never seen but often dreamed of.\\n\\nIt was the Yuletide, which men call Christmas, though they know in\\ntheir hearts it is older than Bethlehem and Babylon, older than\\nMemphis and mankind. It was the Yuletide, and I had come at last to\\nthe ancient sea town where my people had dwelt and kept festival in\\nthe elder time when festival was forbidden; where also they had\\ncommanded their sons to keep festival once every century, that the\\nmemory of primal secrets might not be forgotten. Mine were an old\\npeople, old even when this land was settled three hundred years\\nbefore. And they were strange, because they had come as dark,\\nfurtive folk from opiate southern gardens of orchids, and spoken\\nanother tongue before they learnt the tongue of the blue-eyed\\nfishers. And now they were scattered, and shared only the rituals of\\nmysteries that none living could understand. I was the only one who\\ncame back that night to the old fishing town as legend bade, for\\nonly the poor and the lonely remember.\\n\\nThen beyond the hillâ\\x80\\x99s crest I saw Kingsport outspread frostily in\\nthe gloaming; snowy Kingsport with its ancient vanes and steeples,\\nridgepoles and chimneypots, wharves and small bridges, willow trees\\nand graveyards; endless labyrinths of steep, narrow, crooked\\nstreets, and dizzy church-crowned central peak that time durst not\\ntouch; ceaseless mazes of colonial houses piled and scattered at all\\nangles and levels like a childâ\\x80\\x99s disordered blocks; antiquity\\nhovering on gray wings over winter-whitened gables and gambrel\\nroofs. And against the rotting wharves the sea pounded; the\\nsecretive, immemorial sea out of which the people had come in the\\nelder time.\\n\\nBeside the road at its crest a still higher summit rose, bleak and\\nwindswept, and I saw that it was a burying-ground where black\\ngravestones stuck ghoulishly through the snow like the decayed\\nfingernails of a gigantic corpse. The printless road was very\\nlonely, and sometimes I thought I heard a distant horrible creaking\\nas of a gibbet in the wind. They had hanged four kinsmen of mine for\\nwitchcraft in 1692, but I did not know just where.\\n\\nAs the road wound down the seaward slope I listened for the merry\\nsounds of a village at evening, but did not hear them. Then I\\nthought of the season, and felt that these old Puritan folk might\\nwell have Christmas customs strange to me, and full of silent\\nhearthside prayer. So after that I did not listen for merriment or\\nlook for wayfarers, but kept on down past the hushed, lighted\\nfarmhouses and shadowy stone walls to where the signs of ancient\\nshops and sea taverns creaked in the salt breeze, and the grotesque\\nknockers of pillared doorways glistened along deserted, unpaved\\nlanes in the light of little, curtained windows.\\n\\nI had seen maps of the town, and knew where to find the home of my\\npeople. It was told that I should be known and welcomed, for village\\nlegend lives long; so I hastened through Back Street to Circle\\nCourt, and across the fresh snow on the one full flagstone pavement\\nin the town, to where Green Lane leads off behind the Market House.\\nI was glad I had chosen to walk. The white village had seemed very\\nbeautiful from the hill; and now I was eager to knock at the door of\\nmy people, the seventh house on the left in Green Lane, with an\\nancient peaked roof and jutting second story, all built before 1650.\\n\\nThere were lights inside the house when I came upon it, and I saw\\nfrom the diamond window-panes that it must have been kept very close\\nto its antique state. The upper part overhung the narrow,\\ngrass-grown street and nearly met the overhanging part of the house\\nopposite, so that I was almost in a tunnel, with the low stone\\ndoorstep wholly free from snow. There was no sidewalk, but many\\nhouses had high doors reached by double flights of steps with iron\\nrailings. It was an odd scene, and because I was strange to New\\nEngland I had never known its like before. Though it pleased me, I\\nwould have relished it better if there had been footprints in the\\nsnow, and people in the streets, and a few windows without drawn\\ncurtains.\\n\\nWhen I sounded the archaic iron knocker I was half afraid. Some fear\\nhad been gathering in me, perhaps because of the strangeness of my\\nheritage, and the bleakness of the evening, and the queerness of the\\nsilence in that aged town of curious customs. And when my knock was\\nanswered I was fully afraid, because I had not heard any footsteps\\nbefore the door creaked open. But I was not afraid long, for the\\ngowned, slippered old man in the doorway had a bland face that\\nreassured me; and though he made signs that he was dumb, he wrote a\\nquaint and ancient welcome with the stylus and wax tablet he\\ncarried.\\n\\nHe beckoned me into a low, candlelit room with massive exposed\\nrafters and dark, stiff, sparse furniture of the seventeenth\\ncentury. The past was vivid there, for not an attribute was missing.\\nThere was a cavernous fireplace and a spinning-wheel at which a bent\\nold woman in loose wrapper and deep poke-bonnet sat back toward me,\\nsilently spinning despite the festive season. An infinite dampness\\nseemed upon the place, and I marveled that no fire should be\\nblazing. The high-backed settle faced the row of curtained windows\\nat the left, and seemed to be occupied, though I was not sure. I did\\nnot like everything about what I saw, and felt again the fear I had\\nhad. This fear grew stronger from what had before lessened it, for\\nthe more I looked at the old manâ\\x80\\x99s bland face, the more its very\\nblandness terrified me. The eyes never moved, and the skin was too\\nlike wax. Finally I was sure it was not a face at all, but a\\nfiendishly cunning mask. But the flabby hands, curiously gloved,\\nwrote genially on the tablet and told me I must wait a while before\\nI could be led to the place of festival.\\n\\nPointing to a chair, table, and pile of books, the old man now left,\\nthe room; and when I sat down to read I saw that the books were\\nhoary and moldy, and that they included old Morrysterâ\\x80\\x99s wild\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMarvels of Science,â\\x80\\x9d the terrible â\\x80\\x9cSaducismus Triumphatusâ\\x80\\x9d of\\nJoseph Glanvil, published in 1681, the shocking â\\x80\\x9cDaemonolatreiaâ\\x80\\x9d of\\nRemigius, printed in 1595 at Lyons, and worst of all, the\\nunmentionable â\\x80\\x9cNecronomiconâ\\x80\\x9d of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred, in\\nOlaus Wormiusâ\\x80\\x99 forbidden Latin translation: a book which I had never\\nseen, but of which I had heard monstrous things whispered. No one\\nspoke to me, but I could hear the creaking of signs in the wind\\noutside, and the whir of the wheel as the bonneted old woman\\ncontinued her silent spinning, spinning.\\n\\nI thought the room and the books and the people very morbid and\\ndisquieting, but because an old tradition of my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s had\\nsummoned me to strange feastings, I resolved to expect queer things.\\nSo I tried to read, and soon became tremblingly absorbed by\\nsomething I found in that accursed â\\x80\\x9cNecronomiconâ\\x80\\x9d; a thought and a\\nlegend too hideous for sanity or consciousness. But I disliked it\\nwhen I fancied I heard the closing of one of the windows that the\\nsettle faced, as if it had been stealthily opened. It had seemed to\\nfollow a whirring that was not of the old womanâ\\x80\\x99s spinning-wheel.\\nThis was not much, though, for the old woman was spinning very hard,\\nand the aged clock had been striking. After that I lost the feeling\\nthat there were persons on the settle, and was reading intently and\\nshudderingly when the old man came back booted and dressed in a\\nloose antique costume, and sat down on that very bench, so that I\\ncould not see him. It was certainly nervous waiting, and the\\nblasphemous book in my hands made it doubly so. When 11 oâ\\x80\\x99clock\\nstruck, however, the old man stood up, glided to a massive carved\\nchest in a corner, and got two hooded cloaks, one of which he\\ndonned, and the other of which he draped round the old woman, who\\nwas ceasing her monotonous spinning. Then they both started for the\\nouter door; the woman lamely creeping, and the old man, after\\npicking up the very book I had been reading, beckoning me as he drew\\nhis hood over that unmoving face or mask.\\n\\nWe went out into the moonless and tortuous network of that\\nincredibly ancient town; went out as the lights in the curtained\\nwindows disappeared one by one, and the Dog Star leered at the\\nthrong of cowled, cloaked figures that poured silently from every\\ndoorway and formed monstrous processions up this street and that,\\npast the creaking signs and antediluvian gables, the thatched roofs\\nand the diamond-paned windows; threading precipitous lanes where\\ndecaying houses overlapped and crumbled together, gliding across\\nopen courts and churchyards where the bobbing lanterns made eldritch\\ndrunken constellations.\\n\\nAmid these hushed throngs I followed my voiceless guides; jostled by\\nelbows that seemed preternaturally soft, and pressed by chests and\\nstomachs that seemed abnormally pulpy; but seeing never a face and\\nhearing never a word. Up, up, up, the eery columns slithered, and I\\nsaw that all the travelers were converging as they flowed near a\\nsort of focus of crazy alleys at the top of a high hill in the\\ncenter of the town, where perched a great white church. I had seen\\nit from the roadâ\\x80\\x99s crest when I looked at Kingsport in the new dusk,\\nand it had made me shiver because Aldebaran had seemed to balance\\nitself a moment on the ghostly spire.\\n\\nThere was an open space around the church; partly a churchyard with\\nspectral shafts, and partly a half-paved square swept nearly bare of\\nsnow by the wind, and lined with unwholesomely archaic houses having\\npeaked roofs and overhanging gables. Death-fires danced over the\\ntombs, revealing gruesome vistas, though queerly failing to cast any\\nshadows. Past the churchyard, where there were no houses, I could\\nsee over the hillâ\\x80\\x99s summit and watch the glimmer of stars on the\\nharbor, though the town was invisible in the dark. Only once in a\\nwhile a lantern bobbed horribly through serpentine alleys on its\\nway to overtake the throng that was now slipping speechlessly into\\nthe church.\\n\\nI waited till the crowd had oozed into the black doorway, and till\\nall the stragglers had followed. The old man was pulling at my\\nsleeve, but I was determined to be the last. Then finally I went,\\nthe sinister man and the old spinning woman before me. Crossing the\\nthreshold into that swarming temple of unknown darkness, I turned\\nonce to look at the outside world as the churchyard phosphorescence\\ncast a sickly glow on the hilltop pavement. And as I did so I\\nshuddered. For though the wind had not left much snow, a few patches\\ndid remain on the path near the door; and in that fleeting backward\\nlook it seemed to my troubled eye that they bore no mark of passing\\nfeet, not even mine.\\n\\nThe church was scarce lighted by all the lanterns that had entered\\nit, for most of the throng had already vanished. They had streamed\\nup the aisle between the high white pews to the trapdoor of the\\nvaults which yawned loathsomely open just before the pulpit, and\\nwere now squirming noiselessly in. I followed dumbly down the\\nfootworn steps and into the dank, suffocating crypt. The tail of\\nthat sinuous line of night-marchers seemed very horrible, and as I\\nsaw them wriggling into a venerable tomb, they seemed more horrible\\nstill. Then I noticed that the tombâ\\x80\\x99s floor had an aperture down\\nwhich the throng was sliding, and in a moment we were all descending\\nan ominous staircase of rough-hewn stone; a narrow spiral staircase\\ndamp and peculiarly odorous, that wound endlessly down into the\\nbowels of the hill, past monotonous walls of dripping stone blocks\\nand crumbling mortar. It was a silent, shocking descent, and I\\nobserved after a horrible interval that the walls and steps were\\nchanging in nature, as if chiseled out of the solid rock. What\\nmainly troubled me was that the myriad footfalls made no sound and\\nset up no echoes. After more eons of descent I saw some side\\npassages or burrows leading from unknown recesses of blackness to\\nthis shaft of nighted mystery. Soon they became excessively\\nnumerous, like impious catacombs of nameless menace; and their\\npungent odor of decay grew quite unbearable. I knew we must have\\npassed down through the mountain and beneath the earth of Kingsport\\nitself, and I shivered that a town should be so aged and maggoty\\nwith subterraneous evil.\\n\\nThen I saw the lurid shimmering of pale light, and heard the\\ninsidious lapping of sunless waters. Again I shivered, for I did not\\nlike the things that the night had brought, and wished bitterly that\\nno forefather had summoned me to this primal rite. As the steps and\\nthe passage grew broader, I heard another sound, the thin, whining\\nmockery of a feeble flute; and suddenly there spread out before me\\nthe boundless vista of an inner worldâ\\x80\\x94a vast fungous shore litten\\nby a belching column of sick greenish flame and washed by a wide\\noily river that flowed from abysses frightful and unsuspected to\\njoin the blackest gulfs of immemorial ocean.\\n\\nFainting and gasping, I looked at that unhallowed Erebus of titan\\ntoadstools, leprous fire and slimy water, and saw the cloaked\\nthrongs forming a semicircle around the blazing pillar. It was the\\nYule-rite, older than man and fated to survive him; the primal rite\\nof the solstice and of springâ\\x80\\x99s promise beyond the snows; the rite\\nof fire and evergreen, light and music. And in that Stygian grotto I\\nsaw them do the rite, and adore the sick pillar of flame, and throw\\ninto the water handfuls gouged out of the viscous vegetation which\\nglittered green in the chlorotic glare. I saw this, and I saw\\nsomething amorphously squatted far away from the light, piping\\nnoisomely on a flute; and as the thing piped I thought I heard\\nnoxious muffled flutterings in the fetid darkness where I could not\\nsee. But what frightened me most was that flaming column; spouting\\nvolcanically from depths profound and inconceivable, casting no\\nshadows as healthy flame should, and coating the nitrous stone above\\nwith a nasty, venomous verdigris. For in all that seething\\ncombustion no warmth lay, but only the clamminess of death and\\ncorruption.\\n\\nThe man who had brought me now squirmed to a point directly beside\\nthe hideous flame, and made stiff ceremonial motions to the\\nsemicircle he faced. At certain stages of the ritual they did\\ngroveling obeisance, especially when he held above his head that\\nabhorrent â\\x80\\x9cNecronomiconâ\\x80\\x9d he had taken with him; and I shared all the\\nobeisances because I had been summoned to this festival by the\\nwritings of my forefathers. Then the old man made a signal to the\\nhalf-seen flute-player in the darkness, which player thereupon\\nchanged its feeble drone to a scarce louder drone in another key;\\nprecipitating as it did so a horror unthinkable and unexpected. At\\nthis horror I sank nearly to the lichened earth, transfixed with a\\ndread not of this nor any world, but only of the mad spaces between\\nthe stars.\\n\\nOut of the unimaginable blackness beyond the gangrenous glare of\\nthat cold flame, out of the tartarean leagues through which that\\noily river rolled uncanny, unheard, and unsuspected, there flopped\\nrhythmically a horde of tame, trained, hybrid winged things that no\\nsound eye could ever wholly grasp, or sound brain ever wholly\\nremember. They were not altogether crows, nor moles, nor buzzards,\\nnor ants, nor vampire bats, nor decomposed human beings, but\\nsomething I cannot and must not recall. They flopped limply along,\\nhalf with their webbed feet and half with their membranous wings;\\nand as they reached the throng of celebrants the cowled figures\\nseized and mounted them, and rode off one by one along the reaches\\nof that unlighted river, into pits and galleries of panic where\\npoison springs feed frightful and undiscoverable cataracts.\\n\\nThe old spinning woman had gone with the throng, and the old man\\nremained only because I had refused when he motioned me to seize an\\nanimal and ride like the rest. I saw when I staggered to my feet\\nthat the amorphous flute-player had rolled out of sight, but that\\ntwo of the beasts were patiently standing by. As I hung back, the\\nold man produced his stylus and tablet and wrote that he was the\\ntrue deputy of my fathers who had founded the Yule worship in this\\nancient place; that it had been decreed I should come back; and that\\nthe most secret mysteries were yet to be performed. He wrote this in\\na very ancient hand, and when I still hesitated he pulled from his\\nloose robe a seal ring and a watch, both with my family arms, to\\nprove that he was what he said. But it was a hideous proof, because\\nI knew from old papers that that watch had been buried with my\\ngreat-great-great-great-grandfather in 1698.\\n\\nPresently the old man drew back his hood and pointed to the family\\nresemblance in his face, but I only shuddered, because I was sure\\nthat the face was merely a devilish waxen mask. The flopping animals\\nwere now scratching restlessly at the lichens, and I saw that the\\nold man was nearly as restless himself. When one of the things began\\nto waddle and edge away, he turned quickly to stop it; so that the\\nsuddenness of his motion dislodged the waxen mask from what should\\nhave been his head. And then, because that nightmareâ\\x80\\x99s position\\nbarred me from the stone staircase down which we had come, I flung\\nmyself into the oily underground river that bubbled somewhere to the\\ncaves of the sea; flung myself into that putrescent juice of earthâ\\x80\\x99s\\ninner horrors before the madness of my screams could bring down upon\\nme all the charnel legions these pest-gulfs might conceal.\\n\\nAt the hospital they told me I had been found half-frozen in\\nKingsport Harbor at dawn, clinging to the drifting spar that\\naccident sent to save me. They told me I had taken the wrong fork of\\nthe hill road the night before, and fallen over the cliffs at Orange\\nPointâ\\x80\\x94a thing they deducted from prints found in the snow. There was\\nnothing I could say, because everything was wrong. Everything was\\nwrong, with the broad window showing a sea of roofs in which only\\nabout one in five was ancient, and the sound of trolleys and motors\\nin the streets below. They insisted that this was Kingsport, and I\\ncould not deny it.\\n\\nWhen I went delirious at hearing that the hospital stood near the\\nold churchyard on Central Hill, they sent me to St. Maryâ\\x80\\x99s Hospital\\nin Arkham, where I could have better care. I liked it there, for the\\ndoctors were broadminded, and even lent me their influence in\\nobtaining the carefully sheltered copy of Alhazredâ\\x80\\x99s objectionable\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNecronomiconâ\\x80\\x9d from the library of Miskatonic University. They said\\nsomething about a â\\x80\\x9cpsychosis,â\\x80\\x9d and agreed that I had better get my\\nharassing obsessions off my mind.\\n\\nSo I read again that hideous chapter, and shuddered doubly because\\nit was indeed not new to me. I had seen it before, let footprints\\ntell what they might; and where it was I had seen it were best\\nforgotten. There was no oneâ\\x80\\x94in waking hoursâ\\x80\\x94who could remind me of\\nit; but my dreams are filled with terror, because of phrases I dare\\nnot quote. I dare quote only one paragraph, put into such English as\\nI can make from the awkward Low Latin.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe nethermost caverns,â\\x80\\x9d wrote the mad Arab, â\\x80\\x9care not for the\\nfathoming of eyes that see; for their marvels are strange and\\nterrific. Cursed the ground where dead thoughts live new and oddly\\nbodied, and evil the mind that is held by no head. Wisely did Ibn\\nSchacabac say that happy is the tomb where no wizard hath lain, and\\nhappy the town at night whose wizards are all in ashes. For it is of\\nold rumor that the soul of the devil-bought hastes not from his\\ncharnel clay, but fats and instructs the very worm that gnaws ;\\ntill out of corruption horrid life springs, and the dull scavengers\\nof earth wax crafty to vex it and swell monstrous to plague it.\\nGreat holes secretly are digged where earthâ\\x80\\x99s pores ought to\\nsuffice, and things have learnt to walk that ought to crawl.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTranscriberâ\\x80\\x99s Note: This story appeared in\\n  the January 1925 issue of Weird Tales Magazine .',\n",

It is much more than a mere\\npiece of fiction, for it so far transcends human experiences, and even\\nthe wildest dreams of human beings, that the ideas and thoughts set\\nforth in the tale are titanic. One searches the dictionaries in vain\\nfor words to describe this brilliant and astounding tale, which for\\nsheer imaginative daring goes beyond anything ever printed before. It\\nis the joint product of two of your most popular authors.\\n\\n[Transcriber\\'s Note: This etext was produced from Weird Tales July 1934. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\\n\\nCHAPTER 1\\n\\nIn a vast room hung with strangely figured arras and carpeted with\\nBoukhara rugs of impressive age and workmanship, four men were sitting\\naround a document-strown table. From the far corners, where odd tripods\\nof wrought iron were now and then replenished by an incredibly aged\\nnegro in somber livery, came the hypnotic fumes of olibanum; while in\\na deep niche on one side there ticked a curious, coffin-shaped clock\\nwhose dial bore baffling hieroglyphs and whose four hands did not move\\nin consonance with any time system known on this planet. It was a\\nsingular and disturbing room, but well fitted to the business then at\\nhand. For there, in the New Orleans home of this continent\\'s greatest\\nmystic, mathematician and orientalist, there was being settled at last\\nthe estate of a scarcely less great mystic, scholar, author and dreamer\\nwho had vanished from the face of the earth four years before.\\n\\nRandolph Carter, who had all his life sought to escape from the tedium\\nand limitations of waking reality in the beckoning vistas of dreams\\nand fabled avenues of other dimensions, disappeared from the sight\\nof man on the seventh of October, 1928, at the age of fifty-four.\\nHis career had been a strange and lonely one, and there were those\\nwho inferred from his curious novels many episodes more bizarre than\\nany in his recorded history. His association with Harley Warren, the\\nSouth Carolina mystic whose studies in the primal Naacal language of\\nthe Himalayan priests had led to such outrageous conclusions, had\\nbeen close. Indeed, it was he whoâ\\x80\\x94one mist-mad, terrible night in an\\nancient graveyardâ\\x80\\x94had seen Warren descend into a dank and nitrous\\nvault, never to emerge. Carter lived in Boston, but it was from the\\nwild, haunted hills behind hoary and witch-accursed Arkham that all his\\nforebears had come. And it was amid these ancient, cryptically brooding\\nhills that he had ultimately vanished.\\n\\nHis old servant, Parksâ\\x80\\x94who died early in 1930â\\x80\\x94had spoken of the\\nstrangely aromatic and hideously carven box he had found in the attic,\\nand of the undecipherable parchments and queerly figured silver key\\nwhich that box had contained: matters of which Carter had also written\\nto others. Carter, he said, had told him that this key had come down\\nfrom his ancestors, and that it would help him to unlock the gates to\\nhis lost boyhood, and to strange dimensions and fantastic realms which\\nhe had hitherto visited only in vague, brief and elusive dreams. Then\\none day Carter took the box and its contents and rode away in his car, never to return.\\n\\nLater on, people found the car at the side of an old, grass-grown\\nroad in the hills behind crumbling Arkhamâ\\x80\\x94the hills where Carter\\'s\\nforebears had once dwelt, and where the ruined cellar of the great\\nCarter homestead still gaped to the sky. It was in a grove of tall elms\\nnear by that another of the Carters had mysteriously vanished in 1781,\\nand not far away was the half-rotted cottage where Goody Fowler, the\\nwitch, had brewed her ominous potions still earlier. The region had\\nbeen settled in 1692 by fugitives from the witchcraft trials in Salem,\\nand even now it bore a name for vaguely ominous things scarcely to be\\nenvisaged. Edmund Carter had fled from the shadow of Gallows Hill just\\nin time, and the tales of his sorceries were many. Now, it seemed, his\\nlone descendant had gone somewhere to join him!\\n\\nIn the car they found the hideously carved box of fragrant wood,\\nand the parchment which no man could read. The silver key was\\ngoneâ\\x80\\x94presumably with Carter. Further than that there was no certain\\nclue. Detectives from Boston said that the fallen timbers of the old\\nCarter place seemed oddly disturbed, and somebody found a handkerchief\\non the rock-ridged, sinisterly wooded slope behind the ruins near the\\ndreaded cave called the Snake Den.\\n\\nIt was then that the country legends about the Snake Den gained a new\\nvitality. Farmers whispered of the blasphemous uses to which old Edmund\\nCarter the wizard had put that horrible grotto, and added later tales\\nabout the fondness which Randolph Carter himself had had for it when\\na boy. In Carter\\'s boyhood the venerable gambrel-roofed homestead was\\nstill standing and tenanted by his great-uncle Christopher. He had\\nvisited there often, and had talked singularly about the Snake Den.\\nPeople remembered what he had said about a deep fissure and an unknown\\ninner cave beyond, and speculated on the change he had shown after\\nspending one whole memorable day in the cavern when he was nine. That\\nwas in October, tooâ\\x80\\x94and ever after that he had seemed to have an\\nuncanny knack at prophesying future events.\\n\\nIt had rained late in the night that Carter vanished, and no one was\\nquite able to trace his footprints from the car. Inside the Snake Den\\nall was amorphous liquid mud, owing to the copious seepage. Only the\\nignorant rustics whispered about the prints they thought they spied\\nwhere the great elms overhang the road, and on the sinister hillside\\nnear the Snake Den, where the handkerchief was found. Who could pay\\nattention to whispers that spoke of stubby little tracks like those\\nwhich Randolph Carter\\'s square-toed boots made when he was a small boy?\\nIt was as crazy a notion as that other whisperâ\\x80\\x94that the tracks of old\\nBenijah Corey\\'s peculiar heelless boots had met the stubby little\\ntracks in the road. Old Benijah had been the Carters\\' hired man when\\nRandolph was young; but he had died thirty years ago.\\n\\nIt must have been these whispersâ\\x80\\x94plus Carter\\'s own statement to Parks\\nand others that the queerly arabesqued silver key would help him unlock\\nthe gates of his lost boyhoodâ\\x80\\x94which caused a number of mystical\\nstudents to declare that the missing man had actually doubled back on\\nthe trail of time and returned through forty-five years to that other\\nOctober day in 1883 when he had stayed in the Snake Den as a small boy.\\nWhen he came out that night, they argued, he had somehow made the whole\\ntrip to 1928 and back; for did he not thereafter know of things which\\nwere to happen later? And yet he had never spoken of anything to happen\\nafter 1928.\\n\\nOne studentâ\\x80\\x94an elderly eccentric of Providence, Rhode Island, who\\nhad enjoyed a long and close correspondence with Carterâ\\x80\\x94had a still\\nmore elaborate theory, and believed that Carter had not only returned\\nto boyhood, but achieved a further liberation, roving at will through\\nthe prismatic vistas of boyhood dream. After a strange vision this man\\npublished a tale of Carter\\'s vanishing in which he hinted that the lost\\none now reigned as king on the opal throne of Ilek-Vad, that fabulous\\ntown of turrets atop the hollow cliffs of glass overlooking the\\ntwilight sea wherein the bearded and finny Gnorri build their singular\\nlabyrinths.\\n\\nIt was this old man, Ward Phillips, who pleaded most loudly against the\\napportionment of Carter\\'s estate to his heirsâ\\x80\\x94all distant cousinsâ\\x80\\x94on\\nthe ground that he was still alive in another time-dimension and might\\nwell return some day. Against him was arrayed the legal talent of\\none of the cousins, Ernest K. Aspinwall of Chicago, a man ten years\\nCarter\\'s senior, but keen as a youth in forensic battles. For four\\nyears the contest had raged, but now the time for apportionment had\\ncome, and this vast, strange room in New Orleans was to be the scene of\\nthe arrangements.\\n\\nIt was the home of Carter\\'s literary and financial executorâ\\x80\\x94the\\ndistinguished Creole student of mysteries and Eastern antiquities,\\nEtienne-Laurent de Marigny. Carter had met de Marigny during the war,\\nwhen they both served in the French Foreign Legion, and had at once\\ncleaved to him because of their similar tastes and outlook. When, on\\na memorable joint furlough, the learned young Creole had taken the\\nwistful Boston dreamer to Bayonne, in the south of France, and had\\nshown him certain terrible secrets in the nighted and immemorial crypts\\nthat burrow beneath that brooding, eon-weighted city, the friendship\\nwas forever sealed. Carter\\'s will had named de Marigny as executor, and\\nnow that avid scholar was reluctantly presiding over the settlement of\\nthe estate. It was sad work for him, for like the old Rhode Islander he\\ndid not believe that Carter was dead. But what weight have the dreams\\nof mystics against the harsh wisdom of the world?\\n\\nAround the table in that strange room in the old French Quarter sat\\nthe men who claimed an interest in the proceedings. There had been\\nthe usual legal advertisements of the conference in papers wherever\\nCarter\\'s heirs were thought to live; yet only four now sat listening\\nto the abnormal ticking of that coffin-shaped clock which told no\\nearthly time, and to the bubbling of the courtyard fountain beyond\\nhalf-curtained, fan-lighted windows. As the hours wore on, the faces\\nof the four were half shrouded in the curling fumes from the tripods,\\nwhich, piled recklessly with fuel, seemed to need less and less\\nattention from the silently gliding and increasingly nervous old negro.\\n\\nThere was Etienne de Marigny himselfâ\\x80\\x94slim, dark, handsome, mustached,\\nand still young. Aspinwall, representing the heirs, was white-haired,\\napoplectic-faced, side-whiskered, and portly. Phillips, the Providence\\nmystic, was lean, gray, long-nosed, clean-shaven, and stoop-shouldered.\\nThe fourth man was non-committal in ageâ\\x80\\x94lean, with a dark, bearded,\\nsingularly immobile face of very regular contour, bound with the\\nturban of a high-caste Brahman and having night-black, burning, almost\\nirisless eyes which seemed to gaze out from a vast distance behind\\nthe features. He had announced himself as the Swami Chandraputra, an\\nadept from Benares, with important information to give; and both de\\nMarigny and Phillipsâ\\x80\\x94who had corresponded with himâ\\x80\\x94had been quick to\\nrecognize the genuineness of his mystical pretensions. His speech had\\nan oddly forced, hollow, metallic quality, as if the use of English\\ntaxed his vocal apparatus; yet his language was as easy, correct and\\nidiomatic as any native Anglo-Saxon\\'s. In general attire he was the\\nnormal European civilian, but his loose clothes sat peculiarly badly\\non him, while his bushy black beard, Eastern turban, and large, white\\nmittens gave him an air of exotic eccentricity.\\n\\nDe Marigny, fingering the parchment found in Carter\\'s car, was speaking.\\n\\n\"No, I have not been able to make anything of the parchment. Mr.\\nPhillips, here, also gives it up. Colonel Churchward declares it is\\nnot Naacal, and it looks nothing at all like the hieroglyphics on that\\nEaster Island war-club. The carvings on that box, though, do strongly\\nsuggest Easter Island images. The nearest thing I can recall to these\\nparchment charactersâ\\x80\\x94notice how all the letters seem to hang down\\nfrom horizontal word-barsâ\\x80\\x94is the writing in a book poor Harley Warren\\nonce had. It came from India while Carter and I were visiting him in\\n1919, and he never would tell us anything about itâ\\x80\\x94said it would be\\nbetter if we didn\\'t know, and hinted that it might have come originally\\nfrom some place other than the Earth. He took it with him in December,\\nwhen he went down into the vault in that old graveyardâ\\x80\\x94but neither\\nhe nor the book ever came to the surface again. Some time ago I sent\\nour friend hereâ\\x80\\x94the Swami Chandraputraâ\\x80\\x94a memory-sketch of some of\\nthose letters, and also a photostatic copy of the Carter parchment. He\\nbelieves he may be able to shed light on them after certain references\\nand consultations.\\n\\n\"But the keyâ\\x80\\x94Carter sent me a photograph of that. Its curious\\narabesques were not letters, but seem to have belonged to the same\\nculture-tradition as the parchment. Carter always spoke of being on\\nthe point of solving the mystery, though he never gave details. Once\\nhe grew almost poetic about the whole business. That antique silver\\nkey, he said, would unlock the successive doors that bar our free\\nmarch down the mighty corridors of space and time to the very Border\\nwhich no man has crossed since Shaddad with his terrific genius\\nbuilt and concealed in the sands of Arabia PetrÃ¦a the prodigious\\ndomes and uncounted minarets of thousand-pillared Irem. Half-starved\\ndarvishesâ\\x80\\x94wrote Carterâ\\x80\\x94and thirst-crazed nomads have returned to tell\\nof that monumental portal, and of the hand that is sculptured above the\\nkeystone of the arch, but no man has passed and retraced his steps to\\nsay that his footprints on the garnet-strown sands within bear witness\\nto his visit. The key, he surmised, was that for which the cyclopean\\nsculptured hand vainly grasps.\\n\\n\"Why Carter didn\\'t take the parchment as well as the key, we can not\\nsay. Perhaps he forgot itâ\\x80\\x94or perhaps he forbore to take it through\\nrecollection of one who had taken a book of like characters into a\\nvault and never returned. Or perhaps it was really immaterial to what\\nhe wished to do.\"\\n\\nAs de Marigny paused, old Mr. Phillips spoke in a harsh, shrill voice.\\n\\n\"We can know of Randolph Carter\\'s wandering only what we dream. I have\\nbeen to many strange places in dreams, and have heard many strange and\\nsignificant things in Ulthar, beyond the River Skai. It does not appear\\nthat the parchment was needed, for certainly Carter re-entered the\\nworld of his boyhood dreams, and is now a king in Ilek-Vad.\"\\n\\nMr. Aspinwall grew doubly apoplectic-looking as he sputtered: \"Can\\'t\\nsomebody shut that old fool up? We\\'ve had enough of these moonings. The\\nproblem is to divide the property, and it\\'s about time we got to it.\"\\n\\nFor the first time Swami Chandraputra spoke in his queerly alien voice.\\n\\n\"Gentlemen, there is more to this matter than you think. Mr. Aspinwall\\ndoes not do well to laugh at the evidence of dreams. Mr. Phillips has\\ntaken an incomplete viewâ\\x80\\x94perhaps because he has not dreamed enough.\\nI, myself, have done much dreaming. We in India have always done that,\\njust as all the Carters seem to have done it. You, Mr. Aspinwall, as a\\nmaternal cousin, are naturally not a Carter. My own dreams, and certain\\nother sources of information, have told me a great deal which you\\nstill find obscure. For example, Randolph Carter forgot that parchment\\nwhich he couldn\\'t decipherâ\\x80\\x94yet it would have been well for him had he\\nremembered to take it. You see, I have really learned pretty much what\\nhappened to Carter after he left his car with the silver key at sunset\\non that seventh of October, four years ago.\"\\n\\nAspinwall audibly sneered, but the others sat up with heightened\\ninterest. The smoke from the tripods increased, and the crazy ticking\\nof that coffin-shaped clock seemed to fall into bizarre patterns like\\nthe dots and dashes of some alien and insoluble telegraph message\\nfrom outer space. The Hindoo leaned back, half closed his eyes, and\\ncontinued in that oddly labored yet idiomatic speech, while before\\nhis audience there began to float a picture of what had happened to\\nRandolph Carter.\\n\\nCHAPTER 2\\n\\nThe hills beyond Arkham are full of a strange magicâ\\x80\\x94something,\\nperhaps, which the old wizard Edmund Carter called down from the stars\\nand up from the crypts of nether earth when he fled there from Salem\\nin 1692. As soon as Randolph Carter was back among them he knew that\\nhe was close to one of the gates which a few audacious, abhorred and\\nalien-souled men have blasted through titan walls betwixt the world\\nand the outside absolute. Here, he felt, and on this day of the year,\\nhe could carry out with success the message he had deciphered months\\nbefore from the arabesques of that tarnished and incredibly ancient\\nsilver key. He knew now how it must be rotated, and how it must be held\\nup to the setting sun, and what syllables of ceremony must be intoned\\ninto the void at the ninth and last turning. In a spot as close to\\na dark polarity and induced gate as this, it could not fail in its\\nprimary functions. Certainly, he would rest that night in the lost\\nboyhood for which he had never ceased to mourn.\\n\\nHe got out of the car with the key in his pocket, walking up-hill\\ndeeper and deeper into the shadowy core of that brooding, haunted\\ncountryside of winding road, vine-grown stone wall, black woodland,\\ngnarled, neglected orchard, gaping-windowed, deserted farmhouse, and\\nnameless ruin. At the sunset hour, when the distant spires of Kingsport\\ngleamed in the ruddy blaze, he took out the key and made the needed\\nturnings and intonations. Only later did he realize how soon the ritual\\nhad taken effect.\\n\\nThen in the deepening twilight he had heard a voice out of the past:\\nOld Benijah Corey, his great-uncle\\'s hired man. Had not old Benijah\\nbeen dead for thirty years? Thirty years before when ? What was time?\\nWhere had he been? Why was it strange that Benijah should be calling\\nhim on this seventh of October, 1883? Was he not out later than Aunt\\nMartha had told him to stay? What was this key in his blouse pocket,\\nwhere his little telescopeâ\\x80\\x94given him by his father on his ninth\\nbirthday, two months beforeâ\\x80\\x94ought to be? Had he found it in the attic\\nat home? Would it unlock the mystic pylon which his sharp eye had\\ntraced amidst the jagged rocks at the back of that inner cave behind\\nthe Snake Den on the hill? That was the place they always coupled with\\nold Edmund Carter the wizard. People wouldn\\'t go there, and nobody but\\nhim had ever noticed or squirmed through the root-choked fissure to\\nthat great black inner chamber with the pylon. Whose hands had carved\\nthat hint of a pylon out of the living rock? Old Wizard Edmund\\'sâ\\x80\\x94or others that he had conjured up and commanded?\\n\\nThat evening little Randolph ate supper with Uncle Chris and Aunt\\nMartha in the old gambrel-roofed farmhouse.\\n\\nNext morning he was up early and out through the twisted-boughed apple\\norchard to the upper timber-lot where the mouth of the Snake Den\\nlurked black and forbidding amongst grotesque, over-nourished oaks. A\\nnameless expectancy was upon him, and he did not even notice the loss\\nof his handkerchief as he fumbled in his blouse pocket to see if the\\nqueer silver key was safe. He crawled through the dark orifice with\\ntense, adventurous assurance, lighting his way with matches taken\\nfrom the sitting-room. In another moment he had wriggled through the\\nroot-choked fissure at the farther end, and was in the vast, unknown\\ninner grotto whose ultimate rock wall seemed half like a monstrous and\\nconsciously shapen pylon. Before that dank, dripping wall he stood\\nsilent and awestruck, lighting one match after another as he gazed.\\nWas that stony bulge above the keystone of the imagined arch really a\\ngigantic sculptured hand? Then he drew forth the silver key, and made\\nmotions and intonations whose source he could only dimly remember. Was\\nanything forgotten? He knew only that he wished to cross the barrier to\\nthe untrammelled land of his dreams and the gulfs where all dimensions\\ndissolved in the absolute.\\n\\nCHAPTER 3\\n\\nWhat happened then is scarcely to be described in words. It is full of\\nthose paradoxes, contradictions and anomalies which have no place in\\nwaking life, but which fill our more fantastic dreams and are taken as\\nmatters of course till we return to our narrow, rigid, objective world\\nof limited causation and tri-dimensional logic. As the Hindoo continued\\nhis tale, he had difficulty in avoiding what seemedâ\\x80\\x94even more than\\nthe notion of a man transferred through the years to boyhoodâ\\x80\\x94an air\\nof trivial, puerile extravagance. Mr. Aspinwall, in disgust, gave an\\napoplectic snort and virtually stopped listening.\\n\\nFor the rite of the silver key, as practised by Randolph Carter in that\\nblack, haunted cave within a cave, did not prove unavailing. From the\\nfirst gesture and syllable an aura of strange, awesome mutation was\\napparentâ\\x80\\x94a sense of incalculable disturbance and confusion in time\\nand space, yet one which held no hint of what we recognize as motion\\nand duration. Imperceptibly, such things as age and location ceased\\nto have any significance whatever. The day before, Randolph Carter\\nhad miraculously leaped a gulf of years. Now there was no distinction\\nbetween boy and man. There was only the entity Randolph Carter, with a\\ncertain store of images which had lost all connection with terrestrial\\nscenes and circumstances of acquisition. A moment before, there had\\nbeen an inner cave with vague suggestions of a monstrous arch and\\ngigantic sculptured hand on the farther wall. Now there was neither\\ncave nor absence of cave; neither wall nor absence of wall. There was\\nonly a flux of impressions not so much visual as cerebral, amidst\\nwhich the entity that was Randolph Carter experienced perceptions or\\nregistrations of all that his mind revolved on, yet without any clear\\nconsciousness of the way in which he received them.\\n\\nBy the time the rite was over, Carter knew that he was in no region\\nwhose place could be told by Earth\\'s geographers, and in no age whose\\ndate history could fix; for the nature of what was happening was not\\nwholly unfamiliar to him. There were hints of it in the cryptical\\nPnakotic fragments, and a whole chapter in the forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab, Abdul Alhazred, had taken on significance when he\\nhad deciphered the designs graven on the silver key. A gate had been\\nunlockedâ\\x80\\x94not, indeed, the Ultimate Gate, but one leading from Earth\\nand time to that extension of Earth which is outside time, and from\\nwhich in turn the Ultimate Gate leads fearsomely and perilously to the\\nLast Void which is outside all earths, all universes, and all matter.\\n\\nThere would be a Guideâ\\x80\\x94and a very terrible one; a Guide who had been\\nan entity of Earth millions of years before, when man was undreamed of,\\nand when forgotten shapes moved on a steaming planet building strange\\ncities among whose last, crumbling ruins the first mammals were to\\nplay. Carter remembered what the monstrous Necronomicon had vaguely\\nand disconcertingly adumbrated concerning that Guide:\\n\\n\" And while there are those ,\" the mad Arab had written, \" who have\\ndared to seek glimpses beyond the Veil, and to accept HIM as guide,\\nthey would have been more prudent had they avoided commerce with HIM;\\nfor it is written in the Book of Thoth how terrific is the price of\\na single glimpse. Nor may those who pass ever return, for in the\\nvastnesses transcending our world are shapes of darkness that seize\\nand bind. The Affair that shambleth about in the night, the evil that\\ndefieth the Elder Sign, the Herd that stand watch at the secret portal\\neach tomb is known to have, and that thrive on that which groweth out\\nof the tenants thereof:â\\x80\\x94all these Blacknesses are lesser than HE WHO\\nguardeth the Gateway: HE WHO will guide the rash one beyond all the\\nworlds into the Abyss of unnamable devourers. For HE is \\'UMR AT-TAWIL,\\nthe Most Ancient One, which the scribe rendereth as THE PROLONGED OF\\nLIFE. \"\\n\\nMemory and imagination shaped dim half-pictures with uncertain outlines\\namidst the seething chaos, but Carter knew that they were of memory and\\nimagination only. Yet he felt that it was not chance which built these\\nthings in his consciousness, but rather some vast reality, ineffable\\nand undimensioned, which surrounded him and strove to translate itself\\ninto the only symbols he was capable of grasping. For no mind of Earth\\nmay grasp the extensions of shape which interweave in the oblique gulfs\\noutside time and the dimensions we know.\\n\\nThere floated before Carter a cloudy pageantry of shapes and scenes\\nwhich he somehow linked with Earth\\'s primal, eon-forgotten past.\\nMonstrous living things moved deliberately through vistas of fantastic\\nhandiwork that no sane dream ever held, and landscapes bore incredible\\nvegetation and cliffs and mountains and masonry of no human pattern.\\nThere were cities under the sea, and denizens thereof; and towers in\\ngreat deserts where globes and cylinders and nameless winged entities\\nshot off into space, or hurtled down out of space. All this Carter\\ngrasped, though the images bore no fixed relation to one another or to\\nhim. He himself had no stable form or position, but only such shifting\\nhints of form and position as his whirling fancy supplied.\\n\\nHe had wished to find the enchanted regions of his boyhood dreams,\\nwhere galleys sail up the river Oukranos past the gilded spires of\\nThran, and elephant caravans tramp through perfumed jungles in Kled,\\nbeyond forgotten palaces with veined ivory columns that sleep lovely\\nand unbroken under the moon. Now, intoxicated with wider visions, he\\nscarcely knew what he sought. Thoughts of infinite and blasphemous\\ndaring rose in his mind, and he knew he would face the dreaded Guide\\nwithout fear, asking monstrous and terrible things of him.\\n\\nAll at once the pageant of impressions seemed to achieve a vague kind\\nof stabilization. There were great masses of towering stone, carven\\ninto alien and incomprehensible designs and disposed according to\\nthe laws of some unknown, inverse geometry. Light filtered down from\\na sky of no assignable color in baffling, contradictory directions,\\nand played almost sentiently over what seemed to be a curved line of\\ngigantic hieroglyphed pedestals more hexagonal than otherwise, and\\nsurmounted by cloaked, ill-defined shapes.\\n\\nThere was another shape, too, which occupied no pedestal, but which\\nseemed to glide or float over the cloudy, floor-like lower level. It\\nwas not exactly permanent in outline, but held transient suggestions of\\nsomething remotely preceding or paralleling the human form, though half\\nas large again as an ordinary man. It seemed to be heavily cloaked,\\nlike the shapes on the pedestals, with some neutral-colored fabric;\\nand Carter could not detect any eye-holes through which it might gaze.\\nProbably it did not need to gaze, for it seemed to belong to an order\\nof beings far outside the merely physical in organization and faculties.\\n\\nA moment later Carter knew that this was so, for the Shape had spoken\\nto his mind without sound or language. And though the name it uttered\\nwas a dreaded and terrible one, Randolph Carter did not flinch in fear.\\nInstead, he spoke back, equally without sound or language, and made\\nthose obeisances which the hideous Necronomicon had taught him to\\nmake. For this shape was nothing less than that which all the world has\\nfeared since Lomar rose out of the sea, and the Children of the Fire\\nMist came to Earth to teach the Elder Lore to man. It was indeed the\\nfrightful Guide and Guardian of the Gateâ\\x80\\x94\\'UMR AT-TAWIL, the ancient\\none, which the scribe rendereth the PROLONGED OF LIFE.\\n\\nThe Guide knew, as he knew all things, of Carter\\'s quest and coming,\\nand that this seeker of dreams and secrets stood before him unafraid.\\nThere was no horror or malignity in what he radiated, and Carter\\nwondered for a moment whether the mad Arab\\'s terrific blasphemous hints\\ncame from envy and a baffled wish to do what was now about to be done.\\nOr perhaps the Guide reserved his horror and malignity for those who\\nfeared. As the radiations continued, Carter eventually interpreted them\\nin the form of words.\\n\\n\"I am indeed that Most Ancient One,\" said the Guide, \"of whom you know.\\nWe have awaited youâ\\x80\\x94the Ancient Ones and I. You are welcome, even\\nthough long delayed. You have the key, and have unlocked the First\\nGate. Now the Ultimate Gate is ready for your trial. If you fear, you\\nneed not advance. You may still go back unharmed, the way you came. But\\nif you choose to advanceâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94\"\\n\\nThe pause was ominous, but the radiations continued to be friendly.\\nCarter hesitated not a moment, for a burning curiosity drove him on.\\n\\n\"I will advance,\" he radiated back, \"and I accept you as my Guide.\"\\n\\nAt this reply the Guide seemed to make a sign by certain motions of his\\nrobe which may or may not have involved the lifting of an arm or some\\nhomologous member. A second sign followed, and from his well-learned\\nlore Carter knew that he was at last very close to the Ultimate Gate.\\nThe light now changed to another inexplicable color, and the shapes on\\nthe quasi-hexagonal pedestals became more clearly defined. As they sat\\nmore erect, their outlines became more like those of men, though Carter\\nknew that they could not be men. Upon their cloaked heads there now\\nseemed to rest tall, uncertainly colored miters, strangely suggestive\\nof those on certain nameless figures chiselled by a forgotten sculptor\\nalong the living cliffs of a high, forbidden mountain in Tartary; while\\ngrasped in certain folds of their swathings were long scepters whose\\ncarven heads bodied forth a grotesque and archaic mystery.\\n\\nCarter guessed what they were and whence they came, and Whom they\\nserved; and guessed, too, the price of their service. But he was still\\ncontent, for at one mighty venture he was to learn all. Damnation, he\\nreflected, is but a word bandied about by those whose blindness leads\\nthem to condemn all who can see, even with a single eye. He wondered at\\nthe vast conceit of those who had babbled of the malignant Ancient\\nOnes, as if They could pause from their everlasting dreams to wreak a\\nwrath on mankind. As well, he thought, might a mammoth pause to visit\\nfrantic vengeance on an angleworm. Now the whole assemblage on the\\nvaguely hexagonal pillars was greeting him with a gesture of those\\noddly carven scepters and radiating a message which he understood:\\n\\n\"We salute you, Most Ancient One, and you, Randolph Carter, whose\\ndaring has made you one of us.\"\\n\\nCarter saw now that one of the pedestals was vacant, and a gesture\\nof the Most Ancient One told him it was reserved for him. He saw\\nalso another pedestal, taller than the rest, and at the center of\\nthe oddly curved lineâ\\x80\\x94neither semicircle nor ellipse, parabola nor\\nhyperbolaâ\\x80\\x94which they formed. This, he guessed, was the Guide\\'s own\\nthrone. Moving and rising in a manner hardly definable, Carter took his\\nseat; and as he did so he saw that the Guide had seated himself.\\n\\nGradually and mistily it became apparent that the Most Ancient One\\nwas holding somethingâ\\x80\\x94some object clutched in the outflung folds of\\nhis robe as if for the sight, or what answered for sight, of the\\ncloaked Companions. It was a large sphere, or apparent sphere, of\\nsome obscurely iridescent metal, and as the Guide put it forward a\\nlow, pervasive half-impression of sound began to rise and fall in\\nintervals which seemed to be rhythmic even though they followed no\\nrhythm of Earth. There was a suggestion of chantingâ\\x80\\x94or what human\\nimagination might interpret as chanting. Presently the quasi-sphere\\nbegan to grow luminous, and as it gleamed up into a cold, pulsating\\nlight of unassignable color, Carter saw that its flickerings conformed\\nto the alien rhythm of the chant. Then all the mitered, scepter-bearing\\nShapes on the pedestals commenced a slight, curious swaying in the same\\ninexplicable rhythm, while nimbuses of unclassifiable lightâ\\x80\\x94resembling\\nthat of the quasi-sphereâ\\x80\\x94played around their shrouded heads.\\n\\nThe Hindoo paused in his tale and looked curiously at the tall,\\ncoffin-shaped clock with the four hands and hieroglyphed dial, whose\\ncrazy ticking followed no known rhythm of Earth.\\n\\n\"You, Mr. de Marigny,\" he suddenly said to his learned host, \"do not\\nneed to be told the particularly alien rhythm to which those cowled\\nShapes on the hexagonal pillars chanted and nodded. You are the only\\none elseâ\\x80\\x94in Americaâ\\x80\\x94who has had a taste of the Outer Extension. That\\nclockâ\\x80\\x94I suppose it was sent you by the Yogi poor Harley Warren used\\nto talk aboutâ\\x80\\x94the seer who said that he alone of living men had been\\nto Yian-Ho, the hidden legacy of eon-old Leng, and had borne certain\\nthings away from that dreadful and forbidden city. I wonder how many of\\nits subtler properties you know? If my dreams and readings be correct,\\nit was made by those who knew much of the First Gateway. But let me go\\non with my tale.\"\\n\\nAt last, continued the Swami, the swaying and the suggestion of\\nchanting ceased, the lambent nimbuses around the now drooping and\\nmotionless heads faded, while the cloaked shapes slumped curiously on\\ntheir pedestals. The quasi-sphere, however, continued to pulsate with\\ninexplicable light. Carter felt that the Ancient Ones were sleeping\\nas they had been when he first saw them, and he wondered out of what\\ncosmic dreams his coming had aroused them. Slowly there filtered into\\nhis mind the truth that this strange chanting ritual had been one of\\ninstruction, and that the Companions had been chanted by the Most\\nAncient One into a new and peculiar kind of sleep in order that their\\ndreams might open the Ultimate Gate to which the silver key was a\\npassport. He knew that in the profundity of this deep sleep they were\\ncontemplating unplumbed vastnesses of utter and absolute outsideness,\\nand that they were to accomplish that which his presence had demanded.\\n\\nThe Guide did not share this sleep, but seemed still to be giving\\ninstructions in some subtle, soundless way. Evidently he was implanting\\nimages of those things which he wished the Companions to dream: and\\nCarter knew that as each of the Ancient Ones pictured the prescribed\\nthought, there would be born the nucleus of a manifestation visible\\nto his earthly eyes. When the dreams of all the Shapes had achieved a\\noneness, that manifestation would occur, and everything he required\\nbe materialized, through concentration. He had seen such things on\\nEarthâ\\x80\\x94in India, where the combined, projected will of a circle of\\nadepts can make a thought take tangible substance, and in hoary\\nAtlaanÃ¢t, of which few even dare speak.\\n\\nJust what the Ultimate Gate was, and how it was to be passed, Carter\\ncould not be certain; but a feeling of tense expectancy surged over\\nhim. He was conscious of having a kind of body, and of holding the\\nfateful silver key in his hand. The masses of towering stone opposite\\nhim seemed to possess the evenness of a wall, toward the center of\\nwhich his eyes were irresistibly drawn. And then suddenly he felt the\\nmental currents of the Most Ancient One cease to flow forth.\\n\\nFor the first time Carter realized how terrific utter silence, mental\\nand physical, may be. The earlier moments had never failed to contain\\nsome perceptible rhythm, if only the faint, cryptical pulse of the\\nEarth\\'s dimensional extension, but now the hush of the abyss seemed\\nto fall upon everything. Despite his intimations of body, he had no\\naudible breath; and the glow of \\'Umr at-Tawil\\'s quasi-sphere had grown\\npetrifiedly fixed and unpulsating. A potent nimbus, brighter than those\\nwhich had played round the heads of the Shapes, blazed frozenly over\\nthe shrouded skull of the terrible Guide.\\n\\nA dizziness assailed Carter, and his sense of lost orientation waxed\\na thousandfold. The strange lights seemed to hold the quality of the\\nmost impenetrable blacknesses heaped upon blacknesses, while about\\nthe Ancient Ones, so close on their pseudo-hexagonal thrones, there\\nhovered an air of the most stupefying remoteness. Then he felt himself\\nwafted into immeasurable depths, with waves of perfumed warmth lapping\\nagainst his face. It was as if he floated in a torrid, rose-tinctured\\nsea; a sea of drugged wine whose waves broke foaming against shores of\\nbrazen fire. A great fear clutched him as he half saw that vast expanse\\nof surging sea lapping against its far-off coast. But the moment of\\nsilence was brokenâ\\x80\\x94the surgings were speaking to him in a language\\nthat was not of physical sound or articulate words.\\n\\n\" The Man of Truth is beyond good and evil ,\" intoned a voice that was\\nnot a voice. \" The Man of Truth has ridden to All-Is-One. The Man of\\nTruth has learned that Illusion is the One Reality, and that Substance\\nis the Great Impostor. \"\\n\\nAnd now, in that rise of masonry to which his eyes had been so\\nirresistibly drawn, there appeared the outline of a titanic arch not\\nunlike that which he thought he had glimpsed so long ago in that cave\\nwithin a cave, on the far, unreal surface of the three-dimensioned\\nEarth. He realized that he had been using the silver keyâ\\x80\\x94moving it in\\naccord with an unlearned and instinctive ritual closely akin to that\\nwhich had opened the Inner Gate. That rose-drunken sea which lapped\\nhis cheeks was, he realized, no more or less than the adamantine mass\\nof the solid wall yielding before his spell, and the vortex of thought\\nwith which the Ancient Ones had aided his spell. Still guided by\\ninstinct and blind determination, he floated forwardâ\\x80\\x94and through the\\nUltimate Gate.\\n\\nCHAPTER 4\\n\\nRandolph Carter\\'s advance through that cyclopean bulk of masonry was\\nlike a dizzy precipitation through the measureless gulfs between the\\nstars. From a great distance he felt triumphant, god-like surges of\\ndeadly sweetness, and after that the rustling of great wings, and\\nimpressions of sound like the chirpings and murmurings of objects\\nunknown on Earth or in the solar system. Glancing backward, he saw not\\none gate alone, but a multiplicity of gates, at some of which clamored\\nForms he strove not to remember.\\n\\nAnd then, suddenly, he felt a greater terror than that which any of the\\nForms could giveâ\\x80\\x94a terror from which he could not flee because it was\\nconnected with himself. Even the First Gateway had taken something of\\nstability from him, leaving him uncertain about his bodily form and\\nabout his relationship to the mistily defined objects around him, but\\nit had not disturbed his sense of unity. He had still been Randolph\\nCarter, a fixed point in the dimensional seething. Now, beyond the\\nUltimate Gateway, he realized in a moment of consuming fright that he\\nwas not one person, but many persons.\\n\\nHe was in many places at the same time. On Earth, on October 7, 1883,\\na little boy named Randolph Carter was leaving the Snake Den in the\\nhushed evening light and running down the rocky slope, and through\\nthe twisted-boughed orchard toward his Uncle Christopher\\'s house in\\nthe hills beyond Arkham; yet at that same moment, which was also\\nsomehow in the earthly year of 1928, a vague shadow not less Randolph\\nCarter was sitting on a pedestal among the Ancient Ones in Earth\\'s\\ntransdimensional extension. Here, too, was a third Randolph Carter,\\nin the unknown and formless cosmic abyss beyond the Ultimate Gate.\\nAnd elsewhere, in a chaos of scenes whose infinite multiplicity and\\nmonstrous diversity brought him close to the brink of madness, were a\\nlimitless confusion of beings which he knew were as much himself as the\\nlocal manifestation now beyond the Ultimate Gate.\\n\\nThere were Carters in settings belonging to every known and suspected\\nage of Earth\\'s history, and to remoter ages of earthly entity\\ntranscending knowledge, suspicion, and credibility; Carters of forms\\nboth human and non-human, vertebrate and invertebrate, conscious and\\nmindless, animal and vegetable. And more, there were Carters having\\nnothing in common with earthly life, but moving outrageously amidst\\nbackgrounds of other planets and systems and galaxies and cosmic\\ncontinua; spores of eternal life drifting from world to world, universe\\nto universe, yet all equally himself. Some of the glimpses recalled\\ndreamsâ\\x80\\x94both faint and vivid, single and persistentâ\\x80\\x94which he had\\nhad through the long years since he first began to dream; and a few\\npossessed a haunting, fascinating and almost horrible familiarity which\\nno earthly logic could explain.\\n\\nFaced with this realization, Randolph Carter reeled in the clutch\\nof supreme horrorâ\\x80\\x94horror such as had not been hinted even at the\\nclimax of that hideous night when two had ventured into an ancient\\nand abhorred necropolis under a waning moon and only one had emerged.\\nNo death, no doom, no anguish can arouse the surpassing despair which\\nflows from a loss of identity . Merging with nothingness is peaceful\\noblivion; but to be aware of existence and yet to know that one is no\\nlonger a definite being distinguished from other beingsâ\\x80\\x94that one no\\nlonger has a self â\\x80\\x94that is the nameless summit of agony and dread.\\n\\nHe knew that there had been a Randolph Carter of Boston, yet could\\nnot be sure whether heâ\\x80\\x94the fragment or facet of an entity beyond the\\nUltimate Gateâ\\x80\\x94had been that one or some other. His self had been\\nannihilated; and yet heâ\\x80\\x94if indeed there could, in view of that utter\\nnullity of individual existence, be such a thing as he â\\x80\\x94was equally\\naware of being in some inconceivable way a legion of selves. It was\\nas though his body had been suddenly transformed into one of those\\nmany-limbed and many-headed effigies sculptured in Indian temples, and\\nhe contemplated the aggregation in a bewildered attempt to discern\\nwhich was the original and which the additionsâ\\x80\\x94if indeed (supremely\\nmonstrous thought!) there were any original as distinguished from\\nother embodiments.\\n\\nThen, in the midst of these devastating reflections, Carter\\'s\\nbeyond-the-gate fragment was hurled from what had seemed the nadir of\\nhorror to black, clutching pits of a horror still more profound. This\\ntime it was largely externalâ\\x80\\x94a force or personality which at once\\nconfronted and surrounded and pervaded him, and which in addition to\\nits local presence, seemed also to be a part of himself, and likewise\\nto be co-existent with all time and conterminous with all space. There\\nwas no visual image, yet the sense of entity and the awful concept of\\ncombined localism and identity and infinity lent a paralyzing terror\\nbeyond anything which any Carter-fragment had hitherto deemed capable\\nof existing.\\n\\nIn the face of that awful wonder, the quasi-Carter forgot the horror\\nof destroyed individuality. It was an All-in-One and One-in-All\\nof limitless being and selfâ\\x80\\x94not merely a thing of one space-time\\ncontinuum, but allied to the ultimate animating essence of existence\\'s\\nwhole unbounded sweepâ\\x80\\x94the last, utter sweep which has no confines and\\nwhich outreaches fancy and mathematics alike. It was perhaps that which\\ncertain secret cults of Earth had whispered of as Yog-Sothoth , and\\nwhich has been a deity under other names; that which the crustaceans\\nof Yuggoth worship as the Beyond-One, and which the vaporous brains of\\nthe spiral nebulÃ¦ know by an untranslatable signâ\\x80\\x94yet in a flash the\\nCarter-facet realized how slight and fractional all these conceptions\\nare.\\n\\nAnd now the Being was addressing the Carter-facet in prodigious waves\\nthat smote and burned and thunderedâ\\x80\\x94a concentration of energy that\\nblasted its recipient with well-nigh unendurable violence, and that\\nparalleled in an unearthly rhythm the curious swaying of the Ancient\\nOnes, and the flickering of the monstrous lights, in that baffling\\nregion beyond the First Gate. It was as though suns and worlds and\\nuniverses had converged upon one point whose very position in space\\nthey had conspired to annihilate with an impact of resistless fury. But\\namidst the greater terror one lesser terror was diminished; for the\\nsearing waves appeared somehow to isolate the Beyond-the-Gate Carter\\nfrom his infinity of duplicatesâ\\x80\\x94to restore, as it were, a certain\\namount of the illusion of identity. After a time the hearer began to\\ntranslate the waves into speech-forms known to him, and his sense of\\nhorror and oppression waned. Fright became pure awe, and what had\\nseemed blasphemously abnormal seemed now only ineffably majestic.\\n\\n\"Randolph Carter,\" it seemed to say, \"my manifestations on your\\nplanet\\'s extension, the Ancient Ones, have sent you as one who would\\nlately have returned to small lands of dream which he had lost, yet\\nwho with greater freedom has risen to greater and nobler desires and\\ncuriosities. You wished to sail up golden Oukranos, to search out\\nforgotten ivory cities in orchid-heavy Kled, and to reign on the opal\\nthrone of Ilek-Vad, whose fabulous towers and numberless domes rise\\nmighty toward a single red star in a filament alien to your Earth and\\nto all matter. Now, with the passing of two Gates, you wish loftier\\nthings. You would not flee like a child from a scene disliked to a\\ndream beloved, but would plunge like a man into that last and inmost of\\nsecrets which lies behind all scenes and dreams.\\n\\n\"What you wish, I have found good; and I am ready to grant that which\\nI have granted eleven times only to beings of your planetâ\\x80\\x94five times\\nonly to those you call men, or those resembling them. I am ready to\\nshow you the Ultimate Mystery, to look on which is to blast a feeble\\nspirit. Yet before you gaze full at that last and first of secrets you\\nmay still wield a free choice, and return if you will through the two\\nGates with the Veil still unrent before your eyes.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER 5\\n\\nA sudden shutting-off of the waves left Carter in a chilling and\\nawesome silence full of the spirit of desolation. On every hand pressed\\nthe illimitable vastness of the void; yet the seeker knew that the\\nBeing was still there. After a moment he thought of words whose mental\\nsubstance he flung into the abyss: \"I accept. I will not retreat.\"\\n\\nThe waves surged forth again, and Carter knew that the Being had heard.\\nAnd now there poured from that limitless Mind a flood of knowledge and\\nexplanation which opened new vistas to the seeker, and prepared him\\nfor such a grasp of the cosmos as he had never hoped to possess. He\\nwas told how childish and limited is the notion of a tri-dimensional\\nworld, and what an infinity of directions there are besides the known\\ndirections of up-down, forward-backward, right-left. He was shown the\\nsmallness and tinsel emptiness of the little Earth gods, with their\\npetty, human interests and connectionsâ\\x80\\x94their hatreds, rages, loves and\\nvanities; their craving for praise and sacrifice, and their demands for\\nfaiths contrary to reason and nature.\\n\\nWhile most of the impressions translated themselves to Carter as words,\\nthere were others to which other senses gave interpretation. Perhaps\\nwith eyes and perhaps with imagination he perceived that he was in a\\nregion of dimensions beyond those conceivable to the eye and brain of\\nman. He saw now, in the brooding shadows of that which had been first\\na vortex of power and then an illimitable void, a sweep of creation\\nthat dizzied his senses. From some inconceivable vantage-point he\\nlooked upon prodigious forms whose multiple extensions transcended any\\nconception of being, size and boundaries which his mind had hitherto\\nbeen able to hold, despite a lifetime of cryptical study. He began to\\nunderstand dimly why there could exist at the same time the little boy\\nRandolph Carter in the Arkham farmhouse in 1883, the misty form on the\\nvaguely hexagonal pillar beyond the First Gate, the fragment now facing\\nthe Presence in the limitless abyss, and all the other Carters his\\nfancy or perception envisaged.\\n\\nThen the waves increased in strength and sought to improve his\\nunderstanding, reconciling him to the multiform entity of which his\\npresent fragment was an infinitesimal part. They told him that every\\nfigure of space is but the result of the intersection by a plane of\\nsome corresponding figure of one more dimensionâ\\x80\\x94as a square is cut\\nfrom a cube, or a circle from a sphere. The cube and sphere, of three\\ndimensions, are thus cut from corresponding forms of four dimensions,\\nwhich men know only through guesses and dreams; and these in turn\\nare cut from forms of five dimensions, and so on up to the dizzy and\\nreachless heights of archetypal infinity. The world of men and of\\nthe gods of men is merely an infinitesimal phase of an infinitesimal\\nthingâ\\x80\\x94the three-dimensional phase of that small wholeness reached\\nby the First Gate, where Umr at-Tawil dictates dreams to the\\nAncient Ones. Though men hail it as reality, and brand thoughts of\\nits many-dimensioned original as unreality, it is in truth the very\\nopposite. That which we call substance and reality is shadow and\\nillusion, and that which we call shadow and illusion is substance and\\nreality.\\n\\nTime, the waves went on, is motionless, and without beginning or end.\\nThat it has motion and is the cause of change is an illusion. Indeed,\\nit is itself really an illusion, for except to the narrow sight of\\nbeings in limited dimensions there are no such things as past, present\\nand future. Men think of time only because of what they call change,\\nyet that too is illusion. All that was, and is, and is to be, exists\\nsimultaneously.\\n\\nThese revelations came with a god-like solemnity which left Carter\\nunable to doubt. Even though they lay almost beyond his comprehension,\\nhe felt that they must be true in the light of that final cosmic\\nreality which belies all local perspectives and narrow partial views;\\nand he was familiar enough with profound speculations to be free from\\nthe bondage of local and partial conceptions. Had his whole quest not\\nbeen based upon a faith in the unreality of the local and partial?\\n\\nAfter an impressive pause the waves continued, saying that what the\\ndenizens of few-dimensioned zones call change is merely a function\\nof their consciousness, which views the external world from various\\ncosmic angles. As the Shapes produced by the cutting of a cone seem to\\nvary with the angles of cuttingâ\\x80\\x94being circle, ellipse, parabola or\\nhyperbola according to that angle, yet without any change in the cone\\nitselfâ\\x80\\x94so do the local aspects of an unchanged and endless reality\\nseem to change with the cosmic angle of regarding. To this variety\\nof angles of consciousness the feeble beings of the inner worlds are\\nslaves, since with rare exceptions they can not learn to control them.\\nOnly a few students of forbidden things have gained inklings of this\\ncontrol, and have thereby conquered time and change. But the entities\\noutside the Gates command all angles, and view the myriad parts of the\\ncosmos in terms of fragmentary change-involving perspective, or of the\\nchangeless totality beyond perspective, in accordance with their will.\\n\\nAs the waves paused again, Carter began to comprehend, vaguely\\nand terrifiedly, the ultimate background of that riddle of lost\\nindividuality which had at first so horrified him. His intuition pieced\\ntogether the fragments of revelation, and brought him closer and closer\\nto a grasp of the secret. He understood that much of the frightful\\nrevelation would have come upon himâ\\x80\\x94splitting up his ego amongst\\nmyriads of earthly counterpartsâ\\x80\\x94inside the First Gate, had not the\\nmagic of \\'Umr at-Tawil kept it from him in order that he might use the\\nsilver key with precision for the Ultimate Gate\\'s opening. Anxious for\\nclearer knowledge, he sent out waves of thought, asking more of the\\nexact relationship between his various facetsâ\\x80\\x94the fragment now beyond\\nthe Ultimate Gate, the fragment still on the quasi-hexagonal pedestal\\nbeyond the First Gate, the boy of 1883, the man of 1928, the various\\nancestral beings who had formed his heritage and the bulwark of his\\nego, and the nameless denizens of the other eons and other worlds which\\nthat first hideous flash of ultimate perception had identified with\\nhim. Slowly the waves of the Being surged out in reply, trying to make\\nplain what was almost beyond the reach of an earthly mind.\\n\\nAll descended lines of beings of the finite dimensions, continued\\nthe waves, and all stages of growth in each one of these beings, are\\nmerely manifestations of one archetypal and eternal being in the space\\noutside dimensions. Each local beingâ\\x80\\x94son, father, grandfather, and so\\nonâ\\x80\\x94and each stage of individual beingâ\\x80\\x94infant, child, boy, manâ\\x80\\x94is\\nmerely one of the infinite phases of that same archetypal and eternal\\nbeing, caused by a variation in the angle of the consciousness-plane\\nwhich cuts it. Randolph Carter at all ages; Randolph Carter and all his\\nancestors, both human and pre-human, terrestrial and pre-terrestrial;\\nall these were only phases of one ultimate, eternal \"Carter\" outside\\nspace and timeâ\\x80\\x94phantom projections differentiated only by the angle at\\nwhich the plane of consciousness happened to cut the eternal archetype\\nin each case.\\n\\nA slight change of angle could turn the student of today into the\\nchild of yesterday; could turn Randolph Carter into that wizard,\\nEdmund Carter who fled from Salem to the hills behind Arkham in 1692,\\nor that Pickman Carter who in the year 2169 would use strange means\\nin repelling the Mongol hordes from Australia; could turn a human\\nCarter into one of those earlier entities which had dwelt in primal\\nHyperborea and worshipped black, plastic Tsathoggua after flying down\\nfrom Kythamil, the double planet that once revolved around Arcturus;\\ncould turn a terrestrial Carter to a remotely ancestral and doubtfully\\nshaped dweller on Kythamil itself, or a still remoter creature of\\ntrans-galactic Stronti, or a four-dimensioned gaseous consciousness in\\nan older space-time continuum, or a vegetable brain of the future on a\\ndark, radio-active comet of inconceivable orbitâ\\x80\\x94and so on, in endless\\ncosmic cycle.\\n\\nThe archetypes, throbbed the waves, are the people of the Ultimate\\nAbyssâ\\x80\\x94formless, ineffable, and guessed at only by rare dreamers on\\nthe low-dimensioned worlds. Chief among such was this informing Being\\nitself ... which indeed was Carter\\'s own archetype . The glutless zeal\\nof Carter and all his forebears for forbidden cosmic secrets was a\\nnatural result of derivation from the Supreme Archetype. On every world\\nall great wizards, all great thinkers, all great artists, are facets of\\nIt.\\n\\nAlmost stunned with awe, and with a kind of terrifying delight,\\nRandolph Carter\\'s consciousness did homage to that transcendent Entity\\nfrom which it was derived. As the waves paused again he pondered in the\\nmighty silence, thinking of strange tributes, stranger questions, and\\nstill stranger requests. Curious concepts flowed conflictingly through\\na brain dazed with unaccustomed vistas and unforeseen disclosures.\\nIt occurred to him that, if these disclosures were literally true,\\nhe might bodily visit all those infinitely distant ages and parts of\\nthe universe which he had hitherto known only in dreams, could he but\\ncommand the magic to change the angle of his consciousness-plane. And\\ndid not the silver key supply that magic? Had it not first changed\\nhim from a man in 1928 to a boy in 1883, and then to something quite\\noutside time? Oddly, despite his present apparent absence of body, he\\nknew that the key was still with him.\\n\\nWhile the silence still lasted, Randolph Carter radiated forth\\nthe thoughts and questions which assailed him. He knew that in\\nthis ultimate abyss he was equidistant from every facet of his\\narchetypeâ\\x80\\x94human or non-human, terrestrial or extra-terrestrial,\\ngalactic or trans-galactic; and his curiosity regarding the other\\nphases of his beingâ\\x80\\x94especially those phases which were farthest from\\nan earthly 1928 in time and space, or which had most persistently\\nhaunted his dreams throughout lifeâ\\x80\\x94was at fever heat. He felt that his\\narchetypal Entity could at will send him bodily to any of these phases\\nof bygone and distant life by changing his consciousness-plane, and\\ndespite the marvels he had undergone he burned for the further marvel\\nof walking in the flesh through those grotesque and incredible scenes\\nwhich visions of the night had fragmentarily brought him.\\n\\nWithout definite intention he was asking the Presence for access\\nto a dim, fantastic world whose five multicolored suns, alien\\nconstellations, dizzily black crags, clawed, tapir-snouted denizens,\\nbizarre metal towers, unexplained tunnels, and cryptical floating\\ncylinders had intruded again and again upon his slumbers. That world,\\nhe felt vaguely, was in all the conceivable cosmos the one most freely\\nin touch with others; and he longed to explore the vistas whose\\nbeginnings he had glimpsed, and to embark through space to those still\\nremoter worlds with which the clawed, snouted denizens trafficked.\\nThere was no time for fear. As at all crises of his strange life, sheer\\ncosmic curiosity triumphed over everything else.\\n\\nWhen the waves resumed their awesome pulsing, Carter knew that his\\nterrible request was granted. The Being was telling him of the nighted\\ngulfs through which he would have to pass, of the unknown quintuple\\nstar in an unsuspected galaxy around which the alien world revolved,\\nand of the burrowing inner horrors against which the clawed, snouted\\nrace of that world perpetually fought. It told him, too, of how the\\nangle of his personal consciousness-plane, and the angle of his\\nconsciousness-plane regarding the space-time elements of the sought-for\\nworld, would have to be tilted simultaneously in order to restore to\\nthat world the Carter-facet which had dwelt there.\\n\\nThe Presence warned him to be sure of his symbols if he wished ever to\\nreturn from the remote and alien world he had chosen, and he radiated\\nback an impatient affirmation; confident that the silver key, which he\\nfelt was with him and which he knew had tilted both world and personal\\nplanes in throwing him back to 1883, contained those symbols which\\nwere meant. And now the Being, grasping his impatience, signified its\\nreadiness to accomplish the monstrous precipitation. The waves abruptly\\nceased, and there supervened a momentary stillness tense with nameless\\nand dreadful expectancy.\\n\\nThen, without warning, came a whirring and drumming that swelled to a\\nterrific thundering. Once again Carter felt himself the focal point of\\nan intense concentration of energy which smote and hammered and seared\\nunbearably in the now-familiar rhythm of outer space, and which he\\ncould not classify as either the blasting heat of a blazing star, or\\nthe all-petrifying cold of the ultimate abyss. Bands and rays of color\\nutterly foreign to any spectrum of our universe played and wove and\\ninterlaced before him, and he was conscious of a frightful velocity of\\nmotion. He caught one fleeting glimpse of a figure sitting alone upon\\na cloudy throne more hexagonal than otherwise....\\n\\nCHAPTER 6\\n\\nAs the Hindoo paused in his story he saw that de Marigny and Phillips\\nwere watching him absorbedly. Aspinwall pretended to ignore the\\nnarrative and kept his eyes ostentatiously on the papers before him.\\nThe alien-rhythmed ticking of the coffin-shaped clock took on a new and\\nportentous meaning, while the fumes from the choked, neglected tripods\\nwove themselves into fantastic and inexplicable shapes, and formed\\ndisturbing combinations with the grotesque figures of the draft-swayed\\ntapestries. The old negro who had tended them was goneâ\\x80\\x94perhaps\\nsome growing tension had frightened him out of the house. An almost\\napologetic hesitancy hampered the speaker as he resumed in his oddly\\nlabored yet idiomatic voice.\\n\\n\"You have found these things of the abyss hard to believe,\" he said,\\n\"but you will find the tangible and material things ahead still\\nharder. That is the way of our minds. Marvels are doubly incredible\\nwhen brought into three dimensions from the vague regions of possible\\ndream. I shall not try to tell you muchâ\\x80\\x94that would be another and very\\ndifferent story. I will tell only what you absolutely have to know.\"\\n\\nCarter, after that final vortex of alien and polychromatic rhythm,\\nhad found himself in what for a moment he thought was his old\\ninsistent dream. He was, as many a night before, walking amidst\\nthrongs of clawed, snouted beings through the streets of a labyrinth\\nof inexplicably fashioned metal under a blaze of diverse solar color;\\nand as he looked down he saw that his body was like those of the\\nothersâ\\x80\\x94rugose, partly squamous, and curiously articulated in a fashion\\nmainly insect-like yet not without a caricaturish resemblance to the\\nhuman outline. The silver key was still in his grasp, though held by a\\nnoxious-looking claw.\\n\\nIn another moment the dream-sense vanished, and he felt rather as\\none just awakened from a dream. The ultimate abyssâ\\x80\\x94the Beingâ\\x80\\x94the\\nentity of absurd, outlandish race called Randolph Carter on a world\\nof the future not yet bornâ\\x80\\x94some of these things were parts of the\\npersistent recurrent dreams of the wizard Zkauba on the planet Yaddith.\\nThey were too persistentâ\\x80\\x94they interfered with his duties in weaving\\nspells to keep the frightful Dholes in their burrows, and became mixed\\nup with his recollections of the myriad real worlds he had visited\\nin light-beam envelopes. And now they had become quasi-real as never\\nbefore. This heavy, material silver key in his right upper claw, exact\\nimage of one he had dreamt about, meant no good. He must rest and\\nreflect, and consult the tablets of Nhing for advice on what to do.\\nClimbing a metal wall in a lane off the main concourse, he entered his\\napartment and approached the rack of tablets.\\n\\nSeven day-fractions later Zkauba squatted on his prism in awe and half\\ndespair, for the truth had opened up a new and conflicting set of\\nmemories. Nevermore could he know the peace of being one entity. For\\nall time and space he was two: Zkauba the wizard of Yaddith, disgusted\\nwith the thought of the repellent earth-mammal Carter that he was to be\\nand had been, and Randolph Carter, of Boston on the Earth, shivering\\nwith fright at the clawed, snouted thing which he had once been, and\\nhad become again.\\n\\nThe time units spent on Yaddith, croaked the Swamiâ\\x80\\x94whose labored voice\\nwas beginning to show signs of fatigueâ\\x80\\x94made a tale in themselves\\nwhich could not be related in brief compass. There were trips to\\nStronti and Mthura and Kath, and other worlds in the twenty-eight\\ngalaxies accessible to the light-beam envelopes of the creatures of\\nYaddith, and trips back and forth through eons of time with the aid of\\nthe silver key and various other symbols known to Yaddith\\'s wizards.\\nThere were hideous struggles with the bleached viscous Dholes in the\\nprimal tunnels that honeycombed the planet. There were awed sessions\\nin libraries amongst the massed lore of ten thousand worlds living\\nand dead. There were tense conferences with other minds of Yaddith,\\nincluding that of the Arch-Ancient Buo. Zkauba told no one of what\\nhad befallen his personality, but when the Randolph Carter facet was\\nuppermost he would study furiously every possible means of returning\\nto the Earth and to human form, and would desperately practise human\\nspeech with the alien throat-organs so ill adapted to it.\\n\\nThe Carter-facet had soon learned with horror that the silver key\\nwas unable to effect his return to human form. It was, as he deduced\\ntoo late from things he remembered, things he dreamed, and things he\\ninferred from the lore of Yaddith, a product of Hyperborea on Earth;\\nwith power over the personal consciousness-angles of human beings\\nalone. It could, however, change the planetary angle and send the user\\nat will through time in an unchanged body. There had been an added\\nspell which gave it limitless powers it otherwise lacked; but this,\\ntoo, was a human discoveryâ\\x80\\x94peculiar to a spatially unreachable region,\\nand not to be duplicated by the wizards of Yaddith. It had been written\\non the undecipherable parchment in the hideously carven box with the\\nsilver key, and Carter bitterly lamented that he had left it behind.\\nThe now inaccessible Being of the abyss had warmed him to be sure of\\nhis symbols, and had doubtless thought he lacked nothing.\\n\\nAs time wore on he strove harder and harder to utilize the monstrous\\nlore of Yaddith in finding a way back to the abyss and the omnipotent\\nEntity. With his new knowledge he could have done much toward reading\\nthe cryptic parchment; but that power, under present conditions, was\\nmerely ironic. There were times, however, when the Zkauba-facet was\\nuppermost, and when he strove to erase the conflicting Carter-memories\\nwhich troubled him.\\n\\nThus long spaces of time wore onâ\\x80\\x94ages longer than the brain of man\\ncould grasp, since the beings of Yaddith die only after prolonged\\ncycles. After many hundreds of revolutions the Carter-facet seemed to\\ngain on the Zkauba-facet, and would spend vast periods calculating\\nthe distance of Yaddith in space and time from the human Earth that\\nwas to be. The figures were staggeringâ\\x80\\x94eons of light-years beyond\\ncountingâ\\x80\\x94but the immemorial lore of Yaddith fitted Carter to grasp\\nsuch things. He cultivated the power of dreaming himself momentarily\\nEarthward, and learned many things about our planet that he had never\\nknown before. But he could not dream the needed formula on the missing\\nparchment.\\n\\nThen at last he conceived a wild plan of escape from Yaddithâ\\x80\\x94which\\nbegan when he found a drug that would keep his Zkauba-facet always\\ndormant, yet without dissolution of the knowledge and memories of\\nZkauba. He thought that his calculations would let him perform a\\nvoyage with a light-wave envelope such as no being of Yaddith had\\never performedâ\\x80\\x94a bodily voyage through nameless eons and across\\nincredible galactic reaches to the solar system and the Earth itself.\\nOnce on Earth, though in the body of a clawed, snouted thing, he\\nmight be able somehow to findâ\\x80\\x94and finish decipheringâ\\x80\\x94the strangely\\nhieroglyphed parchment he had left in the car at Arkham; and with its\\naidâ\\x80\\x94and the key\\'sâ\\x80\\x94resume his normal terrestrial semblance.\\n\\nHe was not blind to the perils of the attempt. He knew that when he\\nhad brought the planet-angle to the right eon (a thing impossible\\nto do while hurtling through space), Yaddith would be a dead world\\ndominated by triumphant Dholes, and that his escape in the light-wave\\nenvelope would be a matter of grave doubt. Likewise was he aware of\\nhow he must achieve suspended animation, in the manner of an adept, to\\nendure the eon-long flight through fathomless abysses. He knew, too,\\nthatâ\\x80\\x94assuming his voyage succeededâ\\x80\\x94he must immunize himself to the\\nbacterial and other earthly conditions hostile to a body from Yaddith.\\nFurthermore, he must provide a way of feigning human shape on Earth\\nuntil he might recover and decipher the parchment and resume that shape\\nin truth. Otherwise he would probably be discovered and destroyed by\\nthe people in horror as a thing that should not be. And there must be\\nsome goldâ\\x80\\x94luckily obtainable on Yaddithâ\\x80\\x94to tide him over that period\\nof quest.\\n\\nSlowly Carter\\'s plans went forward. He provided a light-wave\\nenvelope of abnormal toughness, able to stand both the prodigious\\ntime-transition and the unexampled flight through space. He tested all\\nhis calculations, and sent forth his Earthward dreams again and again,\\nbringing them as close as possible to 1928. He practised suspended\\nanimation with marvelous success. He discovered just the bacterial\\nagent he needed, and worked out the varying gravity-stress to which\\nhe must become used. He artfully fashioned a waxen mask and loose\\ncostume enabling him to pass among men as a human being of a sort,\\nand devised a doubly potent spell with which to hold back the Dholes\\nat the moment of his starting from the dead, black Yaddith of the\\ninconceivable future. He took care, too, to assemble a large supply of\\nthe drugsâ\\x80\\x94unobtainable on Earthâ\\x80\\x94which would keep his Zkauba-facet\\nin abeyance till he might shed the Yaddith body, nor did he neglect a\\nsmall store of gold for earthly use.\\n\\nThe starting-day was a time of doubt and apprehension. Carter climbed\\nup to his envelope-platform, on the pretext of sailing for the triple\\nstar Nython, and crawled into the sheath of shining metal. He had just\\nroom to perform the ritual of the silver key, and as he did so he\\nslowly started the levitation of his envelope. There was an appalling\\nseething and darkening of the day, and a hideous racking of pain. The\\ncosmos seemed to reel irresponsibly, and the other constellations\\ndanced in a black sky.\\n\\n\"Below him the ground was festering with gigantic Dholes.\"\\n\\nAll at once Carter felt a new equilibrium. The cold of interstellar\\ngulfs gnawed at the outside of his envelope, and he could see that he\\nfloated free in spaceâ\\x80\\x94the metal building from which he had started\\nhaving decayed years before. Below him the ground was festering with\\ngigantic Dholes; and even as he looked, one reared up several hundred\\nfeet and levelled a bleached, viscous end at him. But his spells were\\neffective, and in another moment he was falling away from Yaddith,\\nunharmed.\\n\\nCHAPTER 7\\n\\nIn that bizarre room in New Orleans, from which the old black servant\\nhad instinctively fled, the odd voice of Swami Chandraputra grew\\nhoarser still.\\n\\n\"Gentlemen,\" he continued, \"I will not ask you to believe these things\\nuntil I have shown you special proof. Accept it, then, as a myth, when\\nI tell you of the thousands of light-yearsâ\\x80\\x94thousands of years of\\ntime, and uncounted billions of miles that Randolph Carter hurtled\\nthrough space as a nameless, alien entity in a thin envelope of\\nelectron-activated metal. He timed his period of suspended animation\\nwith utmost care, planning to have it end only a few years before the\\ntime of landing on the Earth in or near 1928.\\n\\n\"He will never forget that awakening. Remember, gentlemen, that\\nbefore that eon-long sleep he had lived consciously for thousands of\\nterrestrial years amidst the alien and horrible wonders of Yaddith .\\nThere was a hideous gnawing of cold, a cessation of menacing dreams,\\nand a glance through the eye-plates of the envelope. Stars, clusters,\\nnebulÃ¦, on every handâ\\x80\\x94 and at last their outlines bore some kinship\\nto the constellations of Earth that he knew .\\n\\n\"Some day his descent into the solar system may be told. He saw Kynarth\\nand Yuggoth on the rim, passed close to Neptune and glimpsed the\\nhellish white fungi that spot it, learned an untellable secret from\\nthe close-glimpsed mists of Jupiter, and saw the horror on one of the\\nsatellites, and gazed at the cyclopean ruins that sprawl over Mars\\'\\nruddy disk. When the Earth drew near he saw it as a thin crescent which\\nswelled alarmingly in size. He slackened speed, though his sensations\\nof homecoming made him wish to lose not a moment. I will not try to\\ntell you of those sensations as I learned them from Carter.\\n\\n\"Well, toward the last Carter hovered about in the Earth\\'s upper air\\nwaiting till daylight came over the Western Hemisphere. He wanted to\\nland where he had leftâ\\x80\\x94near the Snake Den in the hills behind Arkham.\\nIf any of you have been away from home longâ\\x80\\x94and I know one of you\\nhasâ\\x80\\x94I leave it to you how the sight of New England\\'s rolling hills\\nand great elms and gnarled orchards and ancient stone walls must have\\naffected him.\\n\\n\"He came down at dawn in the lower meadow of the old Carter place, and\\nwas thankful for the silence and solitude. It was autumn, as when he\\nhad left, and the smell of the hills was balm to his soul. He managed\\nto drag the metal envelope up the slope of the timber-lot into the\\nSnake Den, though it would not go through the weed-choked fissure to\\nthe inner cave. It was there also that he covered his alien body with\\nthe human clothing and waxen mask which would be necessary. He kept the\\nenvelope here for over a year, till certain circumstances made a new\\nhiding-place necessary.\\n\\n\"He walked to Arkhamâ\\x80\\x94incidentally practising the management of his\\nbody in human posture and against terrestrial gravityâ\\x80\\x94and got his gold\\nchanged to money at a bank. He also made some inquiriesâ\\x80\\x94posing as a\\nforeigner ignorant of much Englishâ\\x80\\x94and found that the year was 1930,\\nonly two years after the goal he had aimed at.\\n\\n\"Of course, his position was horrible. Unable to assert his identity,\\nforced to live on guard every moment, with certain difficulties\\nregarding food, and with a need to conserve the alien drug which kept\\nhis Zkauba-facet dormant, he felt that he must act as quickly as\\npossible. Going to Boston and taking a room in the decaying West End,\\nwhere he could live cheaply and inconspicuously, he at once established\\ninquiries concerning Randolph Carter\\'s estate and effects. It was then\\nthat he learned how anxious Mr. Aspinwall, here, was to have the estate\\ndivided, and how valiantly Mr. de Marigny and Mr. Phillips strove to\\nkeep it intact.\"\\n\\nThe Hindoo bowed, though no expression crossed his dark, tranquil, and\\nthickly bearded face.\\n\\n\"Indirectly,\" he continued, \"Carter secured a good copy of the missing\\nparchment and began working on its deciphering. I am glad to say that\\nI was able to help in all thisâ\\x80\\x94for he appealed to me quite early, and\\nthrough me came in touch with other mystics throughout the world. I\\nwent to live with him in Bostonâ\\x80\\x94a wretched place in Chambers Street.\\nAs for the parchmentâ\\x80\\x94I am pleased to help Mr. de Marigny in his\\nperplexity. To him let me say that the language of those hieroglyphics\\nis not Naacal, but R\\'lyehian, which was brought to Earth by the spawn\\nof Cthulhu countless ages ago. It is, of course, a translationâ\\x80\\x94there\\nwas an Hyperborean original millions of years earlier in the primal\\ntongue of Tsath-yo.\\n\\n\"There was more to decipher than Carter had looked for, but at no\\ntime did he give up hope. Early this year he made great strides\\nthrough a book he imported from Nepal, and there is no question but\\nthat he will win before long. Unfortunately, however, one handicap\\nhas developedâ\\x80\\x94the exhaustion of the alien drug which keeps the\\nZkauba-facet dormant. This is not, however, as great a calamity as was\\nfeared. Carter\\'s personality is gaining in the body, and when Zkauba\\ncomes uppermostâ\\x80\\x94for shorter and shorter periods, and now only when\\nevoked by some unusual excitementâ\\x80\\x94he is generally too dazed to undo\\nany of Carter\\'s work. He can not find the metal envelope that would\\ntake him back to Yaddith, for although he almost did, once, Carter hid\\nit anew at a time when the Zkauba-facet was wholly latent. All the harm\\nhe has done is to frighten a few people and create certain nightmare\\nrumors among the Poles and Lithuanians of Boston\\'s West End. So far, he\\nhas never injured the careful disguise prepared by the Carter-facet,\\nthough he sometimes throws it off so that parts have to be replaced. I\\nhave seen what lies beneathâ\\x80\\x94and it is not good to see.\\n\\n\"A month ago Carter saw the advertisement of this meeting, and knew\\nthat he must act quickly to save his estate. He could not wait to\\ndecipher the parchment and resume his human form. Consequently he\\ndeputed me to act for him.\\n\\n\"Gentlemen, I say to you that Randolph Carter is not dead; that he is\\ntemporarily in an anomalous condition, but that within two or three\\nmonths at the outside he will be able to appear in proper form and\\ndemand the custody of his estate. I am prepared to offer proof if\\nnecessary. Therefore I beg that you will adjourn this meeting for an\\nindefinite period.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER 8\\n\\nDe Marigny and Phillips stared at the Hindoo as if hypnotized, while\\nAspinwall emitted a series of snorts and bellows. The old attorney\\'s\\ndisgust had by now surged into open rage, and he pounded the table with\\nan apoplectically veined fist. When he spoke, it was in a kind of bark.\\n\\n\"How long is this foolery to be borne? I\\'ve listened an hour to this\\nmadmanâ\\x80\\x94this fakerâ\\x80\\x94and now he has the damned effrontery to say\\nRandolph Carter is aliveâ\\x80\\x94to ask us to postpone the settlement for no\\ngood reason! Why don\\'t you throw the scoundrel out, de Marigny? Do you\\nmean to make us all the butts of a charlatan or idiot?\"\\n\\nDe Marigny quietly raised his hand and spoke softly.\\n\\n\"Let us think slowly and clearly. This has been a very singular\\ntale, and there are things in it which I, as a mystic not altogether\\nignorant, recognize as far from impossible. Furthermoreâ\\x80\\x94since 1930 I\\nhave received letters from the Swami which tally with his account.\"\\n\\nAs he paused, old Mr. Phillips ventured a word.\\n\\n\"Swami Chandraputra spoke of proofs. I, too, recognize much that\\nis significant in this story, and I have myself had many oddly\\ncorroborative letters from the Swami during the last two years; but\\nsome of these statements are very extreme. Is there not something\\ntangible which can be shown?\"\\n\\nAt last the impassive-faced Swami replied, slowly and hoarsely, and\\ndrawing an object from the pocket of his loose coat as he spoke.\\n\\n\"While none of you here has ever seen the silver key itself, Messrs.\\nde Marigny and Phillips have seen photographs of it. Does this look\\nfamiliar to you? \"\\n\\nHe fumblingly laid on the table, with his large, white-mittened hand,\\na heavy key of tarnished silverâ\\x80\\x94nearly five inches long, of unknown\\nand utterly exotic workmanship, and covered from end to end with\\nhieroglyphs of the most bizarre description. De Marigny and Phillips\\ngasped.\\n\\n\"That\\'s it!\" cried de Marigny. \"The camera doesn\\'t lie. I couldn\\'t be\\nmistaken!\"\\n\\nBut Aspinwall had already launched a reply.\\n\\n\"Fools! What does it prove? If that\\'s really the key that belonged to\\nmy cousin, it\\'s up to this foreignerâ\\x80\\x94this damned niggerâ\\x80\\x94to explain\\nhow he got it! Randolph Carter vanished with the key four years ago.\\nHow do we know he wasn\\'t robbed and murdered? He was half crazy\\nhimself, and in touch with still crazier people.\\n\\n\"Look here, you niggerâ\\x80\\x94where did you get that key? Did you kill\\nRandolph Carter?\"\\n\\nThe Swami\\'s features, abnormally placid, did not change; but the\\nremote, irisless black eyes behind them blazed dangerously. He spoke\\nwith great difficulty.\\n\\n\"Please control yourself, Mr. Aspinwall. There is another form of\\nproof that I could give, but its effect upon everybody would not be\\npleasant. Let us be reasonable. Here are some papers obviously written\\nsince 1930, and in the unmistakable style of Randolph Carter.\"\\n\\nHe clumsily drew a long envelope from inside his loose coat and handed\\nit to the sputtering attorney as de Marigny and Phillips watched with\\nchaotic thoughts and a dawning feeling of supernal wonder.\\n\\n\"Of course the handwriting is almost illegibleâ\\x80\\x94but remember that\\nRandolph Carter now has no hands well adapted to forming human script.\"\\n\\nAspinwall looked through the papers hurriedly, and was visibly\\nperplexed, but he did not change his demeanor. The room was tense\\nwith excitement and nameless dread, and the alien rhythm of the\\ncoffin-shaped clock had an utterly diabolic sound to de Marigny and\\nPhillips, though the lawyer seemed affected not at all.\\n\\nAspinwall spoke again. \"These look like clever forgeries. If they\\naren\\'t, they may mean that Randolph Carter has been brought under the\\ncontrol of people with no good purpose. There\\'s only one thing to\\ndoâ\\x80\\x94have this faker arrested. De Marigny, will you telephone for the\\npolice?\"\\n\\n\"Let us wait,\" answered their host. \"I do not think this case calls for\\nthe police. I have a certain idea. Mr. Aspinwall, this gentleman is a\\nmystic of real attainments. He says he is in the confidence of Randolph\\nCarter. Will it satisfy you if he can answer certain questions which\\ncould be answered only by one in such confidence? I know Carter, and\\ncan ask such questions. Let me get a book which I think will make a\\ngood test.\"\\n\\nHe turned toward the door to the library, Phillips dazedly following\\nin a kind of automatic way. Aspinwall remained where he was, studying\\nclosely the Hindoo who confronted him with abnormally impassive face.\\nSuddenly, as Chandraputra clumsily restored the silver key to his\\npocket, the lawyer emitted a guttural shout.\\n\\n\"Hey, by Heaven! I\\'ve got it! This rascal is in disguise. I don\\'t\\nbelieve he\\'s an East Indian at all. That faceâ\\x80\\x94it isn\\'t a face, but\\na mask ! I guess his story put that into my head, but it\\'s true. It\\nnever moves, and that turban and beard hide the edges. This fellow\\'s\\na common crook! He isn\\'t even a foreignerâ\\x80\\x94I\\'ve been watching his\\nlanguage. He\\'s a Yankee of some sort. And look at those mittensâ\\x80\\x94he\\nknows his fingerprints could be spotted. Damn you, I\\'ll pull that thing\\noffâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94\"\\n\\n\"Stop!\" The hoarse, oddly alien voice of the Swami held a tone beyond\\nall mere earthly fright. \"I told you there was another form of proof\\nwhich I could give if necessary , and I warned you not to provoke me to\\nit. This red-faced old meddler is rightâ\\x80\\x94I\\'m not really an East Indian. This face is a mask, and what it covers is not human. You others have\\nguessedâ\\x80\\x94I felt that minutes ago. It wouldn\\'t be pleasant if I took\\nthat mask offâ\\x80\\x94let it alone, Ernest. I may as well tell you that I am\\nRandolph Carter .\"\\n\\nNo one moved. Aspinwall snorted and made vague motions. De Marigny\\nand Phillips, across the room, watched the workings of the red face\\nand studied the back of the turbaned figure that confronted him. The\\nclock\\'s abnormal ticking was hideous, and the tripod fumes and swaying\\narras danced a dance of death. The half-choking lawyer broke the\\nsilence.\\n\\n\"No you don\\'t, you crookâ\\x80\\x94you can\\'t scare me! You\\'ve reasons of your\\nown for not wanting that mask off. Maybe we\\'d know who you are. Off\\nwith itâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94\"\\n\\nAs he reached forward, the Swami seized his hand with one of his own\\nclumsily mittened members, evoking a curious cry of mixed pain and\\nsurprize. De Marigny started toward the two, but paused confused as\\nthe pseudo-Hindoo\\'s shout of protest changed to a wholly inexplicable\\nrattling and buzzing sound. Aspinwall\\'s red face was furious, and with\\nhis free hand he made another lunge at his opponent\\'s bushy beard.\\nThis time he succeeded in getting a hold, and at his frantic tug the\\nwhole waxen visage came loose from the turban and clung to the lawyer\\'s\\napoplectic fist.\\n\\nAs it did so, Aspinwall uttered a frightful gurgling cry, and Phillips\\nand de Marigny saw his face convulsed with a wilder, deeper and more\\nhideous epilepsy of stark panic than ever they had seen on human\\ncountenance before. The pseudo-Swami had meanwhile released his other\\nhand and was standing as if dazed, making buzzing noises of a most\\nabnormal quality. Then the turbaned figure slumped oddly into a posture\\nscarcely human, and began a curious, fascinated sort of shuffle toward\\nthe coffin-shaped clock that ticked out its cosmic and abnormal rhythm.\\nHis now uncovered face was turned away, and de Marigny and Phillips\\ncould not see what the lawyer\\'s act had disclosed. Then their attention\\nwas turned to Aspinwall, who was sinking ponderously to the floor. The\\nspell was brokenâ\\x80\\x94but when they reached the old man he was dead.\\n\\nTurning quickly to the shuffling Swami\\'s receding back, de Marigny saw\\none of the great white mittens drop listlessly off a dangling arm. The\\nfumes of the olibanum were thick, and all that could be glimpsed of the\\nrevealed hand was something long and black. Before the Creole could\\nreach the retreating figure, old Mr. Phillips laid a restraining hand\\non his shoulder.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t!\" he whispered. \"We don\\'t know what we\\'re up against. That other\\nfacet, you knowâ\\x80\\x94Zkauba, the wizard of Yaddith....\"\\n\\nThe turbaned figure had now reached the abnormal clock, and the\\nwatchers saw through the dense fumes a blurred black claw fumbling with\\nthe tall, hieroglyphed door. The fumbling made a queer, clicking sound.\\nThen the figure entered the coffin-shaped case and pulled the door shut\\nafter it.\\n\\nDe Marigny could no longer be restrained, but when he reached and\\nopened the clock it was empty. The abnormal ticking went on, beating\\nout the dark, cosmic rhythm which underlies all mystical gate-openings.\\nOn the floor the great white mitten, and the dead man with a bearded\\nmask clutched in his hand, had nothing further to reveal.\\n\\nA year passed, and nothing has been heard of Randolph Carter. His\\nestate is still unsettled. The Boston address from which one \"Swami\\nChandraputra\" sent inquiries to various mystics in 1930-31-32 was\\nindeed tenanted by a strange Hindoo, but he left shortly before the\\ndate of the New Orleans conference and has never been seen since. He\\nwas said to be dark, expressionless, and bearded, and his landlord\\nthinks the swarthy maskâ\\x80\\x94which was duly exhibitedâ\\x80\\x94looks very much\\nlike him. He was never, however, suspected of any connection with the\\nnightmare apparitions whispered of by local Slavs. The hills behind\\nArkham were searched for the \"metal envelope,\" but nothing of the sort\\nwas ever found. However, a clerk in Arkham\\'s First National Bank does\\nrecall a queer turbaned man who cashed an odd bit of gold bullion in\\nOctober, 1930.\\n\\nDe Marigny and Phillips scarcely know what to make of the business.\\nAfter all, what was proved? There was a story. There was a key which\\nmight have been forged from one of the pictures Carter had freely\\ndistributed in 1928. There were papersâ\\x80\\x94all indecisive. There was a\\nmasked stranger, but who now living saw behind the mask? Amidst the\\nstrain and the olibanum fumes that act of vanishing in the clock might\\neasily have been a dual hallucination. Hindoos know much of hypnotism.\\nReason proclaims the \"Swami\" a criminal with designs on Randolph\\nCarter\\'s estate. But the autopsy said that Aspinwall had died of shock.\\nWas it rage alone which caused it? And some things in that story....\\n\\nIn a vast room hung with strangely figured arras and filled with\\nolibanum fumes, Etienne-Laurent de Marigny often sits listening\\nwith vague sensations to the abnormal rhythm of that hieroglyphed,\\ncoffin-shaped clock.',\n",

LOVECRAFT\\n\\nUnspeakable monstrousness over-hung the crumbling, stench-cursed town of Innsmouth ... and folks there had somehow got out of the idea of dying....\\n\\n[Transcriber\\'s Note: This etext was produced from Weird Tales January 1942. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\\n\\nDuring the winter of 1927-28 Federal government officials made a\\nstrange and secret investigation of certain conditions in the ancient\\nMassachusetts seaport of Innsmouth. The public first learned of it in\\nFebruary, when a vast series of raids and arrests occurred, followed by\\nthe deliberate burning and dynamitingâ\\x80\\x94under suitable precautionsâ\\x80\\x94of\\nan enormous number of crumbling, worm-eaten, and supposedly empty\\nhouses along the abandoned waterfront. Uninquiring souls let this\\noccurrence pass as one of the major clashes in a spasmodic war on\\nliquor.\\n\\nKeener news-followers, however, wondered at the prodigious number of\\narrests, the abnormally large force of men used in making them, and\\nthe secrecy surrounding the disposal of the prisoners. No trials, or\\neven definite charges, were reported; nor were any of the captives\\nseen thereafter in the regular jails of the nation. There were vague\\nstatements about disease and concentration camps, and later about\\ndispersal in various naval and military prisons, but nothing positive\\never developed.\\n\\nComplaints from many liberal organizations were met with long\\nconfidential discussions, and representatives were taken on trips\\nto certain camps and prisons. As a result, these societies became\\nsurprisingly passive and reticent. Newspaper men were harder to\\nmanage, but seemed largely to cooperate with the government in the\\nend. Only one paperâ\\x80\\x94a tabloid always discounted because of its\\nwild policyâ\\x80\\x94mentioned the deep-diving submarine that discharged\\ntorpedoes downward in the marine abyss just beyond Devil Reef. That\\nitem, gathered by chance in a haunt of sailors, seemed indeed rather\\nfar-fetched; since the low, black reef lies a full mile and a half out\\nfrom Innsmouth Harbor.\\n\\nBut at last I am going to defy the ban on speech about this thing.\\nResults, I am certain, are so thorough that no public harm save a shock\\nof repulsion could ever accrue from a hinting of what was found by\\nthose horrified raiders at Innsmouth. For my contact with this affair\\nhas been closer than that of any other layman, and I have carried away\\nimpressions which are yet to drive me to drastic measures.\\n\\nIt was I who fled frantically out of Innsmouth in the early morning\\nhours of July 16, 1927, and whose frightened appeals for government\\ninquiry and action brought on the whole reported episode. I was willing\\nenough to stay mute while the affair was fresh and uncertain; but now\\nthat it is an old story, with public interest and curiosity gone, I\\nhave an odd craving to whisper about those few frightful hours in\\nthat ill-rumored and evilly-shadowed seaport of death and blasphemous\\nabnormality.\\n\\nI never heard of Innsmouth till the day before I saw it for the first\\nandâ\\x80\\x94so farâ\\x80\\x94last time. I was celebrating my coming of age by a tour\\nof New Englandâ\\x80\\x94sightseeing, antiquarian, and genealogicalâ\\x80\\x94and had\\nplanned to go directly from ancient Newburyport to Arkham, whence my\\nmother\\'s family was derived. I had no car, but was traveling by train,\\ntrolley, and motor-coach, always seeking the cheapest possible route.\\nIn Newburyport they told me that the steam train was the thing to\\ntake to Arkham; and it was only at the station ticket-office, when I\\ndemurred at the high fare, that I learned about Innsmouth. The stout,\\nshrewd-faced agent, whose speech showed him to be no local man, seemed\\nsympathetic toward my efforts at economy, and made a suggestion that\\nnone of my other informants had offered.\\n\\n\"You could take that old bus, I suppose,\" he said with a certain\\nhesitation, \"but it ain\\'t thought much of hereabouts. It goes through\\nInnsmouthâ\\x80\\x94you may have heard about thatâ\\x80\\x94and so the people don\\'t\\nlike it. Run by an Innsmouth fellowâ\\x80\\x94Joe Sargentâ\\x80\\x94but never gets any\\ncustom from here, or Arkham either, I guess. Leaves the Squareâ\\x80\\x94front\\nof Hammond\\'s Drug Storeâ\\x80\\x94at 10 A.M. and 7 P.M. unless they\\'ve changed\\nlately. Looks like a terrible rattletrapâ\\x80\\x94I\\'ve never been on it.\"\\n\\nThat was the first I ever heard of shadowed Innsmouth. Any reference\\nto a town not shown on common maps or listed in recent guidebooks\\nwould have interested me, and the agent\\'s old manner of allusion\\nroused something like real curiosity. So I asked the agent to tell me\\nsomething about it.\\n\\nHe was very deliberate, and spoke with an air of feeling slightly\\nsuperior to what he said.\\n\\n\"Innsmouth? Well, it\\'s a queer kind of town down at the mouth of\\nthe Manuxet. Used to be almost a cityâ\\x80\\x94quite a port before the War\\nof 1812â\\x80\\x94but all gone to pieces in the last hundred years or so. No\\nrailroad nowâ\\x80\\x94B. & M. never went through, and the branch line from\\nRowley was given up years ago.\\n\\n\"More empty houses than there are people, I guess, and no business to\\nspeak of except fishing and lobstering. Everybody trades mostly either\\nhere or in Arkham or Ipswich. Once they had quite a few mills, but\\nnothing\\'s left now except one gold refinery running on the leanest kind\\nof part time.\\n\\n\"That refinery, though, used to be a big thing, and Old Man Marsh,\\nwho owns it, must be richer\\'n Croesus. Queer old duck, though, and\\nsticks mighty close in his home. He\\'s supposed to have developed\\nsome skin disease or deformity late in life that makes him keep out\\nof sight. Grandson of Captain Obed Marsh, who founded the business.\\nHis mother seems to\\'ve been some kind of foreignerâ\\x80\\x94they say a South\\nSea islanderâ\\x80\\x94so everybody raised Cain when he married an Ipswich\\ngirl fifty years ago. They always do that about Innsmouth people, and\\nfolks here and hereabouts always try to cover up any Innsmouth blood\\nthey have in \\'em. But Marsh\\'s children and grandchildren look just\\nlike anybody else so far\\'s I can see. I\\'ve had \\'em pointed out to me\\nhereâ\\x80\\x94though, come to think of it, the elder children don\\'t seem to be\\naround lately. Never saw the old man.\\n\\n\"And why is everybody so down on Innsmouth? Well, young fellow, you\\nmustn\\'t take too much stock in what people around here say. They\\'re\\nhard to get started, but once they do get started they never let\\nup. They\\'ve been telling things about Innsmouthâ\\x80\\x94whispering \\'em,\\nmostlyâ\\x80\\x94for the last hundred years, I guess, and I gather they\\'re\\nmore scared than anything else. Some of the stories would make you\\nlaughâ\\x80\\x94about old Captain Marsh driving bargains with the devil and\\nbringing imps out of hell to live in Innsmouth, or about some kind of\\ndevil-worship and awful sacrifices in some place near the wharves that\\npeople stumbled on around 1845 or there-aboutsâ\\x80\\x94but I come from Panton,\\nVermont, and that kind of story don\\'t go down with me.\\n\\n\"You ought to hear, though, what some of the old-timers tell about\\nthe black reef off the coastâ\\x80\\x94Devil Reef, they call it. It\\'s well\\nabove water a good part of the time, and never much below it, but at\\nthat you could hardly call it an island. The story is that there\\'s a\\nwhole legion of devils seen sometimes on that reefâ\\x80\\x94sprawled about,\\nor darting in and out of some kind of caves near the top. It\\'s a\\nrugged, uneven thing, a good bit over a mile out, and toward the end of\\nshipping days sailors used to make big detours just to avoid it.\\n\\n\"That is, sailors that didn\\'t hail from Innsmouth. One of the things\\nthey had against old Captain Marsh was that he was supposed to land on\\nit sometimes at night when the tide was right. Maybe he did, for I dare\\nsay the rock formation was interesting, and it\\'s just barely possible\\nhe was looking for pirate loot and maybe finding it; but there was talk\\nof his dealing with demons there. Fact is, I guess on the whole it was\\nreally the captain that gave the bad reputation to the reef.\\n\\n\"That was before the big epidemic of 1846, when over half the folks\\nin Innsmouth was carried off. They never did quite figure out what\\nthe trouble was, but it was probably some foreign kind of disease\\nbrought from China or somewhere by the shipping. It surely was bad\\nenoughâ\\x80\\x94there was riots over it, and all sorts of ghastly doings that I\\ndon\\'t believe ever got outside of townâ\\x80\\x94and it left the place in awful\\nshape. Never came backâ\\x80\\x94there can\\'t be more\\'n 300 or 400 people living\\nthere now.\\n\\n\"But the real thing behind the way folks feel is simply race\\nprejudiceâ\\x80\\x94and I don\\'t say I\\'m blaming those that hold it. I hate\\nthose Innsmouth folks myself, and I wouldn\\'t care to go to their\\ntown. I s\\'pose you knowâ\\x80\\x94though I can see you\\'re a Westerner by your\\ntalkâ\\x80\\x94what a lot our New England ships used to have to do with queer\\nports in Africa, Asia, the South Seas, and everywhere else, and what\\nqueer kinds of people they sometimes brought back with \\'em. You\\'ve\\nprobably heard about the Salem man that came home with a Chinese wife,\\nand maybe you know there\\'s still a bunch of Fiji Islanders somewhere\\naround Cape Cod.\\n\\n\"Well, there must be something like that back of the Innsmouth people.\\nThe place always was badly cut off from the rest of the country by\\nmarshes and creeks, and we can\\'t be sure about the ins and outs of\\nthe matter; but it\\'s pretty clear that old Captain Marsh must have\\nbrought home some odd specimens when he had all three of his ships in\\ncommission back in the twenties and thirties. There certainly is a\\nstrange kind of a streak in the Innsmouth folks todayâ\\x80\\x94I don\\'t know how\\nto explain it, but it sort of makes you crawl. You\\'ll notice a little\\nin Sargent if you take his bus. Some of \\'em have queer narrow heads\\nwith flat noses and bulgy, starey eyes that never seem to shut, and\\ntheir skin ain\\'t quite right. Rough and scabby, and the sides of their\\nnecks are all shriveled or creased up. Get bald, too, very young. The\\nolder fellows look the worstâ\\x80\\x94fact is, I don\\'t believe I\\'ve ever seen\\na very old chap of that kind. Guess they must die of looking in the\\nglass! Animals hate \\'emâ\\x80\\x94they used to have lots of horse trouble before\\nautos came in.\\n\\n\"Nobody can ever keep track of those people, and state school officials\\nand census men have a devil of a time. You can bet that prying\\nstrangers ain\\'t welcome around Innsmouth. I\\'ve heard personally of\\nmore\\'n one business or government man that\\'s disappeared there, and\\nthere\\'s loose talk of one who went crazy and is out at Danvers now.\\nThey must have fixed up some awful scare for that fellow.\\n\\n\"That\\'s why I wouldn\\'t go at night if I was you. I\\'ve never been there\\nand have no wish to go, but I guess a daytime trip couldn\\'t hurt\\nyouâ\\x80\\x94even though the people hereabouts will advise you not to make it.\\nIf you\\'re just sightseeing, and looking for old-time stuff, Innsmouth\\nought to be quite a place for you.\"\\n\\nAnd so I spent part of that evening at the Newburyport Public Library\\nlooking up data about Innsmouth. The Essex County histories on the\\nlibrary shelves had very little to say, except that the town was\\nfounded in 1643, noted for shipbuilding before the Revolution, a seat\\nof great marine prosperity in the early 19th century, and later a minor\\nfactory center using the Manuxet as power. The epidemic and riots of\\n1846 were very sparsely treated, as if they formed a discredit to the\\ncountry.\\n\\nReferences to decline were few, though the significance of the later\\nrecord was unmistakable. After the Civil War all industrial life was\\nconfined to the Marsh Refining Company, and the marketing of gold\\ningots formed the only remaining bit of major commerce aside from the\\neternal fishing.\\n\\nMost interesting of all was a glancing reference to the strange jewelry\\nvaguely associated with Innsmouth. It had evidently impressed the whole\\ncountryside more than a little, for mention was made of specimens in\\nthe museum of Miskatonic University at Arkham, and in the display room\\nof the Newburyport Historical Society. I resolved to see the local\\nsampleâ\\x80\\x94said to be a large, queerly-proportioned thing evidently meant\\nfor a tiaraâ\\x80\\x94if it could possibly be arranged.\\n\\nThe librarian gave me a note of introduction to the curator of the\\nSociety, a Miss Anna Tilton, who lived nearby, and after a brief\\nexplanation that ancient gentlewoman was kind enough to pilot me into\\nthe closed building, since the hour was not outrageously late. The\\ncollection was a notable one indeed, but in my present mood I had eyes\\nfor nothing but the bizarre object which glistened in a corner cupboard\\nunder the electric lights.\\n\\nIt took no excessive sensitiveness to beauty to make me literally gasp\\nat the strange, unearthly splendor of the alien, opulent phantasy that\\nrested there on a purple velvet cushion. The longer I looked, the more\\nthe thing fascinated me; and in this fascination there was a curiously\\ndisturbing element hardly to be classified or accounted for. I decided\\nthat it was the queer other-worldly quality of the art which made me\\nuneasy. It was as if the workmanship were that of another planet.\\n\\nThe patterns all hinted of remote secrets and unimaginable abysses in\\ntime and space, and the monotonously aquatic nature of the reliefs\\nbecame almost sinister. Among these reliefs were fabulous monsters of\\nabhorrent grotesqueness and malignityâ\\x80\\x94wholly primal and awesomely\\nancestral.\\n\\nAt times I fancied that every contour of these blasphemous fish-frogs\\nwas overflowing with the ultimate quintessence of unknown and inhuman\\nevil.\\n\\nIn odd contrast to the tiara\\'s aspect was its brief and prosy history\\nas related by Miss Tilton. It had been pawned for a ridiculous sum at\\na shop in State Street in 1873, by a drunken Innsmouth man shortly\\nafterward killed in a brawl.\\n\\nMiss Tilton was inclined to believe that it formed part of some exotic\\npirate hoard discovered by old Captain Obed Marsh. This view was surely\\nnot weakened by the insistent offers of purchase at a high price\\nwhich the Marshes began to make as soon as they knew of its presence,\\nand which they repeated to this day despite the Society\\'s unvarying\\ndetermination not to sell.\\n\\nAs the good lady showed me out of the building, she assured me that the\\nrumors of devil-worship were partly justified by a peculiar secret cult\\nwhich had gained force there and engulfed all the orthodox churches.\\n\\nIt was called, she said, \"The Esoteric Order of Dagon,\" and was\\nundoubtedly a debased, quasi-pagan thing imported from the East a\\ncentury before, at a time when Innsmouth fisheries seemed to be going\\nbarren. Its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view\\nof the sudden and permanent return of abundantly fine fishing, and it\\nsoon came to be the greatest influence on the town.\\n\\nAll this, to the pious Miss Tilton, formed an excellent reason for\\nshunning the ancient town of decay and desolation; but to me it was\\nmerely a fresh incentive; and I could scarcely sleep in my small room\\nat the \"Y\" as the night wore away.\\n\\nII\\n\\nShortly before ten the next morning I stood with my one small valise\\nin front of Hammond\\'s Drug Store in old Market Square waiting for\\nthe Innsmouth bus. In a few moments a small motor-coach of extreme\\ndecrepitude and dirty gray color rattled down State Street, made a\\nturn, and drew up at the curb beside me. I felt immediately that\\nit was the right one; a guess which the half-illegible sign on the\\nwindshieldâ\\x80\\x94\" Arkham-Innsmouth-Newb\\'port \"â\\x80\\x94soon verified.\\n\\nThere were only three passengersâ\\x80\\x94dark, unkempt men of sullen visage\\nand somewhat youthful castâ\\x80\\x94and when the vehicle stopped they clumsily\\nshambled out and began walking up State Street in a silent, almost\\nfurtive fashion. The driver also alighted. This, I reflected, must be\\nthe Joe Sargent mentioned by the ticket-agent; and even before I had\\nnoticed any details there spread over me a wave of spontaneous aversion\\nwhich could be neither checked nor explained.\\n\\nHe was a thin, stoop-shouldered man not much under six feet tall,\\ndressed in shabby blue civilian clothes and wearing a frayed gray golf\\ncap. His age was perhaps thirty-five, but the odd, deep creases in the\\nsides of his neck made him seem older when one did not study his dull,\\nexpressionless face. He had a narrow head, bulging, watery blue eyes\\nthat seemed never to wink, a flat nose, a receding forehead and chin,\\nand singularly undeveloped ears. As he walked toward the bus I observed\\nhis peculiarly shambling gait and saw that his feet were inordinately\\nimmense. The more I studied them the more I wondered how he could buy\\nany shoes to fit them.\\n\\nA certain greasiness about the fellow increased my dislike. He was\\nevidently given to working or lounging around the fish docks, and\\ncarried with him much of their characteristic smell. Just what foreign\\nblood was in him I could not even guess.\\n\\nI was sorry when I saw that there would be no other passengers on the\\nbus. Somehow I did not like the idea of riding alone with this driver.\\nBut as the leaving time obviously approached I conquered my qualms and\\nfollowed the man aboard, extending him a dollar bill and murmuring the\\nsingle word \"Innsmouth.\"\\n\\nAt length the decrepit vehicle started with a jerk, and rattled noisily\\npast the old brick buildings of State Street amidst a cloud of vapor\\nfrom the exhaust.\\n\\nThe day was warm and sunny, but the landscape of sand, sedge-grass,\\nand stunted shrubbery became more and more desolate as we proceeded.\\nOut the window I could see the blue water and the sandy line of Plum\\nIsland, and we presently drew very near the beach as our narrow road\\nveered off from the main highway to Rowley and Ipswich.\\n\\nAt last we lost sight of Plum Island and saw the vast expanse of the\\nopen Atlantic on our left. Our narrow course began to climb steeply,\\nand I felt a singular sense of disquiet in looking at the lonely crest\\nahead where the rutted roadway met the sky. It was as if the bus were\\nabout to keep on its ascent leaving the sane earth altogether and\\nmerging with the unknown arcana of upper air and cryptical sky. The\\nsmell of the sea took on ominous implications, and the silent driver\\'s\\nbent, rigid back and narrow head became more and more hateful. As I\\nlooked at him I saw that the back of his head was almost as hairless\\nas his face, having only a few straggling yellow strands upon a gray\\nscabrous surface.\\n\\nThen we reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond,\\nwhere the Manuxet joins the sea just north of the long line of cliffs\\nthat culminate in Kingsport Head; all my attention was captured by the\\nnearer panorama just below me. I had, I realized, come face to face\\nwith rumor-shadowed Innsmouth.\\n\\nIt was a town of wide extent and dense construction, yet one with a\\nportentous dearth of visible life. The vast huddle of sagging gambrel\\nroofs and peaked gables conveyed with offensive clearness the idea\\nof wormy decay, and as we approached along the now descending road I\\ncould see that many roofs had wholly caved in. Stretching inland I saw\\nthe rusted, grass-grown line of the abandoned railway, with leaning\\ntelegraph-poles now devoid of wires.\\n\\nHere and there the ruins of wharves jutted out from the shore to end\\nin indeterminate rottenness, those farthest south seeming the most\\ndecayed. And far out at sea, despite a high tide, I glimpsed a long,\\nblack line scarcely rising above the water yet carrying a suggestion of\\nodd latent malignancy. This, I knew, must be Devil Reef. As I looked,\\na subtle, curious sense of beckoning seemed superadded to the grim\\nrepulsion; and oddly enough, I found this overtone more disturbing than\\nthe primary impression.\\n\\nAs the bus reached a lower level I began to catch the steady note of\\na waterfall through the unnatural stillness. The leaning, unpainted\\nhouses grew thicker, lined both sides of the road, and displayed more\\nurban tendencies than did those we were leaving behind. The panorama\\nahead had contracted to a street scene, and in spots I could see\\nwhere a cobblestone pavement and stretches of brick sidewalk had\\nformerly existed. All the houses were apparently deserted, and there\\nwere occasional gaps where tumbledown chimneys and cellar walls told\\nof buildings that had collapsed. Pervading everything was the most\\nnauseous fishy odor imaginable.\\n\\nAnd I was not to reach my destination without one other very strong\\nimpression of poignantly disagreeable quality. The bus had come to a\\nsort of open concourse or radial point with churches on two sides and\\nthe bedraggled remains of a circular green in the center, and I was\\nlooking at a large pillared hall on the right-hand junction ahead. The\\nstructure\\'s once white paint was now gray and peeling, and the black\\nand gold sign on the pediment was so faded that I could only with\\ndifficulty make out the words \"Esoteric Order of Dagon.\"\\n\\nThe door of the church basement was open, revealing a rectangle of\\nblackness inside. And as I looked, a certain object crossed or seemed\\nto cross that dark rectangle; burning into my brain a momentary\\nconception of nightmare which was all the more maddening because\\nanalysis could not show a single nightmarish quality in it.\\n\\nIt was a living objectâ\\x80\\x94the first except the driver that I had seen\\nsince entering the compact part of the townâ\\x80\\x94and had I been in a\\nsteadier mood I would have found nothing whatever of terror in it.\\nClearly, as I realized a moment later, it was the pastor; clad in\\nsome peculiar vestments doubtless introduced since the Order of Dagon\\nhad modified the ritual of the local churches. The thing which had\\nprobably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied the touch of\\nbizarre horror was the tall tiara he wore; an almost exact duplicate\\nof the one Miss Tilton had shown me the previous evening. This, acting\\non my imagination, had supplied namelessly sinister qualities to the\\nindeterminate face and robed, shambling form beneath it.\\n\\nA very thin sprinkling of repellent-looking youngish people now became\\nvisible on the sidewalksâ\\x80\\x94lone individuals, and silent knots of two\\nor three. The lower floors of the crumbling houses sometimes harbored\\nsmall shops with dingy signs, and I noticed a parked truck or two as we\\nrattled along. The sound of waterfalls became more and more distinct,\\nand presently I saw a fairly deep river-gorge ahead, spanned by a wide,\\niron-railed highway bridge beyond which a large square opened out. Then\\nwe rolled into the large semicircular square across the river and drew\\nup on the right-hand side in front of a tall, cupola-crowned building\\nwith remnants of yellow paint and with a half-effaced sign proclaiming\\nit to be the Gilman House.\\n\\nI was glad to get out of that bus, and at once proceeded to check\\nmy valise in the shabby hotel lobby. There was only one person in\\nsightâ\\x80\\x94an elderly man without what I had come to call the \"Innsmouth\\nlook\"â\\x80\\x94and I decided not to ask him any of the questions which bothered\\nme; remembering that odd things had been noticed in this hotel.\\nInstead, I strolled out on the square, from which the bus had already\\ngone, and studied the scene minutely and appraisingly.\\n\\nFor some reason or other I chose to make my first inquiries at\\nthe chain grocery, whose personnel was not likely to be native to\\nInnsmouth. I found a solitary boy of about seventeen in charge, and was\\npleased to note the brightness and affability which promised cheerful\\ninformation. He seemed exceptionally eager to talk, and I soon gathered\\nthat he did not like the place, its fishy smell, or its furtive people.\\nHis family did not like him to work in Innsmouth, but the chain had\\ntransferred him there and he did not wish to give up his job.\\n\\nThere was, he said, no public library or chamber of commerce in\\nInnsmouth, but I could probably find my way about. The street I had\\ncome down was Federal. West of that were the fine old residence\\nstreetsâ\\x80\\x94Broad, Washington, Lafayette, and Adamsâ\\x80\\x94and east of it were\\nthe shoreward slums.\\n\\nCertain spots were almost forbidden territory, as he had learned at\\nconsiderable cost. One must not, for example, linger much around the\\nMarsh refinery, or around any of the still used churches, or around the\\npillared Order of Dagon Hall at New Church Green. Those churches were\\nvery oddâ\\x80\\x94all violently disavowed by their respective denominations\\nelsewhere, and apparently using the queerest kind of ceremonials and\\nclerical vestments.\\n\\nAs for the Innsmouth peopleâ\\x80\\x94the youth hardly knew what to make of\\nthem. Their appearanceâ\\x80\\x94especially those staring, unwinking eyes which\\none never saw shutâ\\x80\\x94was certainly shocking enoughâ\\x80\\x94and their voices\\nwere disgusting. It was awful to hear them chanting in their churches\\nat night, and especially during their main festivals or revivals, which\\nfell twice a year on April 30 and October 31.\\n\\nThey were very fond of the water, and swam a great deal in both river\\nand harbor. Swimming races out to Devil Reef were very common, and\\neveryone in sight seemed well able to share in this arduous sport.\\n\\nIt would be of no use, my informant said, to ask the natives anything\\nabout the place. The only one who would talk was a very aged but\\nnormal-looking man who lived at the poorhouse on the north rim of the\\ntown and spent his time walking about or lounging around the fire\\nstation. This hoary character, Zadok Allen, was 96 years old and\\nsomewhat touched in the head, besides being the town drunkard. He was a\\nstrange, furtive creature who constantly looked over his shoulder as\\nif afraid of something, and when sober could not be persuaded to talk\\nat all with strangers. He was, however, unable to resist any offer of\\nhis favorite poison; and once drunk would furnish the most astonishing\\nfragments of whispered reminiscence.\\n\\nAfter all, though, little useful data could be gained from him; since\\nhis stories were all insane, incomplete hints of impossible marvels and\\nhorrors which could have no source save in his own distorted fancy.\\nNobody ever believed him, but the natives did not like him to drink\\nand talk with any strangers; and it was not always safe to be seen\\nquestioning him. It was probably from him that some of the wildest\\npopular whispers and delusions were derived.\\n\\nThe Marshes, together with the other three gently bred families of the\\ntownâ\\x80\\x94the Waites, the Gilmans, and the Eliotsâ\\x80\\x94were all very retiring.\\nThey lived in immense houses along Washington Street, and several were\\nreputed to harbor in concealment certain kinsfolk whose personal aspect\\nforbade public view, and whose deaths had been reported and recorded.\\n\\nWarning me that most of the street signs were down, the youth drew for\\nmy benefit a rough but ample and painstaking sketch map of the town\\'s\\nsalient features. After a moment\\'s study I felt sure that it would be\\nof great help, and pocketed it with profuse thanks.\\n\\nThus began my systematic though half-bewildered tour of Innsmouth\\'s\\nnarrow, shadow-blighted ways. Crossing the bridge and turning toward\\nthe roar of the lower falls, I passed close to the Marsh refinery,\\nwhich seemed oddly free from the noise of industry. This building\\nstood on the steep river bluff near a bridge and an open confluence of\\nstreets which I took to be the earliest civic center, displaced after\\nthe Revolution by the present Town Square.\\n\\nRe-crossing the gorge on the Main Street bridge, I struck a region of\\nutter desertion which somehow made me shudder. Collapsing huddles of\\ngambrel roofs formed a jagged and fantastic skyline, above which rose\\nthe ghoulish, decapitated steeple of an ancient church.\\n\\nFish Street was as deserted as Main, though it differed in having many\\nbrick and stone warehouses still in excellent shape. Water Street\\nwas almost its duplicate, save that there were great seaward gaps\\nwhere wharves had been. Not a living thing did I see, except for the\\nscattered fishermen on the distant breakwater, and not a sound did I\\nhear save the lapping of the harbor tides and the roar of the falls in\\nthe Manuxet.\\n\\nI kept north along Main to Martin, then turning inland, crossing\\nFederal Street safely north of the Green, and entering the decayed\\npatrician neighborhood of northern Broad, Washington, Lafayette, and\\nAdams Streets. Following Washington Street toward the river, I now\\nfaced a zone of former industry and commerce; noting the ruins of a\\nfactory ahead, and seeing others, with the traces of an old railway\\nstation and covered railway bridge beyond up the gorge on my right.\\n\\nThe uncertain bridge now before me was posted with a warning sign,\\nbut I took the risk and crossed again to the south bank where traces\\nof life reappeared. Furtive, shambling creatures stared cryptically\\nin my direction, and more normal faces eyed me coldly and curiously.\\nInnsmouth was rapidly becoming intolerable, and I turned down Paine\\nStreet toward the Square in the hope of getting some vehicle to take me\\nto Arkham before the still-distant starting time of that sinister bus.\\n\\nIt was then that I saw the tumbledown fire station on my left,\\nand noticed the red-faced, bushy-bearded, watery-eyed old man in\\nnondescript rags who sat on a bench in front of it talking with a pair\\nof unkempt but not abnormal-looking firemen. This, of course, must be\\nZadok Allen, the half-crazed, liquorish non-agenarian whose tales of\\nold Innsmouth and its shadow were so hideous and incredible.\\n\\nIII\\n\\nI had been assured that the old man could do nothing but hint at wild,\\ndisjointed, and incredible legends, and I had been warned that the\\nnatives made it unsafe to be seen talking with him; yet the thought\\nof this aged witness to the town\\'s decay, with memories going back to\\nthe early days of ships and factories, was a lure that no amount\\nof reason could make me resist. Curiosity flared up beyond sense and\\ncaution, and in my youthful egotism I fancied I might be able to sift\\na nucleus of real history from the confused, extravagant outpouring I\\nwould probably extract with the aid of whiskey.\\n\\nA quart bottle of such was easily, though not cheaply, obtained in the\\nrear of a dingy variety-store just off the Square in Eliot Street.\\n\\nRe-entering the Square I saw that luck was with me; forâ\\x80\\x94shuffling\\nout of Paine Street around the corner of the Gilman Houseâ\\x80\\x94I glimpsed\\nnothing less than the tall, lean, tattered form of old Zadok Allen\\nhimself. In accordance with my plan, I attracted his attention by\\nbrandishing my newly-purchased bottle; and soon realized that he had\\nbegun to shuffle wistfully after me as I turned into Waite Street on my\\nway to the most deserted region I could think of. Before I reached Main\\nStreet I could hear a faint and wheezy \"Hey, Mister!\" behind me, and I\\npresently allowed the old man to catch up and take copious pulls from\\nthe quart bottle.\\n\\nI began putting out feelers as we walked along to Water Street and\\nturned southward amidst the omnipresent desolation and crazily tilted\\nruins, but found that the aged tongue did not loosen as quickly\\nas I had expected. At length I saw a grass-grown opening toward\\nthe sea between crumbling brick walls, with the weedy length of an\\nearth-and-masonry wharf projecting beyond. Piles of moss-covered stones\\nnear the water promised tolerable seats, and the scene was sheltered\\nfrom all possible view by a ruined warehouse on the north.\\n\\nAbout four hours remained for conversation if I were to catch the eight\\no\\'clock coach for Arkham, and I began to dole out more liquor to the\\nancient tippler; meanwhile eating my own frugal lunch. In my donations\\nI was careful not to overshoot the mark, for I did not wish Zadok\\'s\\nvinous garrulousness to pass into a stupor. After an hour his furtive\\ntaciturnity showed signs of disappearing, and something or other had\\ncaused his wandering gaze to light on the low, distant line of Devil\\nReef, then showing plainly and almost fascinatingly above the waves. He\\nbent toward me, took hold of my coat lapel, and hissed out some hints\\nthat could not be mistaken.\\n\\n\"Thar\\'s whar it all begunâ\\x80\\x94that cursed place of all wickedness whar\\nthe deep water starts. Gate o\\' hellâ\\x80\\x94sheer drop daown to a bottom no\\nsaoundin\\'-line kin tech. Ol\\' Cap\\'n Obed done itâ\\x80\\x94him that faound aout\\nmore\\'n was good fer him in the Saouth Sea islands.\\n\\n\"Never was nobody like Cap\\'n Obedâ\\x80\\x94old limb o\\' Satan! Heh, heh! I kin\\nmind him a-tellin\\' abaout furren parts, an\\' callin\\' all the folks\\nstupid fer goin\\' to Christian meetin\\' an\\' bearin\\' their burdens meek\\nan\\' lowly. Says they\\'d orter git better gods like some o\\' the folks\\nin the Injiesâ\\x80\\x94gods as ud bring \\'em good fishin\\' in return fer their\\nsacrifices, an\\' ud reely answer folks\\'s prayers.\\n\\n\"Matt Eliot, his fust mate, talked a lot, too, only he was agin\\'\\nfolks\\'s doin\\' any heathen things. Told abaout an island east of\\nOthaheite whar they was a lot o\\' stone ruins older\\'n anybody knew\\nanything abaout, kind o\\' like them on Ponape, in the Carolines, but\\nwith carvin\\'s of faces that looked like the big statues on Easter\\nIsland. They was a little volcanic island near thar, too, whar they was\\nother ruins with diff\\'rent carvin\\'sâ\\x80\\x94ruins all wore away like they\\'d\\nben under the sea onct, an\\' with picters of awful monsters all over \\'em.\\n\\n\"Wal, Sir, Matt he says the natives araound thar had all the fish they\\ncud ketch, an\\' sported bracelets an\\' armlets an\\' head rigs made aout\\nof a queer kind o\\' gold an\\' covered with picters o\\' monsters jest like\\nthe ones carved over the ruins on the little islandâ\\x80\\x94sorter fishlike\\nfrogs or froglike fishes that was drawed in all kinds o\\' positions\\nlike they was human bein\\'s. Nobody cud git aout o\\' them whar they got\\nall the stuff, an\\' all the other natives wondered haow they managed to\\nfind fish in plenty even when the very next islands had lean pickin\\'s.\\nMatt he got to wonderin\\' too, an\\' so did Cap\\'n Obed. Obed, he notices,\\nbesides, that lots of the han\\'some young folks ud drop aout o\\' sight\\nfer good from year to year, an\\' that they wan\\'t many old folk araound.\\nAlso, he thinks some of the folks looks durned queer even fer Kanakys.\\n\\n\"It took Obed to git the truth aout o\\' them heathens. I dun\\'t know haow\\nhe done it, but he begun by tradin\\' fer the gold-like things they wore.\\nAst \\'em whar they come from, an\\' ef they cud git more, an\\' finally\\nwormed the story aout o\\' the old chiefâ\\x80\\x94Walakea, they called him.\\nNobody but Obed ud ever a believed the old yeller devil, but the Cap\\'n\\ncud read folks like they was books.

It seems\\nthese Kanakys was sacrificin\\' heaps o\\' their young men an\\' maidens to\\nsome kind o\\' god-things that lived under the sea, an\\' gittin\\' all kinds\\no\\' favors in return. They met the things on the little islet with the\\nqueer ruins, an\\' it seems them awful picters o\\' frog-fish monsters was\\nsupposed to be picters o\\' these things. Mebbe they was the kind o\\'\\ncritters as got all the mermaids stories an\\' sech started. They had all\\nkinds o\\' cities on the sea-bottom, an\\' this island was heaved up from\\nthar.

Seems that human folks has got a kind o\\' relation to\\nsech water-beastsâ\\x80\\x94that everything alive come aout o\\' the water onct,\\nan\\' only needs a little change to go back agin. Them things told the\\nKanakys that ef they mixed bloods there\\'d be children as ud look human\\nat fust, but later turn more\\'n more like the things, till finally\\nthey\\'d take to the water an\\' jine the main lot o\\' things daown thar.\\nAn\\' this is the important part, young fellerâ\\x80\\x94them as turned into fish\\nthings an\\' went into the water wouldn\\'t never die . Them things never\\ndied excep\\' they was kilt violent.\\n\\n\"Wal, Sir, it seems by the time Obed knowed them islanders they was all\\nfull o\\' fish blood from them deep-water things. When they got old an\\'\\nbegun to show it, they was kep\\' hid until they felt like takin\\' to the\\nwater an\\' quittin\\' the place. Some was more teched than others, an\\'\\nsome never did change quite enough to take to the water; but mostly\\nthey turned aout jest the way them things said. Them as was born more\\nlike the things changed arly, but them as was nearly human sometimes\\nstayed on the island till they was past seventy, though they\\'d usually\\ngo daown under fer trial trips afore that. Folks as had took to the\\nwater, gen\\'rally come back a good deal to visit, so\\'s a man ud often be\\na-talkin\\' to his own five-times-great-grandfather, who\\'d left the dry\\nland a couple o\\' hundred years or so afore.\\n\\n\"Everybody got aout o\\' the idee o\\' dyin\\'â\\x80\\x94excep\\' in canoe wars with\\nthe other islanders, or as sacrifices to the sea-gods daown below, or\\nfrom snake-bite or plague or sharp gallopin\\' ailments or somethin\\'\\nafore they cud take to the waterâ\\x80\\x94but simply looked forrad to a kind\\no\\' change that wa\\'n\\'t a bit horrible arter a while. They thought what\\nthey\\'d got was well wuth all they\\'d had to give upâ\\x80\\x94an\\' I guess Obed\\nkind o\\' come to think the same hisself when he\\'d chewed over old\\nWalakea\\'s story a bit. Walakea, though, was one of the few as hadn\\'t\\ngot none of the fish bloodâ\\x80\\x94bein\\' of a royal line that intermarried\\nwith royal lines on other islands.\\n\\n\"Walakea give him a funny kind o\\' thingumajig made aout o\\' lead or\\nsomething, that he said ud bring up the fish things from any place in\\nthe water whar they might be a nest of \\'em. The idee was to drop it\\ndaown with the right kind o\\' prayers an\\' sech. Walakea allaowed as was\\nthe things was scattered all over the world, so\\'s anybody that looked\\nabaout cud find a nest an\\' bring \\'em up ef they was wanted.\\n\\n\"Matt he didn\\'t like this business at all, an\\' wanted Obed shud keep\\naway from the island; but the Cap\\'n was sharp fer gain, an\\' faound\\nhe cud git them gold-like things so cheap it ud pay him to make a\\nspecialty of \\'em.\\n\\n\"Things went on that way fer years, an\\' Obed got enough o\\' that\\ngold-like stuff to make him start the refinery in Waite\\'s old run-daown\\nfullin\\' mill.\\n\\n\"Wall, come abaout \\'thutty-eightâ\\x80\\x94when I was seven year\\' oldâ\\x80\\x94Obed he\\nfaound the island people all wiped aout between v\\'yages. Seems the\\nother islanders had got wind o\\' what was goin\\' on, an\\' had took matters\\ninto their own hands. S\\'pose they must a had, arter all, them old magic\\nsigns as the sea things says was the only things they was afeard of. No\\ntellin\\' what any o\\' them Kanakys will chance to git a holt of when the\\nsea-bottom throws up some island with ruins older\\'n the deluge. Pious\\ncusses, these wasâ\\x80\\x94they didn\\'t leave nothin\\' standin\\' on either the\\nmain island or the little volcanic islet excep\\' what parts of the ruins\\nwas too big to knock daown.\\n\\n\"That naturally hit Obed pretty hard, seein\\' as his normal trade\\nwas doin\\' very poor. It hit the whole of Innsmouth, too, because in\\nseafarin\\' days what profited the master of a ship gen\\'lly profited the\\ncrew proportionate. Most o\\' the folks araound the taown took the hard\\ntimes kind o\\' sheeplike an\\' resigned, but they was in bad shape because\\nthe fishin\\' was peterin\\' aout an\\' the mills wa\\'n\\'t doin\\' none too well.\\n\\n\"Then\\'s the time Obed he begun a-cursin\\' at the folks fer bein\\' dull\\nsheep an\\' prayin\\' to a Christian heaven as didn\\'t help \\'em none. He\\ntold \\'em he\\'d knowed of folks as prayed to gods that give somethin\\' ye\\nreely need, an\\' says ef a good bunch o\\' men ud stand by him, he cud\\nmebbe git a holt o\\' sarten paowers as ud bring plenty o\\' fish an\\' quite\\na bit o\\' gold.\"\\n\\nHere the old man faltered, mumbled, and lapsed into a moody and\\napprehensive silence; glancing nervously over his shoulder and then\\nturning back to stare fascinatedly at the distant black reef. When\\nI spoke to him he did not answer, so I knew I would have to let him\\nfinish the bottle. He licked its nose and slipped it into his pocket,\\nthen beginning to nod and whisper softly to himself. I bent close to\\ncatch any articulate words he might utter, and thought I saw a sardonic\\nsmile behind the stained, bushy whiskers. Yesâ\\x80\\x94he was really forming\\nwords, and I could grasp a fair proportion of them.\\n\\n\"Poor Mattâ\\x80\\x94Matt he allus was agin itâ\\x80\\x94tried to line up the folks on\\nhis side, an\\' had long talks with the preachersâ\\x80\\x94no useâ\\x80\\x94they run\\nthe Congregational parson aout o\\' taown, an\\' the Methodist feller\\nquitâ\\x80\\x94never did see Resolved Babcock, the Baptist parson, aginâ\\x80\\x94Wrath\\no\\' Jehovyâ\\x80\\x94I was a mighty little critter, but I heerd what I heerd an\\'\\nseen what I seenâ\\x80\\x94Dagon an\\' Ashtorethâ\\x80\\x94Belial an\\' BeÃ«lzebubâ\\x80\\x94Golden\\nCaff an\\' the idols o\\' Canaan an\\' the Philistinesâ\\x80\\x94Babylonish\\nabominationsâ\\x80\\x94 Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin â\\x80\\x94\"\\n\\nHe stopped again, and from the look in his watery blue eyes I feared he\\nwas close to a stupor after all. But when I gently shook his shoulder\\nhe turned on me with astonishing alertness and snapped out some more\\nobscure phrases.\\n\\n\"Dun\\'t believe me, hey? Heh, heh, hehâ\\x80\\x94then just tell me, young feller,\\nwhy Cap\\'n Obed an\\' twenty odd other folks used to row aout to Devil\\nReef in the dead o\\' night an\\' chant things so laoud ye cud hear \\'em\\nall over taown when the wind was right?

Tell me what he done with that funny-shaped lead\\nthingumajig as Walakea give him? Hey, boy?\"\\n\\nThe watery blue eyes were almost savage and maniacal now, and the dirty\\nwhite beard bristled electrically. Old Zadok probably saw me shrink\\nback, for he began to cackle evilly.\\n\\n\"Heh, heh, heh, heh! Beginnin\\' to see, hey? Haow abaout the night I\\ntook my pa\\'s ship\\'s glass up to a cupalo an\\' seed the reef a-bristlin\\'\\nthick with shapes that dove off quick soon\\'s the moon riz?

Haow\\'d ye like to be a little shaver\\nalone up in a cupalo a-watchin\\' shapes as wa\\'n\\'t human shapes ?...\\nHey?... Heh, heh, heh, heh....\"\\n\\nThe old man was getting hysterical, and I began to shiver with a\\nnameless alarm. He laid a gnarled claw on my shoulder, and it seemed to\\nme that its shaking was not altogether that of mirth.\\n\\n\"S\\'pose one night ye seed somethin\\' heavy heaved offen Obed\\'s dory\\nbeyond the reef, an\\' then larned nex\\' day a young feller was missin\\'\\nfrom home?

The\\ntide had turned and was coming in now, and the sound of the waves\\nseemed to arouse him.\\n\\n\"That awful night.... I seed \\'em....

They say he still wears clothes, but he\\'ll\\ntake to the water soon.\" ...\\n\\nThe sound of the incoming tide was now very insistent, and little by\\nlittle it seemed to change the old man\\'s mood from maudlin tearfulness\\nto watchful fear. He would pause now and then to renew those nervous\\nglances over his shoulder or out toward the reef, and despite the wild\\nabsurdity of his tale, I could not help beginning to share his vague\\napprehensiveness. Zadok now grew shriller, and seemed to be trying to\\nwhip up his courage with louder speech.\\n\\n\"Hey, yew, why dun\\'t ye say somethin\\'? Haow\\'d ye like to be livin\\' in a\\ntaown like this, with everything a-rottin\\' an\\' a-dyin\\', an\\' boarded-up\\nmonsters crawlin\\' an\\' bleatin\\' an\\' barkin\\' an\\' hoppin\\' araoun\\' black\\ncellars an\\' attics every way ye turn?

EH-AHHHHâ\\x80\\x94AH! E\\'YAAHHHH....\"\\n\\nThe hideous suddenness and inhuman frightfulness of the old man\\'s\\nshriek almost made me faint. His eyes, looking past me toward the\\nmalodorous sea, were positively starting from his head; while his\\nface was a mask of fear worthy of Greek tragedy. His bony claw dug\\nmonstrously into my shoulder, and he made no motion as I turned my head\\nto look at whatever he had glimpsed.\\n\\nThere was nothing that I could see. Only the incoming tide, with\\nperhaps one set of ripples more local than the long-flung line of\\nbreakers. But now Zadok was shaking me, and I turned back to watch the\\nmelting of that fear-frozen face into a chaos of twitching eyelids and\\nmumbling gums. Presently his voice came backâ\\x80\\x94albeit as a trembling\\nwhisper.\\n\\n\" Git aout o\\' here! Git aout o\\' here! They seen us â\\x80\\x94git aout\\nfer your life!

And when I\\nreached Water Street and looked along it toward the north there was no\\nremaining trace of Zadok Allen.\\n\\nIV\\n\\nI can hardly describe the mood in which I was left by this harrowing\\nepisodeâ\\x80\\x94an episode at once mad and pitiful, grotesque and terrifying.\\nThe grocery boy had prepared me for it, yet the reality left me none\\nthe less bewildered and disturbed. Puerile though the story was, old\\nZadok\\'s insane earnestness and horror had communicated to me a mounting\\nunrest which joined with my earlier sense of loathing for the town and\\nits blight of intangible shadow.\\n\\nThe hour had grown perilously lateâ\\x80\\x94my watch said 7:15, and the Arkham\\nbus left Town Square at eightâ\\x80\\x94so I tried to give my thoughts as\\nneutral and practical a cast as possible, meanwhile walking rapidly\\nthrough the deserted streets of gaping roofs and leaning houses toward\\nthe hotel where I had checked my valise and would find my bus.\\n\\nStudying the grocery youth\\'s map and seeking a route I had not\\ntraversed before, I chose Marsh Street instead of State for my approach\\nto Town Square. Near the corner of Fall Street I began to see scattered\\ngroups of furtive whisperers, and when I finally reached the Square I\\nsaw that almost all the loiterers were congregated around the door of\\nthe Gilman House. It seemed as if many bulging, watery, unwinking eyes\\nlooked oddly at me as I claimed my valise in the lobby, and I hoped\\nthat none of these unpleasant creatures would be my fellow-passengers\\non the coach.\\n\\nThe bus, rather early, rattled in with three passengers somewhat\\nbefore eight, and an evil-looking fellow on the sidewalk muttered a\\nfew indistinguishable words to the driver. I was, it appeared, in very\\nbad luck. There had been something wrong with the engine, despite the\\nexcellent time made from Newburyport, and the bus could not complete\\nthe journey to Arkham. No, it could not possibly be repaired that\\nnight, nor was there any other way of getting transportation out of\\nInnsmouth, either to Arkham or elsewhere. Sargent was sorry, but I\\nwould have to stop over at the Gilman. Probably the clerk would make\\nthe price easy for me, but there was nothing else to do. Almost dazed\\nby this sudden obstacle, and violently dreading the fall of night in\\nthis decaying and half-unlighted town, I left the bus and reentered\\nthe hotel lobby; where the sullen, queer-looking night clerk told me I\\ncould have Room 428 on next the top floorâ\\x80\\x94large, but without running\\nwaterâ\\x80\\x94for a dollar.\\n\\nDespite what I had heard of this hotel in Newburyport, I signed the\\nregister, paid my dollar, let the clerk take my valise, and followed\\nthat sour, solitary attendant up three creaking flights of stairs past\\ndusty corridors which seemed wholly devoid of life. My room, a dismal\\nrear one with two windows and bare, cheap furnishings, over-looked\\na dingy courtyard otherwise hemmed in by low, deserted brick blocks,\\nand commanded a view of decrepit westward-stretching roofs with a\\nmarshy countryside beyond. At the end of the corridor was a bathroomâ\\x80\\x94a\\ndiscouraging relique with ancient marble bowl, tin tub, faint electric\\nlight, and musty wooden panelling around all the plumbing fixtures.\\n\\nAs twilight deepened I turned on the one feeble electric bulb over the\\ncheap, iron-framed bed, and tried as best I could to read. I felt it\\nadvisable to keep my mind wholesomely occupied, for it would not do\\nto brood over the abnormalities of this ancient, blight-shadowed town\\nwhile I was still within its borders. The insane yarn I had heard from\\nthe aged drunkard did not promise very pleasant dreams, and I felt I\\nmust keep the image of his wild, watery eyes as far as possible from my\\nimagination.\\n\\nAnother thing that disturbed me was the absence of a bolt on the door\\nof my room. One had been there, as marks clearly showed, but there\\nwere signs of recent removal. No doubt it had become out of order,\\nlike so many other things in this decrepit edifice. In my nervousness\\nI looked around and discovered a bolt on the clothespress which seemed\\nto be of the same size, judging from the marks, as the one formerly on\\nthe door. To gain a partial relief from the general tension I busied\\nmyself by transferring this hardware to the vacant place with the aid\\nof a handy three-in-one device including a screw-driver which I kept\\non my keyring. The bolt fitted perfectly, and I was somewhat relieved\\nwhen I knew that I could shoot it firmly upon retiring. There were\\nadequate bolts on the two lateral doors to connecting rooms, and these\\nI proceeded to fasten.\\n\\nI did not undress, but decided to read till I was sleepy and then\\nlie down with only my coat, collar, and shoes off. Taking a pocket\\nflashlight from my valise, I placed it in my trousers, so that I\\ncould read my watch if I woke up later in the dark. Drowsiness,\\nhowever, did not come; and when I stopped to analyze my thoughts I\\nfound to my disquiet that I was really unconsciously listening for\\nsomethingâ\\x80\\x94listening for something which I dreaded but could not name.\\n\\nAt length, feeling a fatigue which had nothing of drowsiness in it, I\\nbolted the newly outfitted hall door, turned off the light, and threw\\nmyself down on the hard, uneven bedâ\\x80\\x94coat, collar, shoes, and all. In\\nthe darkness every faint noise of the night seemed magnified, and a\\nflood of doubly unpleasant thoughts swept over me. I was sorry I had\\nput out the light, yet was too tired to rise and turn it on again.\\nThen, after a long, dreary interval, and prefaced by a fresh creaking\\nof stairs and corridor, there came that soft, damnably unmistakable\\nsound which seemed like a malign fulfilment of all my apprehensions.\\nWithout the least shadow of a doubt, the lock on my hall door was being\\ntriedâ\\x80\\x94cautiously, furtively, tentativelyâ\\x80\\x94with a key.\\n\\nThe change in the menace from vague premonition to immediate reality\\nwas a profound shock, and fell upon me with the force of a genuine\\nblow. It never once occurred to me that the fumbling might be a mere\\nmistake. Malign purpose was all I could think of, and I kept deathly\\nquiet, awaiting the would-be intruder\\'s next move.\\n\\nAfter a time the cautious rattling ceased, and I heard the room to the\\nnorth entered with a pass key. Then the lock of the connecting door to\\nmy room was softly tried. The bolt held, of course, and I heard the\\nfloor creak as the prowler left the room. After a moment there came\\nanother soft rattling, and I knew that the room to the south of me was\\nbeing entered. Again a furtive trying of a bolted connecting door,\\nand again a receding creaking. This time the creaking went along the\\nhall and down the stairs, so I knew that the prowler had realized the\\nbolted condition of my doors and was giving up his attempt for a time.\\n\\nThe one thing to do was to get out of that hotel alive as quickly as I\\ncould, and through some channel other than the front stairs and lobby!\\n\\nRising softly and throwing my flashlight on the switch, I sought\\nto light the bulb over my bed in order to choose and pocket some\\nbelongings for a swift, valiseless flight. Nothing, however, happened;\\nand I saw that the power had been cut off. So, filling my pockets\\nwith the flashlight\\'s aid, I put on my hat and tiptoed to the\\nwindows to consider chances of descent. Despite the state\\'s safety\\nregulations there was no fire escape on this side of the hotel, and\\nI saw that my windows commanded only a sheer three-story drop to the\\ncobbled courtyard. On the right and left, however, some ancient brick\\nbusiness blocks abutted on the hotel; their slant roofs coming up to a\\nreasonable jumping distance from my fourth-story level. To reach either\\nof these lines of buildings I would have to be in a room two doors\\nfrom my ownâ\\x80\\x94in one case on the north and in the other case on the\\nsouthâ\\x80\\x94and my mind instantly set to work calculating what chances I had\\nof making the transfer.\\n\\nFirst, I reinforced my own outer door by pushing the bureau against\\nitâ\\x80\\x94little by little, in order to make a minimum of sound. Then,\\ngathering from the grocery boy\\'s map that the best route out of town\\nwas southward, I glanced first at the connecting door on the south\\nside of the room. It was designed to open in my direction, hence I\\nsawâ\\x80\\x94after drawing the bolt and finding other fastenings in placeâ\\x80\\x94it\\nwas not a favorable one for forcing. Accordingly abandoning it as a\\nroute, I cautiously moved the bedstead against it to hamper any attack\\nwhich might be made on it later from the next room. The door on the\\nnorth was hung to open away from me, and thisâ\\x80\\x94though a test proved\\nit to be locked or bolted from the other sideâ\\x80\\x94I knew must be my\\nroute. If I could gain the roofs of the buildings in Paine Street and\\ndescend successfully to the ground level, I might perhaps dart through\\nthe courtyard and the adjacent or opposite buildings to Washington\\nor Batesâ\\x80\\x94or else emerge in Paine and edge around southward into\\nWashington. In any case, I would aim to strike Washington somehow and\\nget quickly out of the Town Square region. My preference would be to\\navoid Paine, since the fire station there might be open all night.\\n\\nI was irresolutely speculating on when I had better attack the\\nnorthward door, and on how I could least audibly manage it, when I\\nnoticed that the vague noises underfoot had given place to a fresh and\\nheavier creaking of the stairs. A wavering flicker of light showed\\nthrough my transom, and the boards of the corridor began to groan with\\na ponderous load. Muffled sounds of possible vocal origin approached,\\nand at length a firm knock came at my outer door.\\n\\nFor a moment I simply held my breath and waited. Eternities\\nseemed to elapse, and the nauseous fishy odor of my environment\\nseemed to mount suddenly and spectacularly. Then the knocking was\\nrepeatedâ\\x80\\x94continuously, and with growing insistence. I knew that the\\ntime for action had come, and forthwith drew the bolt of the northward\\nconnecting door, bracing myself for the task of battering it open. The\\nknocking waxed louder, and I hoped that its volume would cover the\\nsound of my efforts. At last beginning my attempt, I lunged again and\\nagain at the thin panelling with my left shoulder, heedless of shock or\\npain.\\n\\nFinally the connecting door gave, but with such a crash that I knew\\nthose outside must have heard. Instantly the outside knocking became\\na violent battering, while keys sounded ominously in the hall doors\\nof the rooms on both sides of me. Rushing through the newly opened\\nconnection, I succeeded in bolting the northerly hall door before the\\nlock could be turned; but even as I did so I heard the hall door of the\\nthird roomâ\\x80\\x94the one from whose window I had hoped to reach the roof\\nbelowâ\\x80\\x94being tried with a pass key.\\n\\nFor an instant I felt absolute despair, since my trapping in a chamber\\nwith no window egress seemed complete. Then, with a dazed automatism,\\nI made for the next connecting door and performed the blind motion of\\npushing at it in an effort to get through!\\n\\nSheer fortunate chance gave me my reprieveâ\\x80\\x94for the connecting door\\nbefore me was not only unlocked but actually ajar. In a second I was\\nthrough, and had my right knee and shoulder against a hall door which\\nwas visibly opening inward. My pressure took the opener off guard, for\\nthe thing shut as I pushed, so that I could slip the well-conditioned\\nbolt as I had done with the other door. As I gained this respite I\\nheard the battering at the two other doors abate, while a confused\\nclatter came from the connecting door I had shielded with the bedstead.\\nEvidently the bulk of my assailants had entered the southerly room and\\nwere massing in a lateral attack. But at the same moment a pass key\\nsounded in the next door to the north, and I knew that a nearer peril\\nwas at hand.\\n\\nThe northward connecting door was wide open, but there was no time to\\nthink about checking the already turning lock in the hall. All I could\\ndo was to shut and bolt the open connecting door, as well as its mate\\non the opposite sideâ\\x80\\x94pushing a bedstead against the one and a bureau\\nagainst the other, and moving a washstand in front of the hall door.\\nI must, I saw, trust to such makeshift barriers to shield me till I\\ncould get out the window and on the roof of the Paine Street block. But\\neven in this acute moment my chief horror was something apart from the\\nimmediate weakness of my defenses. I was shuddering because not one\\nof my pursuers, despite some hideous pantings, gruntings, and subdued\\nbarkings at odd intervals, was uttering an intelligible vocal sound!\\n\\nAs I moved the furniture and rushed toward the windows I heard a\\nfrightful scurrying along the corridor toward the room north of me, and\\nperceived that the southward battering had ceased. Plainly, most of my\\nopponents were about to concentrate against the feeble connecting door\\nwhich they knew must open directly on me. Outside, the moon played on\\nthe ridge-pole of the block below, and I saw that the jump would be\\ndesperately hazardous because of the steep surface on which I must land.\\n\\nThe clatter at the northerly connecting door was now terrific, and\\nI saw that the weak panelling was beginning to splinter. Obviously,\\nthe besiegers had brought some ponderous object into play as a\\nbattering-ram. The bedstead, however, still held firm; so that I had at\\nleast a faint chance of making good my escape. As I opened the window\\nI noticed that it was flanked by heavy velour draperies suspended from\\na pole by brass rings, and also that there was a large projecting\\ncatch for the shutters on the exterior. Seeing a possible means of\\navoiding the dangerous jump, I yanked at the hangings and brought\\nthem down, pole and all; then quickly hooking two of the rings in the\\nshutter catch and flinging the drapery outside. The heavy folds reached\\nfully to the abutting roof, and I saw that the rings and catch would\\nbe likely to bear my weight. So, climbing out of the window and down\\nthe improvised rope ladder, I left behind me forever the morbid and\\nhorror-infested fabric of the Gilman House.\\n\\nI landed safely on the loose slates of the steep roof, and succeeded in\\ngaining the gaping black skylight without a slip. The place inside was\\nghoulish-looking, but I was past minding such impressions and made at\\nonce for the staircase revealed by my flashlightâ\\x80\\x94after a hasty glance\\nat my watch, which showed the hour to be 2 A.M. The steps creaked, but\\nseemed tolerably sound; and I raced down past a barnlike second story\\nto the ground floor. The desolation was complete, and only echoes\\nanswered my footfalls.\\n\\nThe hallway inside was black, and when I reached the opposite end I saw\\nthat the street door was wedged immovably shut. Resolved to try another\\nbuilding, I groped my way toward the courtyard, but stopped short when\\nclose to the doorway.\\n\\nFor out of an opened door in the Gilman House a large crowd of doubtful\\nshapes was pouringâ\\x80\\x94lanterns bobbing in the darkness, and horrible\\ncroaking voices exchanging low cries in what was certainly not English.\\nTheir features were indistinguishable, but their crouching, shambling\\ngait was abominably repellent. And worst of all, I perceived that one\\nfigure was strangely robed, and unmistakably surmounted by a tall tiara\\nof a design altogether too familiar. Again groping toward the street,\\nI opened a door off the hall and came upon an empty room with closely\\nshuttered but sashless windows. Fumbling in the rays of my flashlight,\\nI found I could open the shutters; and in another moment had climbed\\noutside and was carefully closing the aperture in its original manner.\\n\\nI walked rapidly, softly, and close to the ruined houses. At Bates\\nStreet I drew into a yawning vestibule while two shambling figures\\ncrossed in front of me, but was soon on my way again and approaching\\nthe open space where Eliot Street obliquely crosses Washington at the\\nintersection of South. Though I had never seen this space, it had\\nlooked dangerous to me on the grocery youth\\'s map; since the moonlight\\nwould have free play there. There was no use trying to evade it, for\\nany alternative course would involve detours of possibly disastrous\\nvisibility and delaying effect. The only thing to do was to cross it\\nboldly and openly; imitating the typical shamble of the Innsmouth folk\\nas best I could, and trusting that no oneâ\\x80\\x94or at least no pursuer of\\nmineâ\\x80\\x94would be there.\\n\\nJust how fully the pursuit was organizedâ\\x80\\x94and indeed, just what its\\npurpose might beâ\\x80\\x94I could form no idea. There seemed to be unusual\\nactivity in the town, but I judged that the news of my escape from\\nthe Gilman had not yet spread. The open space was, as I had expected,\\nstrongly moonlit. But my progress was unimpeded, and no fresh sound\\narose to hint that I had been spied. Glancing about me, I involuntarily\\nlet my pace slacken for a second to take in the sight of the sea,\\ngorgeous in the burning moonlight at the street\\'s end. Far out beyond\\nthe breakwater was the dim, dark line of Devil Reef.\\n\\nThen, without warning, I saw the intermittent flashes of light on the\\ndistant reef. My muscles tightened for panic flight, held in only by a\\ncertain unconscious caution and half-hypnotic fascination. And to make\\nmatters worse, there now flashed forth from the lofty cupola of the\\nGilman House, which loomed up to the northeast behind me, a series of\\nanalogous though differently spaced gleams which could be nothing less\\nthan an answering signal.\\n\\nI now bent to the left around the ruinous green; still gazing toward\\nthe ocean as it blazed in the spectral summer moonlight, and watching\\nthe cryptical flashing of those nameless, unexplainable beacons.\\n\\nIt was then that the most horrible impression of all was borne in upon\\nmeâ\\x80\\x94the impression which destroyed my last vestige of self-control and\\nsent me running frantically southward past the yawning black doorways\\nand fishily staring windows of that deserted nightmare street. For at\\na closer glance I saw that the moonlit waters between the reef and\\nthe shore were far from empty. They were alive with a teeming horde of\\nshapes swimming inward toward the town!\\n\\nMy frantic running ceased before I had covered a block, for at my left\\nI began to hear something like the hue and cry of organized pursuit.\\nThere were footsteps and guttural sounds, and a rattling motor wheezed\\nsouth along Federal Street. In a second all my plans were utterly\\nchangedâ\\x80\\x94for if the southward highway were blocked ahead of me, I must\\nclearly find another egress from Innsmouth. I paused and drew into a\\ngaping doorway, reflecting how lucky I was to have left the moonlit\\nopen space before these pursuers came down the parallel street.\\n\\nThen I thought of the abandoned railway to Rowley, whose solid line of\\nballasted, weed-grown earth still stretched off to the northwest from\\nthe crumbling station on the edge of the river gorge. There was just a\\nchance that the townsfolk would not think of that!\\n\\nDrawing inside the hall of my deserted shelter, I once more consulted\\nthe grocery boy\\'s map with the aid of the flashlight. The immediate\\nproblem was how to reach the ancient railway; and I now saw that the\\nsafest course was ahead to Babson Street, then west to Lafayetteâ\\x80\\x94there\\nedging around but not crossing an open space homologous to the one\\nI had traversedâ\\x80\\x94and subsequently back northward and westward in\\nzigzagging line through Lafayette, Bates, Adams, and Banks Streetsâ\\x80\\x94the\\nlatter skirting the river gorgeâ\\x80\\x94to the abandoned and dilapidated\\nstation I had seen from my window. My reason for going ahead to Babson\\nwas that I wished neither to re-cross the earlier open space nor to\\nbegin my westward course along a cross street as broad as South. I\\ncrossed the street to the right-hand side in order to edge around into\\nBabson as inconspicuously as possible.\\n\\nIn Babson Street I clung as closely as possible to the sagging,\\nuneven buildings; twice pausing in a doorway as the noises behind me\\nmomentarily increased. The open space ahead shone wide and desolate\\nunder the moon, but my route would not force me to cross it. During\\nmy second pause I began to detect a fresh distribution of the vague\\nsounds; and upon looking cautiously out from cover beheld a motor car\\ndarting across the open space, bound outward along Eliot Street.\\n\\nAs I watchedâ\\x80\\x94choked by a sudden rise in the fishy odor after a short\\nabatementâ\\x80\\x94I saw a band of uncouth, crouching shapes loping and\\nshambling in the same direction; and knew that this must be the party\\nguarding the Ipswich road, since that highway forms an extension of\\nEliot Street. Two of the figures I glimpsed were in voluminous robes,\\nand one wore a peaked diadem which glistened whitely in the moonlight.\\nThe gait of this figure was so odd that it sent a chill through meâ\\x80\\x94for\\nit seemed to me the creature was almost hopping .\\n\\nWhen the last of the band was out of sight I resumed my progress;\\ndarting around the corner into Lafayette Street, and crossing Eliot\\nvery hurriedly lest stragglers of the party be still advancing along\\nthat thoroughfare. I did hear some croaking and clattering sounds\\nfar off toward Town Square, but accomplished the passage without\\ndisaster. My greatest dread was in re-crossing broad and moonlit South\\nStreetâ\\x80\\x94with its seaward viewâ\\x80\\x94and I had to nerve myself for the\\nordeal. Someone might easily be looking, and possible Eliot Street\\nstragglers could not fail to glimpse me from either of two points. At\\nthe last moment I decided I had better slacken my trot and make the\\ncrossing as before in the shambling gait of an average Innsmouth native.\\n\\nI had not quite crossed the street when I heard a muttering band\\nadvancing along Washington from the north. As they reached the broad\\nopen space where I had had my first disquieting glimpse of the moonlit\\nwater I could see them plainly only a block awayâ\\x80\\x94and was horrified by\\nthe bestial abnormality of their faces and the dog-like sub-humanness\\nof their crouching gait. One man moved in a positively simian way, with\\nlong arms frequently touching the ground; while another figureâ\\x80\\x94robed\\nand tiaraedâ\\x80\\x94seemed to progress in an almost hopping fashion. I judged\\nthis party to be the one I had seen in the Gilman\\'s courtyardâ\\x80\\x94the one,\\ntherefore, most closely on my trail. As some of the figures turned\\nto look in my direction I was transfixed with fright, yet managed to\\npreserve the casual, shambling gait I had assumed. To this day I do\\nnot know whether they saw me or not. If they did, my stratagem must\\nhave deceived them, for they passed on across the moonlit space without\\nvarying their courseâ\\x80\\x94meanwhile croaking and jabbering in some hateful\\nguttural patois I could not identify.\\n\\nOnce more in shadow, I resumed my former dog-trot past the leaning and\\ndecrepit houses that stared blankly into the night. Having crossed to\\nthe western sidewalk I rounded the nearest corner into Bates Street,\\nwhere I kept close to the buildings on the southern side. At last I saw\\nthe ancient arcaded stationâ\\x80\\x94or what was left of itâ\\x80\\x94and made directly\\nfor the tracks that started from its farther end.\\n\\nThe rails were rusty but mainly intact, and not more than half the\\nties had rotted away. Walking or running on such a surface was very\\ndifficult; but I did my best, and on the whole made very fair time. For\\nsome distance the line kept on along the gorge\\'s brink, but at length I\\nreached the long covered bridge where it crossed the chasm at a dizzy\\nheight. The condition of this bridge would determine my next step. If\\nhumanly possible, I would use it; if not, I would have to risk more\\nstreet wandering and take the nearest intact highway bridge.\\n\\nThe vast, barnlike length of the old bridge gleamed spectrally in the\\nmoonlight and I saw that the ties were safe for at least a few feet\\nwithin. Entering, I began to use my flashlight, and was almost knocked\\ndown by the cloud of bats that flapped past me. About halfway across\\nthere was a perilous gap in the ties which I feared for a moment would\\nhalt me; but in the end I risked a desperate jump which fortunately\\nsucceeded.\\n\\nI was glad to see the moonlight again when I emerged from that macabre\\ntunnel. The old tracks crossed River Street at a grade, and at once\\nveered off into a region increasingly rural and with less and less of\\nInnsmouth\\'s abhorrent fishy odor. Here the dense growth of weeds and\\nbriers hindered me and cruelly tore my clothes, but I was none the less\\nglad that they were there to give me concealment in case of peril. I\\nknew that much of my route must be visible from the Rowley road.\\n\\nThe marshy region began very shortly, with the single track on a low,\\ngrassy embankment. Then came a sort of island of higher ground, where\\nthe line passed through a shallow open cut choked with bushes and\\nbrambles. I was very glad of this partial shelter, since at this point\\nthe Rowley road was uncomfortably near according to my window view.\\n\\nJust before entering the cut I glanced behind me, but saw no pursuer.\\nThe ancient spires and roofs of decaying Innsmouth gleamed lovely and\\nethereal in the magic yellow moonlight, and I thought of how they must\\nhave looked in the old days before the shadow fell. Then, as my gaze\\ncircled inland from the town, something less tranquil arrested my\\nnotice and held me immobile for a second.\\n\\nWhat I sawâ\\x80\\x94or fancied I sawâ\\x80\\x94was a disturbing suggestion of undulant\\nmotion far to the south; a suggestion which made me conclude that\\na very large horde must be pouring out of the city along the level\\nIpswich road. The distance was great, and I could distinguish nothing\\nin detail; but I did not at all like the look of that moving column.\\n\\nAll sorts of unpleasant conjectures crossed my mind. I thought of those\\nvery extreme Innsmouth types said to be hidden in crumbling, centuried\\nwarrens near the waterfront. I thought, too, of those nameless swimmers\\nI had seen. Counting the parties so far glimpsed, as well as those\\npresumably covering other roads, the number of my pursuers must be\\nstrangely large for a town as depopulated as Innsmouth.\\n\\nWho were they? Why were they here? And if such a column of them was\\nscouring the Ipswich road, would the patrols on the other roads be\\nlikewise augmented?\\n\\nI had entered the brush-grown cut and was struggling along at a very\\nslow pace when that damnable fishy odor again waxed dominant. There\\nwere sounds, tooâ\\x80\\x94a kind of wholesale, colossal flopping or pattering\\nwhich somehow called up images of the most detestable sort.\\n\\nAnd then both stench and sounds grew stronger, so that I paused\\nshivering and grateful for the cut\\'s protection. It was here, I\\nrecalled, that the Rowley road drew so close to the old railway before\\ncrossing westward and diverging. Something was coming along that road,\\nand I must lie low till its passage and vanishment in the distance.\\nCrouched in the bushes of that sandy cleft I felt reasonably safe, even\\nthough I knew the searchers would have to cross the track in front of\\nme not much more than a hundred yards away. I would be able to see\\nthem, but they could not, except by a malign miracle, see me.\\n\\nAll at once I began dreading to look at them as they passed. I saw the\\nclose moonlit space where they would surge by, and had curious thoughts\\nabout the irredeemable pollution of that space. They would perhaps\\nbe the worst of all Innsmouth typesâ\\x80\\x94something one would not care to\\nremember.\\n\\nThe stench waxed overpowering, and the noises swelled to a bestial\\nbabel of croaking, baying, and barking, without the least suggestion\\nof human speech. Were these indeed the voices of my pursuers? That\\nflopping or pattering was monstrousâ\\x80\\x94I could not look upon the\\ndegenerate creatures responsible for it. I would keep my eyes shut till\\nthe sounds receded toward the west. The horde was very close nowâ\\x80\\x94the\\nair foul with their hoarse snarlings, and the ground almost shaking\\nwith their alien-rhythmed footfalls. My breath nearly ceased to come,\\nand I put every ounce of will-power into the task of holding my eyelids\\ndown.\\n\\nI am not even yet willing to say whether what followed was a hideous\\nactuality or only a nightmare hallucination. The later action of the\\ngovernment, after my frantic appeals, would tend to confirm it as a\\nmonstrous truth; but could not an hallucination have been repeated\\nunder the quasi-hypnotic spell of that ancient, haunted, and shadowed\\ntown?\\n\\nBut I must try to tell what I thought I saw that night under the\\nmocking yellow moonâ\\x80\\x94saw surging and hopping down the Rowley road in\\nplain sight in front of me as I crouched among the wild brambles of\\nthat desolate railway cut. Of course my resolution to keep my eyes shut\\nhad failed. It was foredoomed to failureâ\\x80\\x94for who could crouch blindly\\nwhile a legion of croaking, baying entities of unknown source flopped\\nnoisomely past, scarcely more than a hundred yards away?\\n\\nFor I knew that a long section of them must be plainly in sight where\\nthe sides of the cut flattened out and the road crossed the trackâ\\x80\\x94and\\nI could no longer keep myself from sampling whatever horror that\\nleering yellow moon might have to show.\\n\\nIt was the end, for whatever remains to me of life on the surface of\\nthis earth, of every vestige of mental peace and confidence in the\\nintegrity of nature and of the human mind. Can it be possible that this\\nplanet has actually spawned such things; that human eyes have truly\\nseen, as objective flesh, what man has hitherto known only in febrile\\nphantasy and tenuous legend?\\n\\nAnd yet I saw them in a limitless streamâ\\x80\\x94flopping, hopping, croaking,\\nbleatingâ\\x80\\x94surging inhumanly through the spectral moonlight in a\\ngrotesque, malignant saraband of fantastic nightmare. And some of them\\nhad tall tiaras of that nameless whitish-gold metal ... and some were\\nstrangely robed ... and one, who led the way, was clad in a ghoulishly\\nhumped black coat and striped trousers, and had a man\\'s felt hat\\nperched on the shapeless thing that answered for a head....\\n\\nI think their predominant color was a grayish-green, though they had\\nwhite bellies. They were mostly shiny and slippery, but the ridges of\\ntheir backs were scaly. Their forms vaguely suggested the anthropoid,\\nwhile their heads were the heads of fish, with prodigious bulging eyes\\nthat never closed. At the sides of their necks were palpitating gills,\\nand their long paws were webbed. They hopped irregularly, sometimes on\\ntwo legs and sometimes on four. I was somehow glad that they had no\\nmore than four limbs. Their croaking, baying voices, clearly used for\\narticulate speech, held all the dark shades of expression which their\\nstaring faces lacked.\\n\\nBut for all of their monstrousness they were not unfamiliar to me. I\\nknew too well what they must beâ\\x80\\x94for was not the memory of that evil\\ntiara at Newburyport still fresh? They were the blasphemous fish-frogs\\nof the nameless designâ\\x80\\x94living and horribleâ\\x80\\x94and as I saw them I knew\\nalso of what that humped, tiaraed priest in the black church basement\\nhad so fearsomely reminded me. Their number was past guessing. It\\nseemed to me that there were limitless swarms of themâ\\x80\\x94and certainly my\\nmomentary glimpse could have shown only the least fraction. In another\\ninstant everything was blotted out by a merciful fit of fainting; the\\nfirst I had ever had.\\n\\nV\\n\\nIt was a gentle daylight rain that awaked me from my stupor in the\\nbrush-grown railway cut, and when I staggered out to the roadway ahead\\nI saw no trace of any prints in the fresh mud. Innsmouth\\'s ruined roofs\\nand toppling steeples loomed up grayly toward the southeast, but not a\\nliving creature did I spy in all the desolate salt marshes around. My\\nwatch was still going, and told me that the hour was past noon.\\n\\nThe reality of what I had been through was highly uncertain in my mind,\\nbut I felt that something hideous lay in the background. I must get\\naway from evil-shadowed Innsmouthâ\\x80\\x94and accordingly I began to test\\nmy cramped, wearied powers of locomotion. Despite weakness, hunger,\\nhorror, and bewilderment I found myself after a time able to walk; so\\nstarted slowly along the muddy road to Rowley. Before evening I was\\nin the village, getting a meal and providing myself with presentable\\nclothes. I caught the night train to Arkham, and the next day talked\\nlong and earnestly with government officials there; a process I later\\nrepeated in Boston. With the main result of these colloquies the public\\nis now familiarâ\\x80\\x94and I wish, for normality\\'s sake, there were nothing\\nmore to tell. Perhaps it is madness that is overtaking meâ\\x80\\x94yet perhaps\\na greater horrorâ\\x80\\x94or a greater marvelâ\\x80\\x94is reaching out.\\n\\nI dared not look for that piece of strange jewelry said to be in the\\nMiskatonic University Museum. I did, however, improve my stay in Arkham\\nby collecting some genealogical notes I had long wished to possess;\\nvery rough and hasty data, it is true, but capable of good use later\\non when I might have time to collate and codify them. The curator of\\nthe historical society thereâ\\x80\\x94Mr. E. Lapham Peabodyâ\\x80\\x94was very courteous\\nabout assisting me, and expressed unusual interest when I told him I\\nwas a grandson of Eliza Orne of Arkham, who was born in 1867 and had\\nmarried James Williamson of Ohio at the age of seventeen.\\n\\nIt seemed that a maternal uncle of mine had been there many years\\nbefore on a quest much like my own; and that my grandmother\\'s family\\nwas a topic of some local curiosity. There had, Mr. Peabody said, been\\nconsiderable discussion about the marriage of her father, Benjamin\\nOrne, just after the Civil War; since the ancestry of the bride was\\npeculiarly puzzling. That bride was understood to have been an orphaned\\nMarsh of New Hampshireâ\\x80\\x94a cousin of the Essex County Marshesâ\\x80\\x94but her\\neducation had been in France and she knew very little of her family. A\\nguardian had deposited funds in a Boston bank to maintain her and her\\nFrench governess; but that guardian\\'s name was unfamiliar to Arkham\\npeople, and in time he dropped out of sight, so that the governess\\nassumed his role by court appointment. The French-womanâ\\x80\\x94now long\\ndeadâ\\x80\\x94was very taciturn, and there were those who said she could have\\ntold more than she did.\\n\\nBut the most baffling thing was the inability of anyone to place\\nthe recorded parents of the young womanâ\\x80\\x94Enoch and Lydia (Meserve)\\nMarshâ\\x80\\x94among the known families of New Hampshire. Possibly,\\nmany suggested, she was the natural daughter of some Marsh of\\nprominenceâ\\x80\\x94she certainly had the true Marsh eyes. Most of the\\npuzzling was done after her early death, which took place at the birth\\nof my grandmotherâ\\x80\\x94her only child. Having formed some disagreeable\\nimpressions connected with the name of Marsh, I did not welcome the\\nnews that it belonged on my own ancestral tree; nor was I pleased\\nby Mr. Peabody\\'s suggestion that I had the true Marsh eyes myself.\\nHowever, I was grateful for data which I knew would prove valuable;\\nand took copious notes and lists of book references regarding the\\nwell-documented Orne family.\\n\\nI went directly home to Toledo from Boston, and later spent a month\\nat Maumee recuperating from my ordeal. In September I entered Oberlin\\nfor my final year, and from then till the next June was busy with\\nstudies and other wholesome activitiesâ\\x80\\x94reminded of the bygone terror\\nonly by occasional official visits from government men in connection\\nwith the campaign which my pleas and evidence had started. Around the\\nmiddle of Julyâ\\x80\\x94just a year after the Innsmouth experienceâ\\x80\\x94I spent a\\nweek with my late mother\\'s family in Cleveland; checking some of my\\nnew genealogical data with the various notes, traditions, and bits\\nof heirloom material in existence there, and seeing what kind of a\\nconnected chart I could construct.\\n\\nI did not exactly relish this task, for the atmosphere of the\\nWilliamson home had always depressed me. There was a strain of\\nmorbidity there, and my mother had never encouraged my visiting her\\nparents as a child, although she always welcomed her father when\\nhe came to Toledo. My Arkham-born grandmother had seemed strange\\nand almost terrifying to me, and I do not think I grieved when she\\ndisappeared. I was eight years old then, and it was said that she had\\nwandered off in grief after the suicide of my uncle Douglas, her eldest\\nson. He had shot himself after a trip to New Englandâ\\x80\\x94the same trip,\\nno doubt, which had caused him to be recalled at the Arkham Historical\\nSociety.\\n\\nThis uncle had resembled her, and I had never liked him either.\\nSomething about the staring, unwinking expression of both of them\\nhad given me a vague, unaccountable uneasiness. My mother and uncle\\nWalter had not looked like that. They were like their father, though\\npoor little cousin Lawrenceâ\\x80\\x94Walter\\'s sonâ\\x80\\x94had been an almost perfect\\nduplicate of his grandmother before his condition took him to the\\npermanent seclusion of a sanitarium at Canton. I had not seen him in\\nfour years, but my uncle once implied that his state, both mental and\\nphysical, was very bad. This worry had probably been a major cause of\\nhis mother\\'s death two years before.\\n\\nMy grandfather and his widowered son Walter now comprised the Cleveland\\nhousehold, but the memory of older times hung thickly over it. I still\\ndisliked the place, and tried to get my researches done as quickly as\\npossible. Williamson records and traditions were supplied in abundance\\nby my grandfather; though for Orne material I had to depend on my uncle\\nWalter, who put at my disposal the contents of all his files, including\\nnotes, letters, cuttings, heirlooms, photographs, and miniatures.\\n\\nIt was in going over the letters and pictures on the Orne side that I\\nbegan to acquire a kind of terror of my own ancestry. As I have said,\\nmy grandmother and uncle Douglas had always disturbed me. Now, years\\nafter their passing, I gazed at their pictured faces with a measurably\\nheightened feeling of repulsion and alienation. I could not at first\\nunderstand the change, but gradually a horrible sort of comparison began to obtrude itself on my unconscious mind despite the steady\\nrefusal of my consciousness to admit even the least suspicion of it.\\nIt was clear that the typical expression of these faces now suggested\\nsomething it had not suggested beforeâ\\x80\\x94something which would bring\\nstark panic if too openly thought of.\\n\\nBut the worst shock came when my uncle showed me the Orne jewelry in\\na downtown safe-deposit vault. Some of the items were delicate and\\ninspiring enough, but there was one box of strange old pieces descended\\nfrom my mysterious great-grandmother which my uncle was almost\\nreluctant to produce. They were, he said, of very grotesque and almost\\nrepulsive design.\\n\\nAs my uncle began slowly and grudgingly to unwrap the things, he urged\\nme not to be shocked by the strangeness and frequent hideousness of\\nthe designs. There were two armlets, a tiara, and a kind of pectoral;\\nthe latter having in high relief certain figures of almost unbearable\\nextravagance.\\n\\nHe seemed to expect some demonstration when the first pieceâ\\x80\\x94the\\ntiaraâ\\x80\\x94became visible, but I doubt if he expected quite what actually\\nhappened. I did not expect it, either, for I thought I was thoroughly\\nforewarned regarding what the jewelry would turn out to be. What I did\\nwas to faint silently away just as I had done in that brier-choked\\nrailway cut a year before.\\n\\nFrom that day on my life has been a nightmare of brooding and\\napprehension, nor do I know how much is hideous truth and how much\\nmadness. My great-grandmother had been a Marsh of unknown source whose\\nhusband lived in Arkhamâ\\x80\\x94and did not old Zadok say that the daughter of\\nObed Marsh by a monstrous mother was married to an Arkham man through\\na trick? What was it the ancient toper had muttered about the likeness\\nof my eyes to Captain Obed\\'s? In Arkham, too, the curator had told me I\\nhad the true Marsh eyes. Was Obed Marsh my own great-great-grandfather?\\nWhoâ\\x80\\x94or what â\\x80\\x94then, was my great-great-grandmother? But perhaps\\nthis was all madness. Those whitish-gold ornaments might easily\\nhave been bought from some Innsmouth sailor by the father of my\\ngreat-grandmother, whoever he was. And that look in the staring-eyed\\nfaces of my grandmother and self-slain uncle might be sheer fancy,\\nbolstered up by the Innsmouth shadow which had so darkly colored my\\nimagination. But why had my uncle killed himself after an ancestral\\nquest in New England?\\n\\nFor more than two years I fought off these reflections with partial\\nsuccess. My father secured me a place in an insurance office, and\\nI buried myself in routine as deeply as possible. In the winter of\\n1930-31, however, the dreams began. They were very sparse and insidious\\nat first, but increased in frequency and vividness as the weeks went\\nby. Great watery spaces opened out before me, and I seemed to wander\\nthrough titanic sunken porticos and labyrinths of weedy cyclopean walls\\nand grotesque fishes as my companions. Then the other shapes began to\\nappear, filling me with nameless horror the moment I awoke. But during\\nthe dreams they did not horrify me at allâ\\x80\\x94I was one with them; wearing\\ntheir unhuman trappings, treading their aqueous ways, and praying\\nmonstrously at their evil sea-bottom temples.\\n\\nThere was much more than I could remember, but even what I did remember\\neach morning would be enough to stamp me as a madman or a genius if\\never I dared write it down. Some frightful influence, I felt, was\\nseeking gradually to drag me out of the sane world of wholesome life\\ninto unnameable abysses of blackness and alienage; and the process\\ntold heavily on me. My health and appearance grew steadily worse, till\\nfinally I was forced to give up my position and adopt the static,\\nsecluded life of an invalid. Some odd nervous affliction had me in its\\ngrip, and I found myself at times almost unable to shut my eyes.\\n\\nIt was then that I began to study the mirror with mounting alarm. The\\nslow ravages of disease are not pleasant to watch, but in my case there\\nwas something subtler and more puzzling in the background. My father\\nseemed to notice it, too, for he began looking at me curiously and\\nalmost affrightedly. What was taking place in me? Could it be that I\\nwas coming to resemble my grandmother and uncle Douglas?\\n\\nOne night I had a frightful dream in which I met my grandmother\\nunder the sea. She lived in a phosphorescent palace of many\\nterraces, with gardens of strange leprous corals and grotesque\\nbrachiate efflorescences, and welcomed me with a warmth that may\\nhave been sardonic. She had changedâ\\x80\\x94as those who take to the water\\nchangeâ\\x80\\x94and told me she had never died. Instead, she had gone to a\\nspot her dead son had learned about, and had leaped to a realm whose\\nwondersâ\\x80\\x94destined for him as wellâ\\x80\\x94he had spurned with a smoking\\npistol. This was to be my realm, tooâ\\x80\\x94I could not escape it. I would\\nnever die, but would live with those who had lived since before man\\never walked the earth.\\n\\n\"One night, in a frightful dream, I met two Ancient Ones\\nunder the sea in a phosphorescent, many terraced palace surrounded by\\ngardens of strange, leprous corals.\"\\n\\nI met also that which had been her grandmother. For eighty thousand\\nyears Pth\\'thya-l\\'yi had lived in Y\\'ha-nthlei, and thither she had gone\\nback after Obed Marsh was dead. Y\\'ha-nthlei was not destroyed when\\nthe upper-earth men shot death into the sea. It was hurt, but not\\ndestroyed. The Deep Ones could never be destroyed, even though the\\npalaeogean magic of the forgotten Old Ones might sometimes check them.\\nFor the present they would rest; but some day, if they remembered, they\\nwould rise again for the tribute Great Cthulhu craved. It would be a\\ncity greater than Innsmouth next time. They had planned to spread, and\\nhad brought up that which would help them, but now they must wait once\\nmore. For bringing the upper-earth men\\'s death I must do a penance,\\nbut that would not be heavy. This was the dream in which I saw a shoggoth for the first time, and the sight set me awake in a frenzy\\nof screaming. That morning the mirror definitely told me I had acquired the Innsmouth look .\\n\\nSo far I have not shot myself as my uncle Douglas did. I bought an\\nautomatic and almost took the step, but certain dreams deterred me. The\\ntense extremes of horror are lessening, and I feel queerly drawn toward\\nthe unknown sea-deeps instead of fearing them. I hear and do strange\\nthings in sleep, and awake with a kind of exaltation instead of terror.\\nI do not believe I need to wait for the full change as most have\\nwaited. If I did, my father would probably shut me up in a sanitarium\\nas my poor little cousin is shut up. Stupendous and unheard-of\\nsplendors await me below, and I shall seek them soon. IÄ\\x81-R\\'lyeh!\\nCthulhu fhtagn! IÄ\\x81! IÄ\\x81! No, I shall not shoot myselfâ\\x80\\x94I cannot\\nbe made to shoot myself!\\n\\nI shall plan my cousin\\'s escape from that Canton madhouse, and together\\nwe shall go to marvel-shadowed Innsmouth. We shall swim out to that\\nbrooding reef in the sea and dive down through black abysses to\\ncyclopean and many-columned Y\\'ha-nthlei, and in that lair of the Deep\\nOnes we shall dwell amidst wonder and glory forever.',\n",

LOVECRAFT\\n\\nA tale of dark science, and the ghastly mystery that enveloped the Spanish doctor\\'s attempts at artificial refrigeration.\\n\\n[Transcriber\\'s Note: This etext was produced from Weird Tales September 1939. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\\n\\nYou ask me to explain why I am afraid of a draft of cool air; why I\\nshiver more than others upon entering a cold room, and seem nauseated\\nand repelled when the chill of evening creeps through the heat of a\\nmild autumn day. There are those who say I respond to cold as others do\\nto a bad odor, and I am the last to deny the impression. What I will\\ndo is to relate the most horrible circumstance I ever encountered,\\nand leave it to you to judge whether or not this forms a suitable\\nexplanation of my peculiarity.\\n\\nIt is a mistake to fancy that horror is associated inextricably\\nwith darkness, silence, and solitude. I found it in the glare of\\nmidafternoon, in the clangor of a metropolis, and in the teeming midst\\nof a shabby and commonplace rooming-house with a prosaic landlady\\nand two stalwart men by my side. In the spring of 1923 I had secured\\nsome dreary and unprofitable magazine work in the city of New York;\\nand being unable to pay any substantial rent, began drifting from one\\ncheap boarding establishment to another in search of a room which might\\ncombine the qualities of decent cleanliness, endurable furnishings,\\nand very reasonable price. It soon developed that I had only a choice\\nbetween different evils, but after a time I came upon a house in West\\nFourteenth Street which disgusted me much less than the others I had\\nsampled.\\n\\nThe place was a four-story mansion of brownstone, dating apparently\\nfrom the late forties, and fitted with woodwork and marble whose\\nstained and sullied splendor argued a descent from high levels of\\ntasteful opulence. In the rooms, large and lofty, and decorated with\\nimpossible paper and ridiculously ornate stucco cornices, there\\nlingered a depressing mustiness and hint of obscure cookery; but the\\nfloors were clean, the linen tolerably regular, and the hot water not\\ntoo often cold or turned off; so that I came to regard it as at least\\na bearable place to hibernate until one might really live again. The\\nlandlady, a slatternly, almost bearded Spanish woman named Herrero,\\ndid not annoy me with gossip or with criticisms of the late-burning\\nelectric light in my third floor front hall room; and my fellow-lodgers\\nwere as quiet and uncommunicative as one might desire, being mostly\\nSpaniards a little above the coarsest and crudest grade. Only the din\\nof street-cars in the thoroughfare below proved a serious annoyance.\\n\\nI had been there about three weeks when the first odd incident\\noccurred. One evening at about eight I heard a spattering on the floor\\nand became suddenly aware that I had been smelling the pungent odor of\\nammonia for some time. Looking about, I saw that the ceiling was wet\\nand dripping; the soaking apparently proceeding from a corner on the\\nside toward the street. Anxious to stop the matter at its source, I\\nhastened to the basement to tell the landlady, and was assured by her\\nthat the trouble would quickly be set right.\\n\\n\"Doctair MuÃ±oz,\" she cried as she rushed upstairs ahead of me, \"he have\\nspeel hees chemicals. He ees too seeck for doctair heemselfâ\\x80\\x94seecker\\nand seecker all the timeâ\\x80\\x94but he weel not have no othair for help. He\\nees vairy queer in hees seecknessâ\\x80\\x94all day he take funnee-smelling\\nbaths, and he cannot get excite or warm. All hees own housework he\\ndoâ\\x80\\x94hees leetle room are full of bottles and machines and he do not\\nwork as doctair. But he was great onceâ\\x80\\x94my fathair in Barcelona have\\nhear of heemâ\\x80\\x94and only joost now he feex a arm of the plumber that get\\nhurt of sudden. He nevair go out, only on roof, and my boy Esteban he\\nbreeng heem hees food and laundry and mediceens and chemicals. My God,\\nthe sal-ammoniac that man use for to keep heem cool!\"\\n\\nMrs. Herrero disappeared up the staircase to the fourth floor, and I\\nreturned to my room. The ammonia ceased to drip, and as I cleaned up\\nwhat had spilled and opened the window for air, I heard the landlady\\'s\\nheavy footsteps above me. Doctor MuÃ±oz I had never heard, save for\\ncertain sounds as of some gasoline-driven mechanism; since his step was\\nsoft and gentle. I wondered for a moment what the strange affliction\\nof this man might be, and whether his obstinate refusal of outside\\naid were not the result of a rather baseless eccentricity. There is,\\nI reflected tritely, an infinite deal of pathos in the state of an\\neminent person who has come down in the world.\\n\\nI might never have known Doctor MuÃ±oz had it not been for the heart\\nattack that suddenly seized me one forenoon as I sat writing in my\\nroom. Physicians had told me of the danger of those spells, and I knew\\nthere was no time to be lost; so, remembering what the landlady had\\nsaid about the invalid\\'s help of the injured workman, I dragged myself\\nupstairs and knocked feebly at the door above mine.\\n\\nMy knock was answered in good English by a curious voice some distance\\nto the right, asking my name and business; and these things being\\nstated, there came an opening of the door next to the one I had sought.\\n\\nA rush of cool air greeted me; and though the day was one of the\\nhottest of late June, I shivered as I crossed the threshold into a\\nlarge apartment whose rich and tasteful decoration surprized me in\\nthis nest of squalor and seediness. A folding couch now filled its\\ndiurnal rÃ´le of sofa, and the mahogany furniture, sumptuous hangings,\\nold paintings, and mellow bookshelves all bespoke a gentleman\\'s study\\nrather than a boarding-house bedroom. I now saw that the hall room\\nabove mineâ\\x80\\x94the \"leetle room\" of bottles and machines which Mrs.\\nHerrero had mentionedâ\\x80\\x94was merely the laboratory of the doctor; and\\nthat his main living-quarters lay in the spacious adjoining room whose\\nconvenient alcoves and large contiguous bathroom permitted him to hide\\nall dressers and obtrusively utilitarian devices. Doctor MuÃ±oz, most\\ncertainly, was a man of birth, cultivation, and discrimination.\\n\\nThe figure before me was short but exquisitely proportioned, and clad\\nin somewhat formal dress of perfect fit and cut. A high-bred face\\nof masterful though not arrogant expression was adorned by a short\\niron-gray full beard, and an old-fashioned pince-nez shielded the full,\\ndark eyes and surmounted an aquiline nose which gave a Moorish touch to\\na physiognomy otherwise dominantly Celt-Iberian. Thick, well-trimmed\\nhair that argued the punctual calls of a barber was parted gracefully\\nabove a high forehead; and the whole picture was one of striking\\nintelligence and superior blood and breeding.\\n\\nNevertheless, as I saw Doctor MuÃ±oz in that blast of cool air, I felt\\na repugnance which nothing in his aspect could justify. Only his\\nlividly inclined complexion and coldness of touch could have afforded\\na physical basis for this feeling, and even these things should have\\nbeen excusable considering the man\\'s known invalidism. It might, too,\\nhave been the singular cold that alienated me; for such chilliness was\\nabnormal on so hot a day, and the abnormal always excites aversion,\\ndistrust, and fear.\\n\\nBut repugnance was soon forgotten in admiration, for the strange\\nphysician\\'s extreme skill at once became manifest despite the\\nice-coldness and shakiness of his bloodless-looking hands. He clearly\\nunderstood my needs at a glance, and ministered to them with a master\\'s\\ndeftness; the while reassuring me in a finely modulated though oddly\\nhollow and timbreless voice that he was the bitterest of sworn\\nenemies to death, and had sunk his fortune and lost all his friends\\nin a lifetime of bizarre experiment devoted to its bafflement and\\nextirpation. Something of the benevolent fanatic seemed to reside in\\nhim, and he rambled on almost garrulously as he sounded my chest and\\nmixed a suitable draft of drugs fetched from the smaller laboratory\\nroom. Evidently he found the society of a well-born man a rare novelty\\nin this dingy environment, and was moved to unaccustomed speech as\\nmemories of better days surged over him.\\n\\nHis voice, if queer, was at least soothing; and I could not even\\nperceive that he breathed as the fluent sentences rolled urbanely\\nout. He sought to distract my mind from my own seizure by speaking of\\nhis theories and experiments; and I remember his tactfully consoling\\nme about my weak heart by insisting that will and consciousness are\\nstronger than organic life itself, so that if a bodily frame be\\nbut originally healthy and carefully preserved, it may through a\\nscientific enhancement of these qualities retain a kind of nervous\\nanimation despite the most serious impairments, defects, or even\\nabsences in the battery of specific organs. He might, he half-jestingly\\nsaid, some day teach me to liveâ\\x80\\x94or at least to possess some kind\\nof conscious existenceâ\\x80\\x94without any heart at all! For his part, he\\nwas afflicted with a complication of maladies requiring a very exact\\nregimen which included constant cold. Any marked rise in temperature\\nmight, if prolonged, affect him fatally; and the frigidity of his\\nhabitationâ\\x80\\x94some fifty-five or fifty-six degrees Fahrenheitâ\\x80\\x94was\\nmaintained by an absorption system of ammonia cooling, the gasoline\\nengine whose pumps I had often heard in my room below.\\n\\nRelieved of my seizure in a marvelously short while, I left the shivery\\nplace a disciple and devotee of the gifted recluse. After that I paid\\nhim frequent overcoated calls, listening while he told of secret\\nresearches and almost ghastly results, and trembling a bit when I\\nexamined the unconventional and astonishingly ancient volumes on his\\nshelves. I was eventually, I may add, almost cured of my disease for\\nall time by his skilful ministrations. It seems that he did not scorn\\nthe incantations of the mediÃ¦valists, since he believed these cryptic\\nformulÃ¦ to contain rare psychological stimuli which might conceivably\\nhave singular effects on the substance of a nervous system from which\\norganic pulsations had fled. I was touched by his account of the aged\\nDoctor Torres of Valencia, who had shared his earlier experiments\\nand nursed him through the great illness of eighteen years before,\\nwhence his present disorders proceeded. No sooner had the venerable\\npractitioner saved his colleague than he himself succumbed to the\\ngrim enemy he had fought. Perhaps the strain had been too great; for\\nDoctor MuÃ±oz made it whisperingly clearâ\\x80\\x94though not in detailâ\\x80\\x94that the\\nmethods of healing had been most extraordinary, involving scenes and\\nprocesses not welcomed by elderly and conservative Galens.\\n\\nAs the weeks passed, I observed with regret that my new friend\\nwas indeed slowly but unmistakably losing ground physically, as\\nMrs. Herrero had suggested. The livid aspect of his countenance\\nwas intensified, his voice became more hollow and indistinct, his\\nmuscular motions were less perfectly coÃ¶rdinated, and his mind and\\nwill displayed less resilience and initiative. Of this sad change\\nhe seemed by no means unaware, and little by little his expression\\nand conversation both took on a gruesome irony which restored in me\\nsomething of the subtle repulsion I had originally felt.\\n\\nHe developed strange caprices, acquiring a fondness for exotic\\nspices and Egyptian incense until his room smelled like the vault\\nof a sepulchered Pharaoh in the Valley of Kings. At the same time,\\nhis demands for cold air increased, and with my aid he amplified the\\nammonia piping of his room and modified the pumps and feed of his\\nrefrigerating machine until he could keep the temperature as low as\\nthirty-four or forty degrees, and finally even twenty-eight degrees;\\nthe bathroom and laboratory, of course, being less chilled, in order\\nthat water might not freeze, and that chemical processes might not\\nbe impeded. The tenant adjoining him complained of the icy air from\\naround the connecting door; so I helped him fit heavy hangings to\\nobviate the difficulty. A kind of growing horror, of outrÃ© and morbid\\ncast, seemed to possess him. He talked of death incessantly, but\\nlaughed hollowly when such things as burial or funeral arrangements\\nwere gently suggested.\\n\\nAll in all, he became a disconcerting and even gruesome companion; yet\\nin my gratitude for his healing, I could not well abandon him to the\\nstrangers around him, and was careful to dust his room and attend to\\nhis needs each day, muffled in a heavy ulster which I bought especially\\nfor the purpose. I likewise did much of his shopping, and gasped in\\nbafflement at some of the chemicals he ordered from druggists and\\nlaboratory supply houses.\\n\\nAn increasing and unexplained atmosphere of panic seemed to rise around\\nhis apartment. The whole house, as I have said, had a musty odor;\\nbut the smell in his room was worse, in spite of all the spices and\\nincense, and the pungent chemicals of the now incessant baths which he\\ninsisted on taking unaided. I perceived that it must be connected with\\nhis ailment, and shuddered when I reflected on what that ailment might\\nbe. Mrs. Herrero crossed herself when she looked at him, and gave him\\nup unreservedly to me; not even letting her son Esteban continue to\\nrun errands for him. When I suggested other physicians, the sufferer\\nwould fly into as much of a rage as he seemed to dare to entertain.\\nHe evidently feared the physical effect of violent emotion, yet his\\nwill and driving force waxed rather than waned, and he refused to be\\nconfined to his bed. The lassitude of his earlier ill days gave place\\nto a return of his fiery purpose, so that he seemed about to hurl\\ndefiance at the death-demon even as that ancient enemy seized him. The\\npretense of eating, always curiously like a formality with him, he\\nvirtually abandoned; and mental power alone appeared to keep him from\\ntotal collapse.\\n\\nHe acquired a habit of writing long documents of some sort, which he\\ncarefully sealed and filed with injunctions that I transmit them after\\nhis death to certain persons whom he namedâ\\x80\\x94for the most part lettered\\nEast Indians, but including also a once celebrated French physician\\nnow generally thought dead, and about whom the most inconceivable\\nthings had been whispered. As it happened, I burned all these papers\\nundelivered and unopened. His aspect and voice became utterly\\nfrightful, and his presence almost unbearable. One September day an\\nunexpected glimpse of him induced an epileptic fit in a man who had\\ncome to repair his electric desk lamp; a fit for which he prescribed\\neffectively while keeping himself well out of sight. That man, oddly\\nenough, had been through the terrors of the great war without having\\nincurred any fright so thorough.\\n\\nThen, in the middle of October, the horror of horrors came with\\nstupefying suddenness. One night about eleven the pump of the\\nrefrigerating machine broke down, so that within three hours the\\nprocess of ammonia cooling became impossible. Doctor MuÃ±oz summoned me\\nby thumping on the floor, and I worked desperately to repair the injury\\nwhile my host cursed in a tone whose lifeless, rattling hollowness\\nsurpassed description. My amateur efforts, however, proved of no use;\\nand when I had brought in a mechanic from a neighboring all-night\\ngarage we learned that nothing could be done until morning, when a\\nnew piston would have to be obtained. The moribund hermit\\'s rage and\\nfear, swelling to grotesque proportions, seemed likely to shatter what\\nremained of his failing physique; and once a spasm caused him to clap\\nhis hands to his eyes and rush into the bathroom. He groped his way\\nout with face tightly bandaged, and I never saw his eyes again.\\n\\n\"He groped his way out with face tightly bandaged, and I never saw his eyes again.\"\\n\\nThe frigidity of the apartment was now sensibly diminishing, and\\nat about five in the morning, the doctor retired to the bathroom,\\ncommanding me to keep him supplied with all the ice I could obtain\\nat all-night drugstores and cafeterias. As I would return from my\\nsometimes discouraging trips and lay my spoils before the closed\\nbathroom door, I could hear a restless splashing within, and a thick\\nvoice croaking out the order for \"Moreâ\\x80\\x94more!\" At length a warm day\\nbroke, and the shops opened one by one. I asked Esteban either to help\\nwith the ice-fetching while I obtained the pump piston, or to order the\\npiston while I continued with the ice; but, instructed by his mother,\\nhe absolutely refused.\\n\\nFinally I hired a seedy-looking loafer whom I encountered on the corner\\nof Eighth Avenue to keep the patient supplied with ice from a little\\nshop where I introduced him, and applied myself diligently to the task\\nof finding a pump piston and engaging workmen competent to install it.\\nThe task seemed interminable, and I raged almost as violently as the\\nhermit when I saw the hours slipping by in a breathless, foodless round\\nof vain telephoning, and a hectic quest from place to place, hither and\\nthither by subway and surface car.\\n\\nAbout noon I encountered a suitable supply house far downtown, and at\\napproximately one-thirty that afternoon arrived at my boarding-place\\nwith the necessary paraphernalia and two sturdy and intelligent\\nmechanics. I had done all I could, and hoped I was in time.\\n\\nBlack terror, however, had preceded me. The house was in utter turmoil,\\nand above the chatter of awed voices I heard a man praying in a deep\\nbasso. Fiendish things were in the air, and lodgers told over the\\nbeads of their rosaries as they caught the odor from beneath the\\ndoctor\\'s closed door. The lounger I had hired, it seems, had fled\\nscreaming and mad-eyed not long after his second delivery of ice:\\nperhaps as a result of excessive curiosity. He could not, of course,\\nhave locked the door behind him; yet it was now fastened, presumably\\nfrom the inside. There was no sound within save a nameless sort of\\nslow, thick dripping.\\n\\nBriefly consulting with Mrs. Herrero and the workmen despite a fear\\nthat gnawed my inmost soul, I advised the breaking down of the door;\\nbut the landlady found a way to turn the key from the outside with some\\nwire device. We had previously opened the doors of all the other rooms\\non that hall, and flung all the windows to the very top. Now, noses\\nprotected by handkerchiefs, we tremblingly invaded the accursed south\\nroom, which blazed with the warm sun of early afternoon.\\n\\nA kind of dark, slimy trail led from the open bathroom door to the\\nhall door, and thence to the desk, where a terrible little pool had\\naccumulated. Something was scrawled there in a pencil in an awful,\\nblind hand on a piece of paper hideously smeared as though by the very\\nclaws that traced the hurried last words. Then the trail led to the\\ncouch and ended unutterably.\\n\\nWhat was, or had been, on the couch I cannot and dare not say here. But\\nthis is what I shiveringly puzzled out on the stickily smeared paper\\nbefore I drew a match and burned it to a crisp; what I puzzled out\\nin terror as the landlady and two mechanics rushed frantically from\\nthat hellish place to babble their incoherent stories at the nearest\\npolice station. The nauseous words seemed well-nigh incredible in that\\nyellow sunlight, with the clatter of cars and motor trucks ascending\\nclamorously from crowded Fourteenth Street, yet I confess that I\\nbelieved them then. Whether I believe them now I honestly do not know.\\nThere are things about which it is better not to speculate, and all\\nthat I can say is that I hate the smell of ammonia, and grow faint at a\\ndraft of unusually cool air.\\n\\n\"The end,\" ran that noisome scrawl, \"is here. No more iceâ\\x80\\x94the man\\nlooked and ran away. Warmer every minute, and the tissues can\\'t last.\\nI fancy you knowâ\\x80\\x94what I said about the will and the nerves and the\\npreserved body after the organs ceased to work. It was good theory, but\\ncouldn\\'t keep up indefinitely. There was a gradual deterioration I had\\nnot foreseen. Doctor Torres knew, but the shock killed him. He couldn\\'t\\nstand what he had to do; he had to get me in a strange, dark place,\\nwhen he minded my letter and nursed me back. And the organs never would\\nwork again. It had to be done my wayâ\\x80\\x94artificial preservationâ\\x80\\x94 for you\\nsee I died that time eighteen years ago .\"',\n",

The Shadow on the Chimney\\n\\nThere was thunder in the air on the night I went to the deserted\\nmansion atop Tempest Mountain to find the lurking fear. I was not\\nalone, for foolhardiness was not then mixed with that love of the\\ngrotesque and the terrible which has made my career a series of quests\\nfor strange horrors in literature and in life. With me were two\\nfaithful and muscular men for whom I had sent when the time came; men\\nlong associated with me in my ghastly explorations because of their\\npeculiar fitness.\\n\\nWe had started quietly from the village because of the reporters who\\nstill lingered about after the eldritch panic of a month beforeâ\\x80\\x94the\\nnightmare creeping death. Later, I thought, they might aid me; but I\\ndid not want them then. Would to God I had let them share the search,\\nthat I might not have had to bear the secret alone so long; to bear\\nit alone for fear the world would call me mad or go mad itself at the\\ndemon implications of the thing. Now that I am telling it anyway, lest\\nthe brooding make me a maniac, I wish I had never concealed it. For\\nI, and I only, know what manner of fear lurked on that spectral and\\ndesolate mountain.\\n\\nIn a small motor-car we covered the miles of primeval forest and\\nhill until the wooded ascent checked it. The country bore an aspect\\nmore than usually sinister as we viewed it by night and without the\\naccustomed crowds of investigators, so that we were often tempted to\\nuse the acetylene headlights despite the attention it might attract.\\nIt was not a wholesome landscape after dark, and I believe I would\\nhave noticed its morbidity even had I been ignorant of the terror\\nthat stalked there. Of wild creatures there were noneâ\\x80\\x94they are wise\\nwhen death leers close. The ancient lightning-scarred trees seemed\\nunnaturally large and twisted, and the other vegetation unnaturally\\nthick and feverish, while curious mounds and hummocks in the weedy,\\nfulgurite-pitted earth reminded me of snakes and dead men\\'s skulls\\nswelled to gigantic proportions.\\n\\nFear had lurked on Tempest Mountain for more than a century. This I\\nlearned at once from newspaper accounts of the catastrophe which first\\nbrought the region to the world\\'s notice. The place is a remote, lonely\\nelevation in that part of the Catskills where Dutch civilization once\\nfeebly and transiently penetrated, leaving behind as it receded only\\na few ruined mansions and a degenerate squatter population inhabiting\\npitiful hamlets on isolated slopes. Normal beings seldom visited\\nthe locality till the state police were formed, and even now only\\ninfrequent troopers patrol it. The fear, however, is an old tradition\\nthroughout the neighboring villages; since it is a prime topic in the\\nsimple discourse of the poor mongrels who sometimes leave their valleys\\nto trade hand-woven baskets for such primitive necessities as they can\\nnot shoot, raise, or make.\\n\\nThe lurking fear dwelt in the shunned and deserted Martense mansion,\\nwhich crowned the high but gradual eminence whose liability to frequent\\nthunderstorms gave it the name of Tempest Mountain. For over a hundred\\nyears the antique, grove-circled stone house had been the subject\\nof stories incredibly wild and monstrously hideous; stories of a\\nsilent colossal creeping death which stalked abroad in summer. With\\nwhimpering insistence the squatters told tales of a demon which seized\\nlone wayfarers after dark, either carrying them off or leaving them\\nin a frightful state of gnawed dismemberment; while sometimes they\\nwhispered of blood-trails toward the distant mansion. Some said the\\nthunder called the lurking fear out of its habitation, while others\\nsaid the thunder was its voice.\\n\\nNo one outside the backwoods had believed these varying and conflicting\\nstories, with their incoherent, extravagant descriptions of the\\nhalf-glimpsed fiend; yet not a farmer or villager doubted that the\\nMartense mansion was ghoulishly haunted. Local history forbade\\nsuch a doubt, although no ghostly evidence was ever found by such\\ninvestigators as had visited the building after some especially vivid\\ntales of the squatters. Grandmothers told strange myths of the Martense\\nspecter; myths concerning the Martense family itself, its queer\\nhereditary dissimilarity of eyes, its long, unnatural annals, and the\\nmurder which had cursed it.\\n\\nThe terror which brought me to the scene was a sudden and portentous\\nconfirmation of the mountaineers\\' wildest legends. One summer night,\\nafter a thunderstorm of unprecedented violence, the countryside was\\naroused by a squatter stampede which no mere delusion could create. The\\npitiful throngs of natives shrieked and whined of the unnamable horror\\nwhich had descended upon them, and they were not doubted. They had not\\nseen it, but had heard such cries from one of their hamlets that they\\nknew a creeping death had come.\\n\\nIn the morning citizens and state troopers followed the shuddering\\nmountaineers to the place where they said the death had come. Death\\nwas indeed there. The ground under one of the squatters\\' villages\\nhad caved in after a lightning strike, destroying several of the\\nmalodorous shanties; but upon this property damage was superimposed an\\norganic devastation which paled it to insignificance. Of a possible\\nseventy-five natives who had inhabited this spot, not one living\\nspecimen was visible. The disordered earth was covered with blood and\\nhuman debris bespeaking too vividly the ravages of demon teeth and\\ntalons; yet no visible trail led away from the carnage. That some\\nhideous animal must be the cause, everyone quickly agreed; nor did any\\ntongue now revive the charge that such cryptic deaths formed merely the\\nsordid murders common in decadent communities. That charge was revived\\nonly when about twenty-five of the estimated population were found\\nmissing from the dead; and even then it was hard to explain the murder\\nof fifty by half that number. But the fact remained that on a summer\\nnight a bolt had come out of the heavens and left a dead village whose\\ncorpses were horribly mangled, chewed, and clawed.\\n\\nThe excited countryside immediately connected the horror with the\\nhaunted Martense mansion, though the localities were over three miles\\napart. The troopers were more skeptical, including the mansion only\\ncasually in their investigations, and dropping it altogether when they\\nfound it thoroughly deserted. Country and village people, however,\\ncanvassed the place with infinite care; overturning everything in the\\nhouse, sounding ponds and brooks, beating down bushes, and ransacking\\nthe near-by forests. All was in vain; the death that had come had left\\nno trace save destruction itself.\\n\\nBy the second day of the search the affair was fully treated by the\\nnewspapers, whose reporters overran Tempest Mountain. They described\\nit in much detail, and with many interviews to elucidate the horror\\'s\\nhistory as told by local grandams. I followed the accounts languidly\\nat first, for I am a connoisseur in horrors; but after a week I\\ndetected an atmosphere which stirred me oddly, so that on August\\n5th, 1921, I registered among the reporters who crowded the hotel at\\nLefferts Corners, nearest village to Tempest Mountain and acknowledged\\nheadquarters of the searchers. Three weeks more, and the dispersal of\\nthe reporters left me free to begin a terrible exploration based on the\\nminute inquiries and surveying with which I had meanwhile busied myself.\\n\\nSo on this summer night, while distant thunder rumbled, I left a silent\\nmotor-car and tramped with two armed companions up the mound-covered\\nreaches of Tempest Mountain, casting the beams of an electric torch on\\nthe spectral gray walls that began to appear through the giant oaks\\nahead. In this morbid night solitude and feeble shifting illumination,\\nthe vast boxlike pile displayed obscure hints of terror which day could\\nnot uncover; yet I did not hesitate, since I had come with fierce\\nresolution to test an idea. I believed that the thunder called the\\ndeath-demon out of some fearsome secret place; and be that demon solid\\nentity or vaporous pestilence, I meant to see it.\\n\\nI had thoroughly searched the ruin before, hence knew my plan well;\\nchoosing as the seat of my vigil the old room of Jan Martense, whose\\nmurder looms so great in the rural legends. I felt subtly that the\\napartment of this ancient victim was best for my purposes. The chamber,\\nmeasuring about twenty feet square, contained like the other rooms some\\nrubbish which had once been furniture. It lay on the second story, on\\nthe southeast corner of the house, and had an immense east window and\\nnarrow south window, both devoid of panes or shutters. Opposite the\\nlarge window was an enormous Dutch fireplace with scriptural tiles\\nrepresenting the prodigal son, and opposite the narrow window was a\\nspacious bed built into the wall.\\n\\nAs the tree-muffled thunder grew louder, I arranged my plan\\'s details.\\nFirst I fastened side by side on the ledge of the large window three\\nrope ladders which I had brought with me. I knew they reached a\\nsuitable spot on the grass outside, for I had tested them. Then the\\nthree of us dragged from another room a wide four-poster bedstead,\\ncrowding it laterally against the window. Having strewn it with fir\\nboughs, all now rested on it with drawn automatics, two relaxing while\\nthe third watched. From whatever direction the demon might come, our\\npotential escape was provided. If it came from within the house, we had\\nthe window ladders; if from outside, the door and the stairs. We did\\nnot think, judging from precedent, that it would pursue us far even at\\nworst.\\n\\nI watched from midnight to 1 o\\'clock, when in spite of the sinister\\nhouse, the unprotected window, and the approaching thunder and\\nlightning, I felt singularly drowsy. I was between my two companions.\\nGeorge Bennett being toward the window and William Tobey toward\\nthe fireplace. Bennett was asleep, having apparently felt the same\\nanomalous drowsiness which affected me, so I designated Tobey for the\\nnext watch although even he was nodding. It is curious how intently I\\nhad been watching that fireplace.\\n\\nThe increasing thunder must have affected my dreams, for in the brief\\ntime I slept there came to me apocalyptic visions. Once I partly\\nawaked, probably because the sleeper toward the window had restlessly\\nflung an arm across my chest. I was not sufficiently awake to see\\nwhether Tobey was attending to his duties as sentinel, but felt a\\ndistinct anxiety on that score. Never before had the presence of evil\\nso poignantly oppressed me. Later I must have dropped asleep again, for\\nit was out of a phantasmal chaos that my mind leaped when the night\\ngrew hideous with shrieks beyond anything in my former experience or\\nimagination.\\n\\nIn that shrieking the inmost soul of human fear and agony clawed\\nhopelessly and insanely at the ebony gates of oblivion. I awoke to\\nred madness and the mockery of diabolism, as farther and farther down\\ninconceivable vistas that phobic and crystalline anguish retreated and\\nreverberated. There was no light, but I knew from the empty space at\\nmy right that Tobey was gone, God alone knew whither. Across my chest\\nstill lay the heavy arm of the sleeper at my left.\\n\\nThen came the devastating stroke of lightning which shook the whole\\nmountain, lit the darkest crypts of the hoary grove, and splintered\\nthe patriarch of the twisted trees. In the demon flash of a monstrous\\nfireball the sleeper started up suddenly while the glare from beyond\\nthe window threw his shadow vividly upon the chimney above the\\nfireplace from which my eyes had never strayed. That I am still alive\\nand sane, is a marvel I can not fathom. I can not fathom it, for the\\nshadow on that chimney was not that of George Bennett or of any other\\nhuman creature; but a blasphemous abnormality from hell\\'s nethermost\\ncraters; a nameless, shapeless abomination which no mind could fully\\ngrasp and no pen even partly describe. In another second I was alone\\nin the accursed mansion, shivering and gibbering. George Bennett and\\nWilliam Tobey had left no trace, not even of a struggle. They were\\nnever heard of again.\\n\\n2. A Passer in the Storm\\n\\nFor days after that hideous experience in the forest-swathed mansion\\nI lay nervously exhausted in my hotel room at Lefferts Corners. I do\\nnot remember exactly how I managed to reach the motor-car, start it,\\nand slip unobserved back to the village; for I retain no distinct\\nimpression save of wild-armed titan trees, demoniac mutterings of\\nthunder, and Charonian shadows athwart the low mounds that dotted and\\nstreaked the region.\\n\\nAs I shivered and brooded on the casting of that brain-blasting shadow,\\nI knew that I had at last pried out one of earth\\'s supreme horrorsâ\\x80\\x94one\\nof those nameless blights of outer voids whose faint demon scratchings\\nwe sometimes hear on the farthest rim of space, yet from which our own\\nfinite vision has given us a merciful immunity. The shadow I had seen,\\nI hardly dared to analyze or identify. Something had lain between me\\nand the window that night, but I shuddered whenever I could not cast\\noff the instinct to classify it. If it had only snarled, or bayed,\\nor laughed titteringlyâ\\x80\\x94even that would have relieved the abysmal\\nhideousness. But it was so silent. It had rested a heavy arm or foreleg\\non my chest.... Obviously it was organic, or had once been organic....\\nJan Martense, whose room I had invaded, was buried in the graveyard\\nnear the mansion.... I must find Bennett and Tobey, if they lived ...\\nwhy had it picked them, and left me for the last?... Drowsiness is so\\nstifling, and dreams are so horrible....\\n\\nIn a short time I realized that I must tell my story to someone or\\nbreak down completely. I had already decided not to abandon the quest\\nfor the lurking fear, for in my rash ignorance it seemed to me that\\nuncertainty was worse than enlightenment, however terrible the latter\\nmight prove to be. Accordingly I revolved in my mind the best course\\nto pursue; whom to select for my confidences, and how to track down the\\nthing which had obliterated two men and cast a nightmare shadow.\\n\\nMy chief acquaintances at Lefferts Corners had been the affable\\nreporters, of whom several still remained to collect final echoes of\\nthe tragedy. It was from these that I determined to choose a colleague,\\nand the more I reflected the more my preference inclined toward one\\nArthur Munroe, a dark, lean man of about thirty-five, whose education,\\ntaste, intelligence, and temperament all seemed to mark him as one not\\nbound to conventional ideas and experiences.\\n\\nOn an afternoon in early September Arthur Munroe listened to my story.\\nI saw from the beginning that he was both interested and sympathetic,\\nand when I had finished he analyzed and discussed the thing with the\\ngreatest shrewdness and judgment. His advice, moreover, was eminently\\npractical; for he recommended a postponement of operations at the\\nMartense mansion until we might become fortified with more detailed\\nhistorical and geographical data. On his initiative we combed the\\ncountryside for information regarding the terrible Martense family, and\\ndiscovered a man who possessed a marvelously illuminating ancestral\\ndiary. We also talked at length with such of the mountain mongrels\\nas had not fled from the terror and confusion to remoter slopes, and\\narranged to precede our culminating taskâ\\x80\\x94the exhaustive and definitive\\nexamination of the mansion in the light of its detailed historyâ\\x80\\x94with\\nan equally exhaustive and definitive examination of spots associated\\nwith the various tragedies of squatter legend.\\n\\nThe results of this examination were not at first very enlightening,\\nthough our tabulation of them seemed to reveal a fairly significant\\ntrend; namely, that the number of reported horrors was by far the\\ngreatest in areas either comparatively near the avoided house or\\nconnected with it by stretches of the morbidly overnourished forest.\\nThere were, it is true, exceptions; indeed, the horror which had caught\\nthe world\\'s ear had happened in a treeless space remote alike from the\\nmansion and from any connecting woods.\\n\\nAs to the nature and appearance of the lurking fear, nothing could\\nbe gained from the scared and witless shanty-dwellers. In the same\\nbreath they called it a snake and a giant, a thunder-devil and a bat, a\\nvulture and a walking tree. We did, however, deem ourselves justified\\nin assuming that it was a living organism highly susceptible to\\nelectrical storms; and although certain of the stories suggested wings,\\nwe believed that its aversion for open spaces made land locomotion\\na more probable theory. The only thing really incompatible with the\\nlatter view was the rapidity with which the creature must have traveled\\nin order to perform all the deeds attributed to it.\\n\\nWhen we came to know the squatters better, we found them curiously\\nlikable in many ways. Simple animals they were, gently descending\\nthe evolutionary scale because of their unfortunate ancestry and\\nstultifying isolation. They feared outsiders, but slowly grew\\naccustomed to us; finally helping vastly when we beat down all the\\nthickets and tore out all the partitions of the mansion in our search\\nfor the lurking fear. When we asked them to help us find Bennett and\\nTobey they were truly distressed; for they wanted to help us, yet knew\\nthat these victims had gone as wholly out of the world as their own\\nmissing people. That great numbers of them had actually been killed\\nand removed, just as the wild animals had long been exterminated, we\\nwere of course thoroughly convinced; and we waited apprehensively for\\nfurther tragedies to occur.\\n\\nBy the middle of October we were puzzled by our lack of progress. Owing\\nto the clear nights no demoniac aggressions had taken place, and the\\ncompleteness of our vain searches of house and country almost drove us\\nto regard the lurking fear as a non-material agency. We feared that\\nthe cold weather would come on and halt our explorations, for all\\nagreed that the demon was generally quiet in winter. Thus there was\\na kind of haste and desperation in our last daylight canvass of the\\nhorror-visited hamlet; a hamlet now deserted because of the squatters\\'\\nfears.\\n\\nThe ill-fated squatter hamlet had borne no name, but had long stood\\nin a sheltered though treeless cleft between two elevations called\\nrespectively Cone Mountain and Maple Hill. It was closer to Maple Hill\\nthan to Cone Mountain, some of the crude abodes indeed being dugouts on\\nthe side of the former eminence. Geographically it lay about two miles\\nnorthwest of the base of Tempest Mountain, and three miles from the\\noak-girt mansion. Of the distance between the hamlet and the mansion,\\nfully two miles and a quarter on the hamlet\\'s side was entirely open\\ncountry; the plain being of fairly level character save for some of the\\nlow snakelike mounds, and having as vegetation only grass and scattered\\nweeds. Considering this topography, we had finally concluded that\\nthe demon must have come by way of Cone Mountain, a wooded southern\\nprolongation of which ran to within a short distance of the westernmost\\nspur of Tempest Mountain. The upheaval of ground we traced conclusively\\nto a landslide from Maple Hill, a tall lone splintered tree on whose\\nside had been the striking point of the thunderbolt which summoned the\\nfiend.\\n\\nAs for the twentieth time or more Arthur Munroe and I went minutely\\nover every inch of the violated village, we were filled with a\\ncertain discouragement coupled with vague and novel fears. It was\\nacutely uncanny, even when frightful and uncanny things were common,\\nto encounter so blankly clueless a scene after such overwhelming\\noccurrences; and we moved about beneath the leaden, darkening sky with\\nthat tragic directionless zeal which results from a combined sense of\\nfutility and necessity of action. Our care was gravely minute; every\\ncottage was again entered, every hillside dugout again searched for\\nbodies, every thorny foot of adjacent slope again scanned for dens and\\ncaves, but all without result. And yet, as I have said, vague new fears\\nhovered menacingly over us; as if giant bat-winged gryphons squatted\\ninvisibly on the mountain-tops and leered with Abaddon-eyes that had\\nlooked on transcosmic gulfs.\\n\\nAs the afternoon advanced, it became increasingly difficult to see; and\\nwe heard the rumble of a thunderstorm gathering over Tempest Mountain.\\nThis sound in such a locality naturally stirred us, though less than\\nit would have done at night. As it was, we hoped desperately that the\\nstorm would last until well after dark; and with that hope turned from\\nour aimless hillside searching toward the nearest inhabited hamlet to\\ngather a body of squatters as helpers in the investigation. Timid as\\nthey were, a few of the younger men were sufficiently inspired by our\\nprotective leadership to promise such help.\\n\\nWe had hardly more than turned, however, when there descended such a\\nblinding sheet of torrential rain that shelter became imperative. The\\nextreme, almost nocturnal darkness of the sky caused us to stumble\\nsadly, but guided by the frequent flashes of lightning and by our\\nminute knowledge of the hamlet we soon reached the least porous cabin\\nof the lot; an heterogeneous combination of logs and boards whose still\\nexisting door and single tiny window both faced Maple Hill. Barring\\nthe door after us against the fury of the wind and rain, we put in\\nplace the crude window shutter which our frequent searches had taught\\nus where to find. It was dismal sitting there on rickety boxes in the\\npitchy darkness, but we smoked pipes and occasionally flashed our\\npocket lamps about. Now and then we could see the lightning through\\ncracks in the wall; the afternoon was so incredibly dark that each\\nflash was extremely vivid.\\n\\nThe stormy vigil reminded me shudderingly of my ghastly night on\\nTempest Mountain. My mind turned to that odd question which had kept\\nrecurring ever since the nightmare thing had happened; and again I\\nwondered why the demon, approaching the three watchers either from the\\nwindow or the interior, had begun with the men on each side and left\\nthe middle man till the last, when the titan fireball had scared it\\naway. Why had it not taken its victims in natural order, with myself\\nsecond, from whichever direction it had approached? With what manner\\nof far-reaching tentacles did it prey? Or did it know that I was the\\nleader, and save me for a fate worse than that of my companions?\\n\\nIn the midst of these reflections, as if dramatically arranged to\\nintensify them, there fell near by a terrific bolt of lightning\\nfollowed by the sound of sliding earth. At the same time the wolfish\\nwind rose to demoniac crescendos of ululation. We were sure that the\\nlone tree on Maple Hill had been struck again, and Munroe rose from\\nhis box and went to the tiny window to ascertain the damage. When he\\ntook down the shutter the wind and rain howled deafeningly in, so that\\nI could not hear what he said; but I waited while he leaned out and\\ntried to fathom nature\\'s pandemonium.\\n\\nGradually a calming of the wind and dispersal of the unusual darkness\\ntold of the storm\\'s passing. I had hoped it would last into the night\\nto help our quest, but a furtive sunbeam from a knothole behind me\\nremoved the likelihood of such a thing. Suggesting to Munroe that we\\nhad better get some light even if more showers came, I unbarred and\\nopened the crude door. The ground outside was a singular mass of mud\\nand pools, with fresh heaps of earth from the slight landslide; but I\\nsaw nothing to justify the interest which kept my companion silently\\nleaning out the window. Crossing to where he leaned, I touched his\\nshoulder; but he did not move. Then, as I playfully shook him and\\nturned him around, I felt the strangling tendrils of a cancerous horror\\nwhose roots reached into illimitable pasts and fathomless abysms of the\\nnight that broods beyond time.\\n\\nFor Arthur Munroe was dead. And on what remained of his chewed and\\ngouged head there was no longer a face.\\n\\n3. What the Red Glare Meant\\n\\nOn the tempest-racked night of November 8th, 1921, with a lantern which\\ncast charnel shadows, I stood digging alone and idiotically in the\\ngrave of Jan Martense. I had begun to dig in the afternoon, because a\\nthunderstorm was brewing, and now that it was dark and the storm had\\nburst above the maniacally thick foliage I was glad.\\n\\nI believe that my mind was partly unhinged by events since August 5th;\\nthe demon shadow in the mansion, the general strain and disappointment,\\nand the thing that occurred at the hamlet in an October storm.\\nAfter that thing I had dug a grave for one whose death I could not\\nunderstand. I knew that others could not understand either, so let\\nthem think Arthur Munroe had wandered away. They searched, but found\\nnothing. The squatters might have understood, but I dared not frighten\\nthem more. I myself seemed strangely callous. That shock at the mansion\\nhad done something to my brain, and I could think only of the quest for\\na horror now grown to cataclysmic stature in my imagination; a quest\\nwhich the fate of Arthur Munroe made me vow to keep silent and solitary.\\n\\nThe scene of my excavations would alone have been enough to unnerve\\nany ordinary man. Baleful primal trees of unholy size, age, and\\ngrotesqueness leered above me like the pillars of some hellish Druidic\\ntemple; muffling the thunder, hushing the clawing wind, and admitting\\nbut little rain. Beyond the scarred trunks in the background, illumined\\nby faint flashes of filtered lightning, rose the damp ivied stones of\\nthe deserted mansion, while somewhat nearer was the abandoned Dutch\\ngarden whose walks and beds were polluted by a white, fungous, fetid,\\novernourished vegetation that never saw full daylight. And nearest of\\nall was the graveyard, where deformed trees tossed insane branches\\nas their roots displaced unhallowed slabs and sucked venom from what\\nlay below. Now and then, beneath the brown pall of leaves that rotted\\nand festered in the antediluvian forest darkness, I could trace the\\nsinister outlines of some of these low mounds which characterized the\\nlightning-pierced region.\\n\\nHistory had led me to this archaic grave. History, indeed, was all I\\nhad after everything else ended in mocking Satanism. I now believed\\nthat the lurking fear was no material thing, but a wolf-fanged ghost\\nthat rode the midnight lightning. And I believed, because of the masses\\nof local tradition I had unearthed in my search with Arthur Munroe,\\nthat the ghost was that of Jan Martense, who died in 1762. That is why\\nI was digging idiotically in his grave.\\n\\nThe Martense mansion was built in 1670 by Gerrit Martense, a wealthy\\nNew Amsterdam merchant who disliked the changing order under British\\nrule, and had constructed this magnificent domicile on a remote\\nwoodland summit whose untrodden solitude and unusual scenery pleased\\nhim. The only substantial disappointment encountered in this site was\\nthat which concerned the prevalence of violent thunderstorms in summer.\\nWhen selecting the hill and building his mansion, Mynheer Martense\\nhad laid these frequent natural outbursts to some peculiarity of the\\nyear; but in time he perceived that the locality was especially liable\\nto such phenomena. At length, having found these storms injurious to\\nhis head, he fitted up a cellar into which he could retreat from their\\nwildest pandemonium.\\n\\nOf Gerrit Martense\\'s descendants less is known than of himself; since\\nthey were all reared in hatred of the English civilization, and\\ntrained to shun such of the colonists as accepted it. Their life was\\nexceedingly secluded, and people declared that their isolation had made\\nthem heavy of speech and comprehension. In appearance all were marked\\nby a peculiar inherited dissimilarity of eyes; one generally being\\nblue and the other brown. Their social contacts grew fewer and fewer,\\ntill at last they took to intermarrying with the numerous menial class\\nabout the estate. Many of the crowded family degenerated, moved across\\nthe valley, and merged with the mongrel population which was later to\\nproduce the pitiful squatters. The rest had stuck sullenly to their\\nancestral mansion, becoming more and more clannish and taciturn, yet\\ndeveloping a nervous responsiveness to the frequent thunderstorms.\\n\\nMost of this information reached the outside world through young Jan\\nMartense, who from some kind of restlessness joined the colonial army\\nwhen news of the Albany Convention reached Tempest Mountain. He was\\nthe first of Gerrit\\'s descendants to see much of the world; and when\\nhe returned in 1760, after six years of campaigning, he was hated\\nas an outsider by his father, uncles, and brothers, in spite of his\\ndissimilar Martense eyes. No longer could he share the peculiarities\\nand prejudices of the Martenses, while the very mountain thunderstorms\\nfailed to intoxicate him as they had before. Instead, his surroundings\\ndepressed him; and he frequently wrote to a friend in Albany of plans\\nto leave the paternal roof.\\n\\nIn the spring of 1763 Jonathan Gifford, the Albany friend of Jan\\nMartense, became worried by his correspondent\\'s silence; especially in\\nview of the conditions and quarrels at the Martense mansion. Determined\\nto visit Jan in person, he went into the mountains on horseback. His\\ndiary states that he reached Tempest Mountain on September 20th,\\nfinding the mansion in great decrepitude. The sullen, odd-eyed\\nMartenses, whose unclean animal aspect shocked him, told him in broken\\ngutturals than Jan was dead. He had, they insisted, been struck by\\nlightning the autumn before, and now lay buried behind the neglected\\nsunken gardens. They showed the visitor the grave, barren and devoid of\\nmarkers. Something in the Martenses\\' manner gave Gifford a feeling of\\nrepulsion and suspicion, and a week later he returned with spade and\\nmattock to explore the sepulchral spot. He found what he expectedâ\\x80\\x94a\\nskull crushed cruelly as if by savage blowsâ\\x80\\x94so returning to Albany he\\nopenly charged the Martenses with the murder of their kinsman.\\n\\nLegal evidence was lacking, but the story spread rapidly around the\\ncountryside; and from that time the Martenses were ostracized by the\\nworld. No one would deal with them, and their distant manor was shunned\\nas an accursed place. Somehow they managed to live on independently\\nby the products of their estate, for occasional lights glimpsed from\\nfar-away hills attested their continued presence. These lights were\\nseen as late as 1810, but toward the last they became very infrequent.\\n\\nMeanwhile there grew up about the mansion and the mountain a body of\\ndiabolic legendry. The place was avoided with doubled assiduousness,\\nand invested with every whispered myth tradition could supply. It\\nremained unvisited till 1816, when the continued absence of lights was\\nnoticed by the squatters. At that time a party made investigations,\\nfinding the house deserted and partly in ruins.\\n\\nThere were no skeletons about, so that departure rather than death\\nwas inferred. The clan seemed to have left several years before,\\nand improvised penthouses showed how numerous it had grown prior to\\nits migration. Its cultural level had fallen very low, as proved by\\ndecaying furniture and scattered silverware which must have been long\\nabandoned when its owners left. But though the dreaded Martenses were\\ngone, the fear of the haunted house continued; and grew very acute\\nwhen new and strange stories arose among the mountain decadents. There\\nit stood; deserted, feared, and linked with the vengeful ghost of Jan\\nMartense. There it still stood on the night I dug in Jan Martense\\'s\\ngrave.\\n\\nI have described my protracted digging as idiotic, and such it indeed\\nwas in object and method. The coffin of Jan Martense had been soon\\nunearthedâ\\x80\\x94it now held only dust and niterâ\\x80\\x94but in my fury to exhume\\nhis ghost I delved irrationally and clumsily down beneath where he had\\nlain. God knows what I expected to findâ\\x80\\x94I only felt that I was digging\\nin the grave of a man whose ghost stalked by night.\\n\\nIt is impossible to say what monstrous depth I had attained when my\\nspade, and soon my feet, broke through the ground beneath. The event,\\nunder the circumstances, was tremendous; for in the existence of a\\nsubterranean space here, my mad theories had terrible confirmation. My\\nslight fall had extinguished the lantern, but I produced an electric\\npocket-lamp and viewed the small horizontal tunnel which led away\\nindefinitely in both directions. It was amply large for a man to\\nwriggle through; and though no sane person would have tried it at that\\ntime, I forgot danger, reason, and cleanliness in my single-minded\\nfever to unearth the lurking fear. Choosing the direction toward the\\nhouse, I scrambled recklessly into the narrow burrow; squirming ahead\\nblindly and rapidly, and flashing but seldom the lamp I kept before me.\\n\\nWhat language can describe the spectacle of a man lost in infinitely\\nabysmal earth; pawing, twisting, wheezing; scrambling madly through\\nsunken convolutions of immemorial blackness without an idea of time,\\nsafety, direction, or definite object? There is something hideous in\\nit, but that is what I did. I did it for so long that life faded to\\na far memory, and I became one with the moles and grubs of nighted\\ndepths. Indeed, it was only by accident that after interminable\\nwrithings I jarred my forgotten electric lamp alight, so that it shone\\neerily along the burrow of caked loam that stretched and curved ahead.\\n\\nI had been scrambling in this way for some time, so that my battery\\nhad burned very low, when the passage suddenly inclined sharply\\nupward, altering my mode of progress. And as I raised my glance it\\nwas without preparation that I saw glistening in the distance two\\ndemoniac reflections of my expiring lamp; two reflections glowing\\nwith a baneful and unmistakable effulgence, and provoking maddeningly\\nnebulous memories. I stopped automatically, though lacking the brain to\\nretreat. The eyes approached, yet of the thing that bore them I could\\ndistinguish only a claw. But what a claw! Then far overhead I heard\\na faint crashing which I recognized. It was the wild thunder of the\\nmountain, raised to hysteric fury. I must have been crawling upward for\\nsome time, so that the surface was now quite near. And as the muffled\\nthunder clattered, those eyes still stared with vacuous viciousness.\\n\\nThank God I did not then know what it was, else I should have died.\\nBut I was saved by the very thunder that had summoned it, for after\\na hideous wait there burst from the unseen outside sky one of those\\nfrequent mountainward bolts whose aftermath I had noticed here and\\nthere as gashes of disturbed earth and fulgurites of various sizes.\\nWith Cyclopean rage it tore through the soil above that damnable pit,\\nblinding and deafening me, yet not wholly reducing me to a coma.\\n\\nIn the chaos of sliding, shifting earth I clawed and floundered\\nhelplessly till the rain on my head steadied me and I saw that I had\\ncome to the surface in a familiar spot; a steep unforested place on the\\nsouthwest slope of the mountain. Recurrent sheet lightnings illumed the\\ntumbled ground and the remains of the curious low hummock which had\\nstretched down from the wooded higher slope, but there was nothing in\\nthe chaos to show my place of egress from the lethal catacomb. My brain\\nwas as great a chaos as the earth, and as a distant red glare burst on\\nthe landscape from the south I hardly realized the horror I had been\\nthrough.\\n\\nBut when two days later the squatters told me what the red glare\\nmeant, I felt more horror than that which the mold-burrow and the\\nclaw and eyes had given; more horror because of the overwhelming\\nimplications. In a hamlet twenty miles away an orgy of fear had\\nfollowed the bolt which brought me above ground, and a nameless thing\\nhad dropped from an overhanging tree into a weak-roofed cabin. It had\\ndone a deed, but the squatters had fired the cabin in frenzy before it\\ncould escape. It had been doing that deed at the very moment the earth\\ncaved in on the thing with the claw and eyes.\\n\\n4. The Horror in the Eyes\\n\\nThere can be nothing normal in the mind of one who, knowing what I\\nknew of the horrors of Tempest Mountain, would seek alone for the fear\\nthat lurked there. That at least two of the fear\\'s embodiments were\\ndestroyed, formed but a slight guarantee of mental and physical safety\\nin this Acheron of multiform diabolism; yet I continued my quest with\\neven greater zeal as events and revelations became more monstrous.\\n\\nWhen, two days after my frightful crawl through that crypt of the eyes\\nand claw, I learned that a thing had malignly hovered twenty miles\\naway at the same instant the eyes were glaring at me, I experienced\\nvirtual convulsions of fright. But that fright was so mixed with wonder\\nand alluring grotesqueness that it was almost a pleasant sensation.\\nSometimes, in the throes of a nightmare when unseen powers whirl one\\nover the roofs of strange dead cities toward the grinning chasm of\\nNis, it is a relief and even a delight to shriek wildly and throw\\noneself voluntarily along with the hideous vortex of dream-doom down\\ninto whatever bottomless gulf may yawn. And so it was with the waking\\nnightmare of Tempest Mountain; the discovery that two monsters had\\nhaunted the spot gave me ultimately a mad craving to plunge into the\\nvery earth of the accursed region, and with bare hands dig out the\\ndeath that leered from every inch of the poisonous soil.\\n\\nAs soon as possible I visited the grave of Jan Martense and dug vainly\\nwhere I had dug before. Some extensive cave-in had obliterated all\\ntrace of the underground passage, while the rain had washed so much\\nearth back into the excavation that I could not tell how deeply I had\\ndug that other day. I likewise made a difficult trip to the distant\\nhamlet where the death-creature had been burnt, and was little repaid\\nfor my trouble. In the ashes of the fateful cabin I found several\\nbones, but apparently none of the monster\\'s. The squatters said the\\nthing had had only one victim; but in this I judged them inaccurate,\\nsince besides the complete skull of a human being, there was another\\nbony fragment which seemed certainly to have belonged to a human skull\\nat some time. Though the rapid drop of the monster had been seen, no\\none could say just what the creature was like; those who had glimpsed\\nit called it simply a devil. Examining the great tree where it had\\nlurked, I could discern no distinctive marks. I tried to find some\\ntrail into the black forest, but on this occasion could not stand the\\nsight of those morbidly large boles, or of those vast serpentlike roots\\nthat twisted so malevolently before they sank into the earth.\\n\\nMy next step was to re-examine with microscopic care the deserted\\nhamlet where death had come most abundantly, and where Arthur Munroe\\nhad seen something he never lived to describe. Though my vain previous\\nsearches had been exceedingly minute, I now had new data to test; for\\nmy horrible grave-crawl convinced me that at least one of the phases\\nof the monstrosity had been an underground creature. This time, on the\\n14th of November, my quest concerned itself mostly with the slopes\\nof Cone Mountain and Maple Hill where they overlook the unfortunate\\nhamlet, and I gave particular attention to the loose earth of the\\nlandslide region on the latter eminence.\\n\\nThe afternoon of my search brought nothing to light, and dusk came\\nas I stood on Maple Hill looking down at the hamlet and across the\\nvalley to Tempest Mountain. There had been a gorgeous sunset, and now\\nthe moon came up, nearly full and shedding a silver flood over the\\nplain, the distant mountainside, and the curious low mounds that rose\\nhere and there. It was a peaceful Arcadian scene, but knowing what it\\nhid I hated it. I hated the mocking moon, the hypocritical plain, the\\nfestering mountain, and those sinister mounds. Everything seemed to me\\ntainted with a loathsome contagion, and inspired by a noxious alliance\\nwith distorted hidden powers.\\n\\nPresently, as I gazed abstractedly at the moonlit panorama, my eye\\nbecame attracted by something singular in the nature and arrangement\\nof a certain topographical element. Without having any exact knowledge\\nof geology, I had from the first been interested in the odd mounds\\nand hummocks of the region. I had noticed that they were pretty\\nwidely distributed around Tempest Mountain, though less numerous on\\nthe plain than near the hilltop itself, where prehistoric glaciation\\nhad doubtless found feebler opposition to its striking and fantastic\\ncaprices. Now, in the light of that low moon which cast long weird\\nshadows, it struck me forcibly that the various points and lines of the\\nmound system had a peculiar relation to the summit of Tempest Mountain.\\nThat summit was undeniably a center from which the lines or rows of\\npoints radiated indefinitely and irregularly, as if the unwholesome\\nMartense mansion had thrown out visible tentacles of terror. The idea\\nof such tentacles gave me an unexplained thrill, and I stopped to\\nanalyze my reason for believing these mounds glacial phenomena.\\n\\nThe more I analyzed the less I believed, and against my newly opened\\nmind there began to beat grotesque and horrible analogies based on\\nsuperficial aspects and upon my experience beneath the earth. Before\\nI knew it I was uttering frenzied and disjointed words to myself: \"My\\nGod! ... Molehills ... the damned place must be honeycombed ... how\\nmany ... that night at the mansion ... they took Bennett and Tobey\\nfirst ... on each side of us.\" ... Then I was digging frantically\\ninto the mound which had stretched nearest me; digging desperately,\\nshiveringly, but almost jubilantly; digging and at last shrieking aloud\\nwith some unplaced emotion as I came upon a tunnel or burrow just like\\nthe one through which I had crawled on that other demoniac night.\\n\\nAfter that I recall running, spade in hand; a hideous run across\\nmoon-litten, mound-marked meadows and through diseased, precipitous\\nabysses of haunted hillside forest; leaping, screaming, panting,\\nbounding toward the terrible Martense mansion. I recall digging\\nunreasoningly in all parts of the brier-choked cellar; digging to find\\nthe core and center of that malignant universe of mounds. And then I\\nrecall how I laughed when I stumbled on the passageway; the hole at\\nthe base of the old chimney, where the thick weeds grew and cast queer\\nshadows in the light of the lone candle I had happened to have with me.\\nWhat still remained down in that hell-hive, lurking and waiting for the\\nthunder to arouse it, I did not know. Two had been killed; perhaps that\\nhad finished it. But still there remained that burning determination to\\nreach the innermost secret of the fear, which I had once more come to\\ndeem definite, material, and organic.\\n\\nMy indecisive speculation whether to explore the passage alone and\\nimmediately with my pocket-light or to try to assemble a band of\\nsquatters for the quest was interrupted after a time by a sudden rush\\nof wind from the outside which blew out the candle and left me in stark\\nblackness. The moon no longer shone through the chinks and apertures\\nabove me, and with a sense of fateful alarm I heard the sinister and\\nsignificant rumble of approaching thunder. A confusion of associated\\nideas possessed my brain, leading me to grope back toward the farthest\\ncorner of the cellar. My eyes, however, never turned away from the\\nhorrible opening at the base of the chimney; and I began to get\\nglimpses of the crumbling bricks and unhealthy weeds as faint glows\\nof lightning penetrated the woods outside and illumined the chinks in\\nthe upper wall. Every second I was consumed with a mixture of fear\\nand curiosity. What would the storm call forthâ\\x80\\x94or was there anything\\nleft for it to call? Guided by a lightning flash I settled myself down\\nbehind a dense clump of vegetation, through which I could see the\\nopening without being seen.\\n\\nIf heaven is merciful, it will some day efface from my consciousness\\nthe sight that I saw, and let me live my last years in peace. I can\\nnot sleep at night now, and have to take opiates when it thunders. The\\nthing came abruptly and unannounced; a demon, ratlike scurrying from\\npits remote and unimaginable, a hellish panting and stifled grunting,\\nand then from that opening beneath the chimney a burst of multitudinous\\nand leprous lifeâ\\x80\\x94a loathsome night-spawned flood of organic corruption\\nmore devastatingly hideous than the blackest conjurations of mortal\\nmadness and morbidity. Seething, stewing, surging, bubbling like\\nserpents\\' slime it rolled up and out of that yawning hole, spreading\\nlike a septic contagion and streaming from the cellar at every point of\\negressâ\\x80\\x94streaming out to scatter through the accursed midnight forests\\nand strew fear, madness, and death.\\n\\nGod knows how many there wereâ\\x80\\x94there must have been thousands. To see\\nthe stream of them in that faint, intermittent lightning was shocking.\\nWhen they had thinned out enough to be glimpsed as separate organisms,\\nI saw that they were dwarfed, deformed hairy devils or apesâ\\x80\\x94monstrous\\nand diabolic caricatures of the monkey tribe. They were so hideously\\nsilent; there was hardly a squeal when one of the last stragglers\\nturned with the skill of long practise to make a meal in accustomed\\nfashion on a weaker companion. Others snapped up what it left and ate\\nwith slavering relish. Then, in spite of my daze of fright and disgust,\\nmy morbid curiosity triumphed; and as the last of the monstrosities\\noozed up alone from that nether world of unknown nightmare, I drew my\\nautomatic pistol and shot it under cover of the thunder.\\n\\nShrieking, slithering, torrential shadows of red viscous madness\\nchasing one another through endless, ensanguined corridors of purple\\nfulgurous sky ... formless phantasms and kaleidoscopic mutations of a\\nghoulish, remembered scene; forests of monstrous overnourished oaks\\nwith serpent roots twisting and sucking unnamable juices from an\\nearth verminous with millions of cannibal devils; moundlike tentacles\\ngroping from underground nuclei of polypous perversion ... insane\\nlightning over malignant ivied walls and demon arcades choked with\\nfungous vegetation.... Heaven be thanked for the instinct which led me\\nunconscious to places where men dwell; to the peaceful village that\\nslept under the calm stars of clearing skies.\\n\\n\"They were slithering shadows of red madness.\"\\n\\nI had recovered enough in a week to send to Albany for a gang of\\nmen to blow up the Martense mansion and the entire top of Tempest\\nMountain with dynamite, stop up all the discoverable mound-burrows,\\nand destroy certain overnourished trees whose very existence seemed an\\ninsult to sanity. I could sleep a little after they had done this, but\\ntrue rest will never come as long as I remember that nameless secret\\nof the lurking fear. The thing will haunt me, for who can say the\\nextermination is complete, and that analogous phenomena do not exist\\nall over the world? Who can, with my knowledge, think of the earth\\'s\\nunknown caverns without a nightmare dread of future possibilities? I\\ncan not see a well or a subway entrance without shuddering ... why can\\nnot the doctors give me something to make me sleep, or truly calm my\\nbrain when it thunders?\\n\\nWhat I saw in the glow of my flashlight after I shot the unspeakable\\nstraggling object was so simple that almost a minute elapsed before\\nI understood and went delirious. The object was nauseous; a filthy\\nwhitish gorilla thing with sharp yellow fangs and matted fur. It was\\nthe ultimate product of mammalian degeneration; the frightful outcome\\nof isolated spawning, multiplication, and cannibal nutrition above and\\nbelow the ground; the embodiment of all the snarling chaos and grinning\\nfear that lurk behind life. It had looked at me as it died, and its\\neyes had the same odd quality that marked those other eyes which had\\nstared at me underground and excited cloudy recollections. One eye\\nwas blue, the other brown. They were the dissimilar Martense eyes of\\nthe old legends, and I knew in one inundating cataclysm of voiceless\\nhorror what had become of that vanished family; the terrible and\\nthunder-crazed house of Martense.',\n",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\\n\\nInto the granite city of Teloth wandered the youth, vine-crowned, his\\nyellow hair glistening with myrrh and his purple robe torn with briers\\nof the mountain Sidrak that lies across the antique bridge of stone.\\nThe men of Teloth are dark and stern, and dwell in square houses, and\\nwith frowns they asked the stranger whence he had come and what were\\nhis name and fortune. So the youth answered:\\n\\n\"I am Iranon, and come from Aira, a far city that I recall only dimly\\nbut seek to find again. I am a singer of songs that I learned in the\\nfar city, and my calling is to make beauty with the things remembered\\nof childhood. My wealth is in little memories and dreams, and in hopes\\nthat I sing in gardens when the moon is tender and the west wind stirs\\nthe lotus-buds.\"\\n\\nWhen the men of Teloth heard these things they whispered to one\\nanother; for though in the granite city there is no laughter or\\nsong, the stern men sometimes look to the Karthian hills in the\\nspring and think of the lutes of distant Oonai whereof travelers have\\ntold. And thinking thus, they bade the stranger stay and sing in the\\nsquare before the Tower of Mlin, though they liked not the color of\\nhis tattered robe, nor the myrrh in his hair, nor his chaplet of\\nvine-leaves, nor the youth in his golden voice. At evening Iranon\\nsang, and while he sang an old man prayed and a blind man said he saw\\na nimbus over the singer\\'s head. But most of the men of Teloth yawned,\\nand some laughed and some went away to sleep; for Iranon told nothing\\nuseful, singing only his memories, his dreams, and his hopes.\\n\\n\"I remember the twilight, the moon, and soft songs, and the window\\nwhere I was rocked to sleep. And through the window was the street\\nwhere the golden lights came, and where the shadows danced on houses of\\nmarble. I remember the square of moonlight on the floor, that was not\\nlike any other light, and the visions that danced in the moonbeams when\\nmy mother sang to me. And too, I remember the sun of morning bright\\nabove the many-colored hills in summer, and the sweetness of flowers\\nborne on the south wind that made the trees sing.\\n\\n\"O Aira, city of marble and beryl, how many are thy beauties! How loved\\nI the warm and fragrant groves across the hyaline Nithra, and the falls\\nof the tiny Kra that flowed through the verdant valley! In those groves\\nand in that vale the children wove wreaths for one another, and at dusk\\nI dreamed strange dreams under the yath-trees on the mountain as I saw\\nbelow me the lights of the city, and the curving Nithra reflecting a\\nribbon of stars.\\n\\n\"And in the city were palaces of veined and tinted marble, with\\ngolden domes and painted walls, and green gardens with cerulean pools\\nand crystal fountains. Often I played in the gardens and waded in the\\npools, and lay and dreamed among the pale flowers under the trees. And\\nsometimes at sunset I would climb the long hilly street to the citadel\\nand the open place, and look down upon Aira, the magic city of marble\\nand beryl, splendid in a robe of golden flame.\\n\\n\"Long have I missed thee, Aira, for I was but young when we went into\\nexile; but my father was thy King and I shall come again to thee, for\\nit is so decreed of Fate. All through seven lands have I sought thee,\\nand some day shall I reign over thy groves and gardens, thy streets and\\npalaces, and sing to men who shall know whereof I sing, and laugh not.\\nFor I am Iranon, who was a Prince in Aira.\"\\n\\nThat night the men of Teloth lodged the stranger in a stable, and in\\nthe morning an archon came to him and told him to go to the shop of\\nAthok the cobbler, and be apprenticed to him.\\n\\n\"But I am Iranon, a singer of songs,\" he said, \"and have no heart for\\nthe cobbler\\'s trade.\"\\n\\n\"All in Teloth must toil,\" replied the archon, \"for that is the law.\"\\nThen said Iranon:\\n\\n\"Wherefore do ye toil; is it not that ye may live and be happy? And if\\nye toil only that ye may toil more, when shall happiness find you? Ye\\ntoil to live, but is not life made of beauty and song? And if ye suffer\\nno singers among you, where shall be the fruits of your toil? Toil\\nwithout song is like a weary journey without an end. Were not death\\nmore pleasing?\" But the archon was sullen and did not understand, and\\nrebuked the stranger.\\n\\n\"Thou art a strange youth, and I like not thy face or thy voice. The\\nwords thou speakest are blasphemy, for the gods of Teloth have said\\nthat toil is good. Our gods have promised us a haven of life beyond\\ndeath, where there shall be rest without end, and crystal coldness\\namidst which none shall vex his mind with thought or his eyes with\\nbeauty. Go thou then to Athok the cobbler or be gone out of the city by\\nsunset. All here must serve, and song is folly.\"\\n\\n\"Beyond the Karthian hills lieth Oonai, the city of\\nlutes and dancing.\"\\n\\nSo Iranon went out of the stable and walked over the narrow stone\\nstreets between the gloomy square houses of granite, seeking something\\ngreen, for all was of stone. On the faces of men were frowns, but by\\nthe stone embankment along the sluggish river Zuro sate a young boy\\nwith sad eyes gazing into the waters to spy green budding branches\\nwashed down from the hills by the freshets. And the boy said to him:\\n\"Art thou not indeed he of whom the archons tell, who seekest a far\\ncity in a fair land? I am Romnod, and born in the blood of Teloth,\\nbut am not old in the ways of the granite city, and yearn daily for\\nthe warm groves and the distant lands of beauty and song. Beyond\\nthe Karthian hills lieth Oonai, the city of lutes and dancing, which\\nmen whisper of and say is both lovely and terrible. Thither would I\\ngo were I old enough to find the way, and thither shouldst thou go\\nand thou wouldst sing and have men listen to thee. Let us leave the\\ncity Teloth and fare together among the hills of spring. Thou shalt\\nshow me the ways of travel and I will attend thy songs at evening\\nwhen the stars one by one bring dreams to the minds of dreamers. And\\nperadventure it may be that Oonai the city of lutes and dancing is even\\nthe fair Aira thou seekest, for it is told that thou hast not known\\nAira since old days, and a name often changeth. Let us go to Oonai,\\nO Iranon of the golden head, where men shall know our longings and\\nwelcome us as brothers, nor ever laugh or frown at what we say.\" And\\nIranon answered:\\n\\n\"Be it so, small one; if any in this stone place yearn for beauty he\\nmust seek the mountains and beyond, and I would not leave thee to pine\\nby the sluggish Zuro. But think not that delight and understanding\\ndwell just across the Karthian hills, or in any spot thou canst find\\nin a day\\'s, or a year\\'s, or a lustrum\\'s journey. Behold, when I was\\nsmall like thee I dwelt in the valley of Narthos by the frigid Xari,\\nwhere none would listen to my dreams; and I told myself that when\\nolder I would go to Sinara on the southern slope, and sing to smiling\\ndromedarymen in the market place. But when I went to Sinara I found the\\ndromedarymen all drunken and ribald, and saw that their songs were not\\nas mine; so I travelled in a barge down the Xari to onyx-walled Jaren.\\nAnd the soldiers at Jaren laughed at me and drave me out, so that I\\nwandered to other cities.\\n\\n\"I have seen Stethelos that is below the great cataract, and have gazed\\non the marsh where Sarnath once stood. I have been to Thraa, Ilarnek,\\nand Kadatheron on the winding river Ai, and have dwelt long in OlathoÃ«\\nin the land of Lomar. But though I have had listeners sometimes,\\nthey have ever been few, and I know that welcome shall wait me only\\nin Aira, the city of marble and beryl where my father once ruled as\\nKing. So for Aira shall we seek, though it were well to visit distant\\nand lute-blessed Oonai across the Karthian hills, which may indeed be\\nAira, though I think not. Aira\\'s beauty is past imagining, and none can\\ntell of it without rapture, whilst of Oonai the camel-drivers whisper\\nleeringly.\"\\n\\nAt the sunset Iranon and small Romnod went forth from Teloth, and for\\nlong wandered amidst the green hills and cool forests. The way was\\nrough and obscure, and never did they seem nearer to Oonai the city of\\nlutes and dancing; but in the dusk as the stars came out Iranon would\\nsing of Aira and its beauties and Romnod would listen, so that they\\nwere both happy after a fashion. They ate plentifully of fruit and\\nred berries, and marked not the passing of time, but many years must\\nhave slipped away. Small Romnod was now not so small, and spoke deeply\\ninstead of shrilly, though Iranon was always the same, and decked his\\ngolden hair with vines and fragrant resins found in the woods. So it\\ncame to pass one day that Romnod seemed older than Iranon, though\\nhe had been very small when Iranon had found him watching for green\\nbudding branches in Teloth beside the sluggish stone-banked Zura.\\n\\nThen one night when the moon was full the travellers came to a mountain\\ncrest and looked down upon the myriad lights of Oonai. Peasants had\\ntold them they were near, and Iranon knew that this was not his\\nnative city of Aira. The lights of Oonai were not like those of Aira;\\nfor they were harsh and glaring, whilst the lights of Aira shine as\\nsoftly and magically as shone the moonlight on the floor by the window\\nwhere Iranon\\'s mother once rocked him to sleep with song. But Oonai\\nwas a city of lutes and dancing; so Iranon and Romnod went down the\\nsteep slope that they might find men to whom songs and dreams would\\nbring pleasure. And when they were come into the town they found\\nrose-wreathed revellers bound from house to house and leaning from\\nwindows and balconies, who listened to the songs of Iranon and tossed\\nhim flowers and applauded when he was done. Then for a moment did\\nIranon believe he had found those who thought and felt even as he,\\nthough the town was not an hundredth so fair as Aira.\\n\\nWhen dawn came Iranon looked about with dismay, for the domes of\\nOonai were not golden in the sun, but gray and dismal. And the men of\\nOonai were pale with revelling, and dull with wine, and unlike the\\nradiant men of Aira. But because the people had thrown him blossoms\\nand acclaimed his songs Iranon stayed on, and with him Romnod, who\\nliked the revelry of the town and wore in his dark hair roses and\\nmyrtle. Often at night Iranon sang to the revellers, but he was\\nalways as before, crowned only with the vine of the mountains and\\nremembering the marble streets of Aira and the hyaline Nithra. In the\\nfrescoed halls of the monarch did he sing, upon a crystal dais raised\\nover a floor that was a mirror, and as he sang, he brought pictures\\nto his hearers till the floor seemed to reflect old, beautiful and\\nhalf-remembered things instead of the wine-reddened feasters who pelted\\nhim with roses. And the King bade him put away his tattered purple, and\\nclothed him in satin and cloth-of-gold, with rings of green jade and\\nbracelets of tinted ivory, and lodged him in a gilded and tapestried\\nchamber on a bed of sweet carven wood with canopies and coverlets of\\nflower-embroidered silk. Thus dwelt Iranon in Oonai, the city of lutes\\nand dancing.\\n\\nIt is not known how long Iranon tarried in Oonai, but one day the King\\nbrought to the palace some wild whirling dancers from the Liranian\\ndesert, and dusky flute-players from Drinen in the East, and after\\nthat the revellers threw their roses not so much at Iranon as at the\\ndancers and the flute-players. And day by day that Romnod who had been\\na small boy in granite Teloth grew coarser and redder with wine, till\\nhe dreamed less and less, and listened with less delight to the songs\\nof Iranon. But though Iranon was sad he ceased not to sing, and at\\nevening told again his dreams of Aira, the city of marble and beryl.\\nThen one night the reddened and fattened Romnod snored heavily amidst\\nthe poppied silks of his banquet-couch and died writhing, whilst\\nIranon, pale and slender, sang to himself in a far corner. And when\\nIranon had wept over the grave of Romnod and strewn it with green\\nbudding branches, such as Romnod used to love, he put aside his silks\\nand gauds and went forgotten out of Oonai the city of lutes and dancing\\nclad only in the ragged purple in which he had come, and garlanded with\\nfresh vines from the mountains.\\n\\nInto the sunset wandered Iranon, seeking still for his native land\\nand for men who would understand and cherish his songs and dreams. In\\nall the cities of Cydathria and in the lands beyond the Bnazic desert\\ngay-faced children laughed at his olden songs and tattered robe of\\npurple; but Iranon stayed ever young, and wore wreaths upon his golden\\nhead whilst he sang of Aira.\\n\\nSo came he one night to the squalid cot of an antique shepherd, bent\\nand dirty, who kept flocks on a stony slope above a quicksand marsh. To\\nthis man Iranon spoke, as to so many others:\\n\\n\"Canst thou tell me where I may find Aira, the city of marble and\\nberyl, where flows the hyaline Nithra and where the falls of the tiny\\nKra sing to verdant valleys and hills forested with yath-trees?\" And\\nthe shepherd, hearing, looked long and strangely at Iranon, as if\\nrecalling something very far away in time, and noted each line of the\\nstranger\\'s face, and his golden hair, and his crown of vine-leaves. But\\nhe was old, and replied:\\n\\n\"O stranger, I have indeed heard the name of Aira, and the other names\\nthou hast spoken, but they come to me from afar down the waste of\\nlong years. I heard them in my youth from the lips of a playmate, a\\nbeggar\\'s boy given to strange dreams, who would weave long tales about\\nthe moon and the flowers and the west wind. We used to laugh at him,\\nfor we knew him from his birth though he thought himself a King\\'s son.\\nHe was comely, even as thou, but full of folly and strangeness; and he\\nran away when small to find those who would listen gladly to his songs\\nand dreams. How often hath he sung to me of lands that never were, and\\nthings that never can be! Of Aira did he speak much; of Aira and the\\nriver Nithra, and the falls of the tiny Kra. There would he ever say he\\nonce dwelt as a Prince, though here we knew him from his birth. Nor was\\nthere ever a marble city of Aira, or those who could delight in strange\\nsongs, save in the dreams of mine old playmate Iranon who is gone.\"\\n\\nAnd in the twilight, as the stars came out one by one and the moon cast\\non the marsh a radiance like that which a child sees quivering on the\\nfloor as he is rocked to sleep at evening, there walked into the lethal\\nquicksands a very old man in tattered purple, crowned with withered\\nvine leaves and gazing ahead as if upon the golden domes of a fair city\\nwhere dreams are understood.\\n\\nThat night something of youth and beauty died in the elder world.',\n",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\\n\\nWhen Randolph Carter was thirty he lost the key to the gate of dreams.\\nPrior to that time he had made up for the prosiness of life by nightly\\nexcursions to strange and ancient cities beyond space, and lovely,\\nunbelievable garden lands across ethereal seas; but as middle age\\nhardened upon him he felt these liberties slipping away little by\\nlittle, until at last he was cut off altogether. No more could his\\ngalleys sail up the river Oukranos past the gilded spires of Thran, or\\nhis elephant caravans tramp through perfumed jungles in Kled, where\\nforgotten palaces with veined ivory columns sleep lovely and unbroken\\nunder the moon.\\n\\nHe had read too much of things as they are, and talked with too many\\npeople. Well-meaning philosophers had taught him to look into the\\nlogical relations of things, and analyze the processes which shaped\\nhis thoughts and fancies. Wonder had gone away, and he had forgotten\\nthat all life is only a set of pictures in the brain, among which\\nthere is no difference betwixt those born of real things and those\\nborn of inward dreamings, and no cause to value the one above the\\nother. Custom had dinned into his ears a superstitious reverence for\\nthat which tangibly and physically exists, and had made him secretly\\nashamed to dwell in visions. Wise men told him his simple fancies were\\ninane and childish, and he believed it because he could see that they\\nmight easily be so. What he failed to recall was that the deeds of\\nreality are just as inane and childish, and even more absurd because\\ntheir actors persist in fancying them full of meaning and purpose as\\nthe blind purpose grinds aimlessly on from nothing to something back to\\nnothing again, neither heeding nor knowing the wishes or existence of\\nthe minds that flicker for a second now and then in the darkness.\\n\\nThey had chained him down to things that are, and had then explained\\nthe workings of those things till mystery had gone out of the world.\\nWhen he complained, and longed to escape into twilight realms where\\nmagic molded all the little vivid fragments and prized associations of\\nhis mind into vistas of breathless expectancy and unquenchable delight,\\nthey turned him instead toward the new-found prodigies of science,\\nbidding him find wonder in the atom\\'s vortex and mystery in the sky\\'s\\ndimensions. And when he had failed to find these boons in things whose\\nlaws are known and measurable, they told him he lacked imagination, and\\nwas immature because he preferred dream-illusions to the illusions of\\nour physical creation.\\n\\nSo Carter had tried to do as others did, and pretended that the common\\nevents and emotions of earthly minds were more important than the\\nfantasies of rare and delicate souls. He did not dissent when they told\\nhim that the animal pain of a stuck pig or dyspeptic plowman in real\\nlife is a greater thing than the peerless beauty of Narath with its\\nhundred carven gates and domes of chalcedony, which he dimly remembered\\nfrom his dreams; and under their guidance he cultivated a painstaking\\nsense of pity and tragedy.\\n\\nOnce in a while, though, he could not help seeing how shallow, fickle,\\nand meaningless all human aspirations are, and how emptily our real\\nimpulses contrast with those pompous ideals we profess to hold. Then\\nhe would have recourse to the polite laughter they had taught him to\\nuse against the extravagance and artificiality of dreams; for he saw\\nthat the daily life of our world is every inch as extravagant and\\nartificial, and far less worthy of respect because of its poverty in\\nbeauty and its silly reluctance to admit its own lack of reason and\\npurpose. In this way he became a kind of humorist, for he did not see\\nthat even humor is empty in a mindless universe devoid of any true\\nstandard of consistency or inconsistency.\\n\\nIn the first days of his bondage he had turned to the gentle churchly\\nfaith endeared to him by the naÃ¯ve trust of his fathers, for thence\\nstretched mystic avenues which seemed to promise escape from life. Only\\non closer view did he mark the starved fancy and beauty, the stale and\\nprosy triteness, and the owlish gravity and grotesque claims of solid\\ntruth which reigned boresomely and overwhelmingly among most of its\\nprofessors; or feel to the full the awkwardness with which it sought to\\nkeep alive as literal fact the outgrown fears and guesses of a primal\\nrace confronting the unknown. It wearied Carter to see how solemnly\\npeople tried to make earthly reality out of old myths which every step\\nof their boasted science confuted, and this misplaced seriousness\\nkilled the attachment he might have kept for the ancient creeds had\\nthey been content to offer the sonorous rites and emotional outlets in\\ntheir true guise of ethereal fantasy.\\n\\nBut when he came to study those who had thrown off the old myths,\\nhe found them even more ugly than those who had not. They did not\\nknow that beauty lies in harmony, and that loveliness of life has no\\nstandard amidst an aimless cosmos save only its harmony with the\\ndreams and the feelings which have gone before and blindly molded our\\nlittle spheres out of the rest of chaos. They did not see that good and\\nevil and beauty and ugliness are only ornamental fruits of perspective,\\nwhose sole value lies in their linkage to what chance made our fathers\\nthink and feel, and whose fine details are different for every race\\nand culture. Instead, they either denied these things altogether or\\ntransferred them to the crude, vague instincts which they shared with\\nthe beasts and peasants; so that their lives were dragged malodorously\\nout in pain, ugliness, and disproportion, yet filled with a ludicrous\\npride at having escaped from something no more unsound than that which\\nstill held them. They had traded the false gods of fear and blind piety\\nfor those of license and anarchy.\\n\\nCarter did not taste deeply of these modern freedoms; for their\\ncheapness and squalor sickened a spirit loving beauty alone, while\\nhis reason rebelled at the flimsy logic with which their champions\\ntried to gild brute impulse with a sacredness stripped from the idols\\nthey had discarded. He saw that most of them, in common with their\\ncast-off priestcraft, could not escape from the delusion that life\\nhas a meaning apart from that which men dream into it; and could not\\nlay aside the crude notion of ethics and obligations beyond those\\nof beauty, even when all Nature shrieked of its unconsciousness and\\nimpersonal unmorality in the light of their scientific discoveries.\\nWarped and bigoted with preconceived illusions of justice, freedom,\\nand consistency, they cast off the old lore and the old ways with the\\nold beliefs; nor ever stopped to think that that lore and those ways\\nwere the sole makers of their present thoughts and judgments, and the\\nsole guides and standards in a meaningless universe without fixed\\naims or stable points of reference. Having lost these artificial\\nsettings, their lives grew void of direction and dramatic interest;\\ntill at length they strove to drown their ennui in bustle and pretended\\nusefulness, noise and excitement, barbaric display and animal\\nsensation. When these things palled, disappointed, or grew nauseous\\nthrough revulsion, they cultivated irony and bitterness, and found\\nfault with the social order. Never could they realize that their brute\\nfoundations were as shifting and contradictory as the gods of their\\nelders, and that the satisfaction of one moment is the bane of the\\nnext. Calm, lasting beauty comes only in dream, and this solace the\\nworld had thrown away when in its worship of the real it threw away the\\nsecrets of childhood and innocence.\\n\\nAmidst this chaos of hollowness and unrest Carter tried to live as\\nbefitted a man of keen thought and good heritage. With his dreams\\nfading under the ridicule of the age he could not believe in anything,\\nbut the love of harmony kept him close to the ways of his race and\\nstation. He walked impassive through the cities of men, and sighed\\nbecause no vista seemed fully real; because every flash of yellow\\nsunlight on tall roofs and every glimpse of balustraded plazas in the\\nfirst lamps of evening served only to remind him of dreams he had once\\nknown, and to make him homesick for ethereal lands he no longer knew\\nhow to find. Travel was only a mockery; and even the Great War stirred\\nhim but little, though he served from the first in the Foreign Legion\\nof France. For a while he sought friends, but soon grew weary of the\\ncrudeness of their emotions, and the sameness and earthiness of their\\nvisions. He felt vaguely glad that all his relatives were distant and\\nout of touch with him, for they could not have understood his mental\\nlife. That is, none but his grandfather and great-uncle Christopher\\ncould, and they were long dead.\\n\\nThen he began once more the writing of books, which he had left off\\nwhen dreams first failed him. But here, too, was there no satisfaction\\nor fulfilment; for the touch of earth was upon his mind, and he could\\nnot think of lovely things as he had done of yore. Ironic humor\\ndragged down all the twilight minarets he reared, and the earthy fear\\nof improbability blasted all the delicate and amazing flowers in his\\nfaery gardens. The convention of assumed piety spilt mawkishness on\\nhis characters, while the myth of an important reality and significant\\nhuman events and emotions debased all his high fantasy into thin-veiled\\nallegory and cheap social satire. His new novels were successful as his\\nold ones had never been; and because he knew how empty they must be to\\nplease an empty herd, he burned them and ceased his writing. They were\\nvery graceful novels, in which he urbanely laughed at the dreams he\\nlightly sketched; but he saw that their sophistication had sapped all\\ntheir life away.\\n\\nIt was after this that he cultivated deliberate illusion, and dabbled\\nin the notions of the bizarre and the eccentric as an antidote for the\\ncommonplace. Most of these, however, soon showed their poverty and\\nbarrenness; and he saw that the popular doctrines of occultism are as\\ndry and inflexible as those of science, yet without even the slender\\npalliative of truth to redeem them. Gross stupidity, falsehood, and\\nmuddled thinking are not dream; and form no escape from life to a mind\\ntrained above their level. So Carter bought stranger books and sought\\nout deeper and more terrible men of fantastic erudition; delving into\\narcana of consciousness that few have trod, and learning things about\\nthe secret pits of life, legend, and immemorial antiquity which\\ndisturbed him ever afterward. He decided to live on a rarer plane, and\\nfurnished his Boston home to suit his changing moods; one room for\\neach, hung in appropriate colors, furnished with befitting books and\\nobjects, and provided with sources of the proper sensations of light,\\nheat, sound, taste, and odor.\\n\\nOnce he heard of a man in the South who was shunned and feared for\\nthe blasphemous things he read in prehistoric books and clay tablets\\nsmuggled from India and Arabia. Him he visited, living with him and\\nsharing his studies for seven years, till horror overtook them one\\nmidnight in an unknown and archaic graveyard, and only one emerged\\nwhere two had entered. Then he went back to Arkham, the terrible\\nwitch-haunted old town of his forefathers in New England, and had\\nexperiences in the dark, amidst the hoary willows and tottering gambrel\\nroofs, which made him seal for ever certain pages in the diary of a\\nwild-minded ancestor. But these horrors took him only to the edge of\\nreality, and were not of the true dream country he had known in youth;\\nso that at fifty he despaired of any rest or contentment in a world\\ngrown too busy for beauty and too shrewd for dream.\\n\\nHaving perceived at last the hollowness and futility of real things,\\nCarter spent his days in retirement, and in wistful disjointed memories\\nof his dream-filled youth. He thought it rather silly that he bother\\nto keep on living at all, and got from a South American acquaintance\\na very curious liquid to take him to oblivion without suffering.\\nInertia and force of habit, however, caused him to defer action; and\\nhe lingered indecisively among thoughts of old times, taking down the\\nstrange hangings from his walls and refitting the house as it was in\\nhis early boyhoodâ\\x80\\x94purple panes, Victorian furniture, and all.\\n\\nWith the passage of time he became almost glad he had lingered, for\\nhis relics of youth and his cleavage from the world made life and\\nsophistication seem very distant and unreal; so much so that a touch of\\nmagic and expectancy stole back into his nightly slumbers. For years\\nthose slumbers had known only such twisted reflections of every-day\\nthings as the commonest slumbers know, but now there returned a\\nflicker of something stranger and wilder; something of vaguely awesome\\nimmanence which took the form of tensely clear pictures from his\\nchildhood days, and made him think of little inconsequential things he\\nhad long forgotten. He would often awake calling for his mother and\\ngrandfather, both in their graves a quarter of a century.\\n\\nThen one night his grandfather reminded him of the key. The gray\\nold scholar, as vivid as in life, spoke long and earnestly of their\\nancient line, and of the strange visions of the delicate and sensitive\\nmen who composed it. He spoke of the flame-eyed Crusader who learnt\\nwild secrets of the Saracens that held him captive; and of the first\\nSir Randolph Carter who studied magic when Elizabeth was queen. He\\nspoke, too, of that Edmund Carter who had just escaped hanging in the\\nSalem witchcraft, and who had placed in an antique box a great silver\\nkey handed down from his ancestors. Before Carter awaked, the gentle\\nvisitant had told him where to find that box; that carved oak-box of\\narchaic wonder whose grotesque lid no hand had raised for two centuries.\\n\\nIn the dust and shadows of the great attic he found it, remote and\\nforgotten at the back of a drawer in a tall chest. It was about a foot\\nsquare, and its Gothic carvings were so fearful that he did not marvel\\nno person since Edmund Carter had dared open it. It gave forth no noise\\nwhen shaken, but was mystic with the scent of unremembered spices. That\\nit held a key was indeed only a dim legend, and Randolph Carter\\'s\\nfather had never known such a box existed. It was bound in rusty iron,\\nand no means was provided for working the formidable lock. Carter\\nvaguely understood that he would find within it some key to the lost\\ngate of dreams, but of where and how to use it his grandfather had told\\nhim nothing.\\n\\nAn old servant forced the carven lid, shaking as he did so at the\\nhideous faces leering from the blackened wood, and at some unplaced\\nfamiliarity. Inside, wrapped in a discolored parchment, was a huge\\nkey of tarnished silver covered with cryptical arabesques; but of any\\nlegible explanation there was none. The parchment was voluminous, and\\nheld only the strange hieroglyphs of an unknown tongue written with an\\nantique reed. Carter recognized the characters as those he had seen\\non a certain papyrus scroll belonging to that terrible scholar of the\\nSouth who had vanished one midnight in a nameless cemetery. The man had\\nalways shivered when he read this scroll, and Carter shivered now.\\n\\nBut he cleaned the key, and kept it by him nightly in its aromatic box\\nof ancient oak. His dreams were meanwhile increasing in vividness, and\\nthough showing him none of the strange cities and incredible gardens\\nof the old days, were assuming a definite cast whose purpose could not\\nbe mistaken. They were calling him back along the years, and with the\\nmingled wills of all his fathers were pulling him toward some hidden\\nand ancestral source. Then he knew he must go into the past and merge\\nhimself with old things, and day after day he thought of the hills\\nto the north where haunted Arkham and the rushing Miskatonic and the\\nlonely rustic homestead of his people lay.\\n\\nIn the brooding fire of autumn Carter took the old remembered way past\\ngraceful lines of rolling hill and stone-walled meadow, distant vale\\nand hanging woodland, curving road and nestling farmstead, and the\\ncrystal windings of the Miskatonic, crossed here and there by rustic\\nbridges of wood or stone. At one bend he saw a group of giant elms\\namong which an ancestor had oddly vanished a century and a half before,\\nand shuddered as the wind blew meaningly through them. Then there was\\nthe crumbling farmhouse of old Goody Fowler the witch, with its little\\nevil windows and great roof sloping nearly to the ground on the north\\nside. He speeded up his car as he passed it, and did not slacken till\\nhe had mounted the hill where his mother and her fathers before her\\nwere born, and where the old white house still looked proudly across\\nthe road at the breathlessly lovely panorama of rocky slope and verdant\\nvalley, with the distant spires of Kingsport on the horizon, and hints\\nof the archaic, dream-laden sea in the farthest background.\\n\\nThen came the steeper slope that held the old Carter place he had not\\nseen in over forty years. Afternoon was far gone when he reached the\\nfoot, and at the bend half-way up he paused to scan the outspread\\ncountryside golden and glorified in the slanting floods of magic poured\\nout by a western sun. All the strangeness and expectancy of his recent\\ndreams seemed present in this hushed and unearthly landscape, and he\\nthought of the unknown solitudes of other planets as his eyes traced\\nout the velvet and deserted lawns shining undulant between their\\ntumbled walls, the clumps of faery forest setting off far lines of\\npurple hills beyond hills, and the spectral wooded valley dipping down\\nin shadow to dank hollows where trickling waters crooned and gurgled\\namong swollen and distorted roots.\\n\\nSomething made him feel that motors did not belong in the realm he was\\nseeking, so he left his car at the edge of the forest, and putting the\\ngreat key in his coat pocket walked on up the hill. Woods now engulfed\\nhim utterly, though he knew the house was on a high knoll that cleared\\nthe trees except to the north. He wondered how it would look, for it\\nhad been left vacant and untended through his neglect since the death\\nof his strange great-uncle Christopher thirty years before. In his\\nboyhood he had reveled through long visits there, and had found weird\\nmarvels in the woods beyond the orchard.\\n\\nShadows thickened around him, for the night was near. Once a gap in\\nthe trees opened up to the right, so that he saw off across leagues of\\ntwilight meadow and spied the old Congregational steeple on Central\\nHill in Kingsport; pink with the last flush of day, the panes of the\\nlittle round windows blazing with reflected fire. Then, when he was in\\ndeep shadow again, he recalled with a start that the glimpse must have\\ncome from childish memory alone, since the old white church had long\\nbeen torn down to make room for the Congregational Hospital. He had\\nread of it with interest, for the paper had told about some strange\\nburrows or passages found in the rocky hill beneath.\\n\\nThrough his puzzlement a voice piped, and he started again at its\\nfamiliarity after long years. Old Benijah Corey had been his Uncle\\nChristopher\\'s hired man, and was aged even in those far-off times of\\nhis boyhood visits. Now he must be well over a hundred, but that piping\\nvoice could come from no one else. He could distinguish no words, yet\\nthe tone was haunting and unmistakable. To think that \"Old Benijy\"\\nshould still be alive!\\n\\n\"Mister Randy! Mister Randy! Whar be ye? D\\'ye want to skeer yer Aunt\\nMarthy plumb to death? Hain\\'t she tuld ye to keep nigh the place in\\nthe arternoon an\\' git back afur dark? Randy! Ranâ\\x80\\x94dee!... He\\'s the\\nbeatin\\'est boy fer runnin\\' off in the woods I ever see; haff the time\\na-settin\\' moonin\\' raound that snake-den in the upper timber-lot!...\\nHey, yew, Ranâ\\x80\\x94dee!\"\\n\\nRandolph Carter stopped in the pitch darkness and rubbed his hand\\nacross his eyes. Something was queer. He had been somewhere he ought\\nnot to be; had strayed very far away to places where he had not\\nbelonged, and was now inexcusably late. He had not noticed the time on\\nthe Kingsport steeple, though he could easily have made it out with\\nhis pocket telescope; but he knew his lateness was something very\\nstrange and unprecedented. He was not sure he had his little telescope\\nwith him, and put his hand in his blouse pocket to see. No, it was\\nnot there, but there was the big silver key he had found in a box\\nsomewhere. Uncle Chris had told him something odd once about an old\\nunopened box with a key in it, but Aunt Martha had stopped the story\\nabruptly, saying it was no kind of thing to tell a child whose head was\\nalready too full of queer fancies. He tried to recall just where he\\nhad found the key, but something seemed very confused. He guessed it\\nwas in the attic at home in Boston, and dimly remembered bribing Parks\\nwith half his week\\'s allowance to help him open the box and keep quiet\\nabout it; but when he remembered this, the face of Parks came up very\\nstrangely, as if the wrinkles of long years had fallen upon the brisk\\nlittle cockney.\\n\\n\"Ranâ\\x80\\x94dee! Ranâ\\x80\\x94dee! Hi! Hi! Randy!\"\\n\\nA swaying lantern came around the black bend, and old Benijah pounced\\non the silent and bewildered form of the pilgrim.\\n\\n\"Durn ye, boy, so thar ye be! Ain\\'t ye got a tongue in yer head, that\\nye can\\'t answer a body? I ben callin\\' this haff hour, an\\' ye must a\\nheerd me long ago! Don\\'t ye know yer Aunt Marthy\\'s all a-fidget over\\nyer bein\\' off arter dark? Wait till I tell yer Uncle Chris when he\\ngets hum! Ye\\'d orta know these here woods ain\\'t no fitten place to be\\ntraipsin\\' this hour! They\\'s things abroad what dun\\'t do nobody no good,\\nas my gran\\'sir\\' knowed afur me. Come, Mister Randy, or Hannah wun\\'t\\nkeep supper no longer!\"\\n\\nSo Randolph Carter was marched up the road where wondering stars\\nglimmered through high autumn boughs. And dogs barked as the yellow\\nlight of small-paned windows shone out at the farther turn, and the\\nPleiades twinkled across the open knoll where a great gambrel roof\\nstood black against the dim west. Aunt Martha was in the doorway, and\\ndid not scold too hard when Benijah shoved the truant in. She knew\\nUncle Chris well enough to expect such things of the Carter blood.\\nRandolph did not show his key, but ate his supper in silence and\\nprotested only when bedtime came. He sometimes dreamed better when\\nawake, and he wanted to use that key.\\n\\nIn the morning Randolph was up early, and would have run off to the\\nupper timber-lot if Uncle Chris had not caught him and forced him\\ninto his chair by the breakfast table. He looked impatiently around\\nthe low-pitched room with the rag carpet and exposed beams and\\ncorner-posts, and smiled only when the orchard boughs scratched at the\\nlittle leaded panes of the rear window. The trees and the hills were\\nclose to him, and formed the gates of that timeless realm which was his\\ntrue country.\\n\\nThen, when he was free, he felt in his blouse pocket for the key; and\\nbeing reassured, skipped off across the orchard to the rise beyond,\\nwhere the wooded hill climbed again to heights above even the treeless\\nknoll. The floor of the forest was mossy and mysterious, and great\\nlichened rocks rose vaguely here and there in the dim light like druid\\nmonoliths among the swollen and twisted trunks of a sacred grove. Once\\nin his ascent Randolph crossed a rushing stream whose falls a little\\nway off sang runic incantations to the lurking fauns and Ã¦gipans and\\ndryads.\\n\\nThen he came to the strange cave in the forest slope, the dreaded\\n\"snake-den\" which country folk shunned, and away from which Benijah had\\nwarned him again and again. It was deep; far deeper than anyone but\\nRandolph suspected, for the boy had found a fissure in the farthermost\\nblack corner that led to a loftier grotto beyondâ\\x80\\x94a haunting sepulchral\\nplace whose granite walls held a curious illusion of conscious\\nartifice. On this occasion he crawled in as usual, lighting his way\\nwith matches filched from the sitting-room match-safe, and edging\\nthrough the final crevice with an eagerness hard to explain even to\\nhimself. He could not tell why he approached the farther wall so\\nconfidently, or why he instinctively drew forth the great silver key as\\nhe did so. But on he went, and when he danced back to the house that\\nnight he offered no excuses for his lateness, nor heeded in the least\\nthe reproofs he gained for ignoring the noontide dinner-horn altogether.\\n\\nNow it is agreed by all the distant relatives of Randolph Carter that\\nsomething occurred to heighten his imagination in his tenth year. His\\ncousin, Ernest B. Aspinwall, Esq., of Chicago, is fully ten years his\\nsenior and distinctly recalls a change in the boy after the autumn of\\n1883. Randolph had looked on scenes of fantasy that few others can\\never have beheld, and stranger still were some of the qualities which\\nhe showed in relation to very mundane things. He seemed, in fine, to\\nhave picked up an odd gift of prophecy; and reacted unusually to things\\nwhich, though at the time without meaning, were later found to justify\\nthe singular impressions. In subsequent decades as new inventions,\\nnew names, and new events appeared one by one in the book of history,\\npeople would now and then recall wonderingly how Carter had years\\nbefore let fall some careless word of undoubted connection with what\\nwas then far in the future. He did not himself understand these words,\\nor know why certain things made him feel certain emotions; but fancied\\nthat some unremembered dream must be responsible. It was as early as\\n1897 that he turned pale when some traveler mentioned the French town\\nof Belloy-en-Santerre, and friends remembered it when he was almost\\nmortally wounded there in 1916, while serving with the Foreign Legion\\nin the Great War.\\n\\nCarter\\'s relatives talk much of these things because he has lately\\ndisappeared. His little old servant Parks, who for years bore patiently\\nwith his vagaries, last saw him on the morning he drove off alone in\\nhis car with a key he had recently found. Parks had helped him get the\\nkey from the old box containing it, and had felt strangely affected by\\nthe grotesque carvings on the box, and by some other odd quality he\\ncould not name. When Carter left, he had said he was going to visit his\\nold ancestral country around Arkham.\\n\\nHalf-way up Elm Mountain, on the way to the ruins of the old Carter\\nplace, they found his motor set carefully by the roadside; and in it\\nwas a box of fragrant wood with carvings that frightened the countrymen\\nwho stumbled on it. The box held only a queer parchment whose\\ncharacters no linguist or paleographer has been able to decipher or\\nidentify. Rain had long effaced any possible footprints, though Boston\\ninvestigators had something to say about evidences of disturbances\\namong the fallen timbers of the Carter place. It was, they averred,\\nas though someone had groped about the ruins at no distant period. A\\ncommon white handkerchief found among the forest rocks on the hillside\\nbeyond can not be identified as belonging to the missing man.\\n\\nThere is talk of apportioning Randolph Carter\\'s estate among his heirs,\\nbut I shall stand firmly against this course because I do not believe\\nhe is dead. There are twists of time and space, of vision and reality,\\nwhich only a dreamer can divine; and from what I know of Carter I think\\nhe has merely found a way to traverse these mazes. Whether or not he\\nwill ever come back, I can not say. He wanted the lands of dreams he\\nhad lost, and yearned for the days of his childhood. Then he found a\\nkey, and I somehow believe he was able to use it to strange advantage.\\n\\n\"There the bearded and finny Gnorri build their labyrinths.\"\\n\\nI shall ask him when I see him, for I expect to meet him shortly in\\na certain dream-city we both used to haunt. It is rumored in Ulthar,\\nbeyond the River Skai, that a new king reigns on the opal throne of\\nIlek-Vad, that fabulous town of turrets atop the hollow cliffs of glass\\noverlooking the twilight sea wherein the bearded and finny Gnorri build\\ntheir singular labyrinths, and I believe I know how to interpret this\\nrumor. Certainly, I look forward impatiently to the sight of that great\\nsilver key, for in its cryptical arabesques there may stand symbolized\\nall the aims and mysteries of a blindly impersonal cosmos.',\n",

The ground gets higher, and\\nthe brier-bordered stone walls press closer and closer against the ruts\\nof the dusty, curving road. The trees of the frequent forest belts\\nseem too large, and the wild weeds, brambles, and grasses attain a\\nluxuriance not often found in settled regions. At the same time the\\nplanted fields appear singularly few and barren; while the sparsely\\nscattered houses wear a surprizing uniform aspect of age, squalor, and\\ndilapidation. Without knowing why, one hesitates to ask directions\\nfrom the gnarled, solitary figures spied now and then on crumbling\\ndoorsteps or in the sloping, rock-strewn meadows. Those figures are\\nso silent and furtive that one feels somehow confronted by forbidden\\nthings, with which it would be better to have nothing to do. When a\\nrise in the road brings the mountains in view above the deep woods,\\nthe feeling of strange uneasiness is increased. The summits are too\\nrounded and symmetrical to give a sense of comfort and naturalness, and\\nsometimes the sky silhouettes with especial clearness the queer circles\\nof tall stone pillars with which most of them are crowned.\\n\\nGorges and ravines of problematical depth intersect the way, and the\\ncrude wooden bridges always seem of dubious safety. When the road\\ndips again there are stretches of marshland that one instinctively\\ndislikes, and indeed almost fears at evening when unseen whippoorwills\\nchatter and the fireflies come out in abnormal profusion to dance to\\nthe raucous, creepily insistent rhythms of stridently piping bullfrogs.\\nThe thin, shining line of the Miskatonic\\'s upper reaches has an oddly\\nserpentlike suggestion as it winds close to the feet of the domed hills\\namong which it rises.\\n\\nAs the hills draw nearer, one heeds their wooded sides more than their\\nstone-crowned tops. Those sides loom up so darkly and precipitously\\nthat one wishes they would keep their distance, but there is no road by\\nwhich to escape them. Across a covered bridge one sees a small village\\nhuddled between the stream and the vertical slope of Round Mountain,\\nand wonders at the cluster of rotting gambrel roofs bespeaking an\\nearlier architectural period than that of the neighboring region. It\\nis not reassuring to see, on a closer glance, that most of the houses\\nare deserted and falling to ruin, and that the broken-steepled church\\nnow harbors the one slovenly mercantile establishment of the hamlet.\\nOne dreads to trust the tenebrous tunnel of the bridge, yet there is no\\nway to avoid it. Once across, it is hard to prevent the impression of a\\nfaint, malign odor about the village street, as of the massed mold and\\ndecay of centuries. It is always a relief to get clear of the place,\\nand to follow the narrow road around the base of the hills and across\\nthe level country beyond till it rejoins the Aylesbury pike. Afterward\\none sometimes learns that one has been through Dunwich.\\n\\nOutsiders visit Dunwich as seldom as possible, and since a certain\\nseason of horror all the signboards pointing toward it have been taken\\ndown. The scenery, judged by any ordinary esthetic canon, is more\\nthan commonly beautiful; yet there is no influx of artists or summer\\ntourists. Two centuries ago, when talk of witch-blood, Satan-worship,\\nand strange forest presences was not laughed at, it was the custom to\\ngive reasons for avoiding the locality. In our sensible ageâ\\x80\\x94since\\nthe Dunwich horror of 1928 was hushed up by those who had the town\\'s\\nand the world\\'s welfare at heartâ\\x80\\x94people shun it without knowing\\nexactly why. Perhaps one reasonâ\\x80\\x94though it can not apply to uninformed\\nstrangersâ\\x80\\x94is that the natives are now repellently decadent, having\\ngone far along that path of retrogression so common in many New England\\nbackwaters. They have come to form a race by themselves, with the\\nwell-defined mental and physical stigmata of degeneracy and inbreeding.\\nThe average of their intelligence is wofully low, whilst their annals\\nreek of overt viciousness and of half-hidden murders, incests, and\\ndeeds of almost unnamable violence and perversity. The old gentry,\\nrepresenting the two or three armigerous families which came from\\nSalem in 1692, have kept somewhat above the general level of decay;\\nthough many branches are sunk into the sordid populace so deeply that\\nonly their names remain as a key to the origin they disgrace. Some of\\nthe Whateleys and Bishops still send their eldest sons to Harvard and\\nMiskatonic, though those sons seldom return to the moldering gambrel\\nroofs under which they and their ancestors were born.\\n\\nNo one, even those who have the facts concerning the recent horror,\\ncan say just what is the matter with Dunwich; though old legends speak\\nof unhallowed rites and conclaves of the Indians, amidst which they\\ncalled forbidden shapes of shadow out of the great rounded hills, and\\nmade wild orgiastic prayers that were answered by loud crackings and\\nrumblings from the ground below. In 1747 the Reverend Abijah Hoadley,\\nnewly come to the Congregational Church at Dunwich Village, preached a\\nmemorable sermon on the close presence of Satan and his imps, in which\\nhe said:\\n\\nIt must be allow\\'d that these Blasphemies of an infernall Train of\\nDÃ¦mons are Matters of too common Knowledge to be deny\\'d; the cursed\\nVoices of Azazel and Buzrael , of Beelzebub and Belial , being\\nheard from under Ground by above a Score of credible Witnesses now\\nliving. I myself did not more than a Fortnight ago catch a very plain\\nDiscourse of evill Powers in the Hill behind my House; wherein there\\nwere a Rattling and Rolling, Groaning, Screeching, and Hissing, such\\nas no Things of this Earth cou\\'d raise up, and which must needs have\\ncome from those Caves that only black Magick can discover, and only\\nthe Divell unlock.\\n\\nMr. Hoadley disappeared soon after delivering this sermon; but the\\ntext, printed in Springfield, is still extant. Noises in the hills\\ncontinued to be reported from year to year, and still form a puzzle to\\ngeologists and physiographers.\\n\\nOther traditions tell of foul odors near the hill-crowning circles of\\nstone pillars, and of rushing airy presences to be heard faintly at\\ncertain hours from stated points at the bottom of the great ravines;\\nwhile still others try to explain the Devil\\'s Hop Yardâ\\x80\\x94a bleak,\\nblasted hillside where no tree, shrub, or grass-blade will grow. Then,\\ntoo, the natives are mortally afraid of the numerous whippoorwills\\nwhich grow vocal on warm nights. It is vowed that the birds are\\npsychopomps lying in wait for the souls of the dying, and that they\\ntime their eery cries in unison with the sufferer\\'s struggling breath.\\nIf they can catch the fleeing soul when it leaves the body, they\\ninstantly flutter away chittering in demoniac laughter; but if they\\nfail, they subside gradually into a disappointed silence.\\n\\nThese tales, of course, are obsolete and ridiculous; because they come\\ndown from very old times. Dunwich is indeed ridiculously oldâ\\x80\\x94older by\\nfar than any of the communities within thirty miles of it. South of the\\nvillage one may still spy the cellar walls and chimney of the ancient\\nBishop house, which was built before 1700; whilst the ruins of the mill\\nat the falls, built in 1806, form the most modern piece of architecture\\nto be seen. Industry did not flourish here, and the Nineteenth Century\\nfactory movement proved short-lived. Oldest of all are the great\\nrings of rough-hewn stone columns on the hilltops, but these are more\\ngenerally attributed to the Indians than to the settlers. Deposits of\\nskulls and bones, found within these circles and around the sizable\\ntable-like rock on Sentinel Hill, sustain the popular belief that such\\nspots were once the burial-places of the Pocumtucks; even though many\\nethnologists, disregarding the absurd improbability of such a theory,\\npersist in believing the remains Caucasian.\\n\\n2\\n\\nIt was in the township of Dunwich, in a large and partly inhabited\\nfarmhouse set against a hillside four miles from the village and a mile\\nand a half from any other dwelling, that Wilbur Whateley was born at 5\\na. m. on Sunday, the second of February, 1913. This date was recalled\\nbecause it was Candlemas, which people in Dunwich curiously observe\\nunder another name; and because the noises in the hills had sounded,\\nand all the dogs of the countryside had barked persistently, throughout\\nthe night before. Less worthy of notice was the fact that the mother\\nwas one of the decadent Whateleys, a somewhat deformed, unattractive\\nalbino woman of 35, living with an aged and half-insane father\\nabout whom the most frightful tales of wizardry had been whispered\\nin his youth. Lavinia Whateley had no known husband, but according\\nto the custom of the region made no attempt to disavow the child;\\nconcerning the other side of whose ancestry the country folk mightâ\\x80\\x94and\\ndidâ\\x80\\x94speculate as widely as they chose. On the contrary, she seemed\\nstrangely proud of the dark, goatish-looking infant who formed such a\\ncontrast to her own sickly and pink-eyed albinism, and was heard to\\nmutter many curious prophecies about its unusual powers and tremendous\\nfuture.\\n\\nLavinia was one who would be apt to mutter such things, for she was a\\nlone creature given to wandering amidst thunderstorms in the hills and\\ntrying to read the great odorous books which her father had inherited\\nthrough two centuries of Whateleys, and which were fast falling to\\npieces with age and worm-holes. She had never been to school, but was\\nfilled with disjointed scraps of ancient lore that Old Whateley had\\ntaught her. The remote farmhouse had always been feared because of Old\\nWhateley\\'s reputation for black magic, and the unexplained death by\\nviolence of Mrs. Whateley when Lavinia was twelve years old had not\\nhelped to make the place popular. Isolated among strange influences,\\nLavinia was fond of wild and grandiose daydreams and singular\\noccupations; nor was her leisure much taken up by household cares in a\\nhome from which all standards of order and cleanliness had long since\\ndisappeared.\\n\\nThere was a hideous screaming which echoed above even the hill noises\\nand the dogs\\' barking on the night Wilbur was born, but no known doctor\\nor midwife presided at his coming. Neighbors knew nothing of him till\\na week afterward, when Old Whateley drove his sleigh through the snow\\ninto Dunwich Village and discoursed incoherently to the group of\\nloungers at Osborn\\'s general store. There seemed to be a change in the\\nold manâ\\x80\\x94an added element of furtiveness in the clouded brain which\\nsubtly transformed him from an object to a subject of fearâ\\x80\\x94though he\\nwas not one to be perturbed by any common family event. Amidst it all\\nhe showed some trace of the pride later noticed in his daughter, and\\nwhat he said of the child\\'s paternity was remembered by many of his\\nhearers years afterward.\\n\\n\"I dun\\'t keer what folks thinkâ\\x80\\x94ef Lavinny\\'s boy looked like his pa, he\\nwouldn\\'t look like nothin\\' ye expeck. Ye needn\\'t think the only folks\\nis the folks hereabouts. Lavinny\\'s read some, an\\' has seed some things\\nthe most o\\' ye only tell abaout. I calc\\'late her man is as good a\\nhusban\\' as ye kin find this side of Aylesbury; an\\' ef ye knowed as much\\nabaout the hills as I dew, ye wouldn\\'t ast no better church weddin\\' nor\\nher\\'n. Let me tell ye suthin\\'â\\x80\\x94 some day yew folks\\'ll hear a child o\\'\\nLavinny\\'s a-callin\\' its father\\'s name on the top o\\' Sentinel Hill! \"\\n\\nThe only persons who saw Wilbur during the first month of his life\\nwere old Zechariah Whateley, of the undecayed Whateleys, and Earl\\nSawyer\\'s common-law wife, Mamie Bishop. Mamie\\'s visit was frankly one\\nof curiosity, and her subsequent tales did justice to her observations;\\nbut Zechariah came to lead a pair of Alderney cows which Old Whateley\\nhad bought of his son Curtis. This marked the beginning of a course of\\ncattle-buying on the part of small Wilbur\\'s family which ended only\\nin 1928, when the Dunwich horror came and went; yet at no time did\\nthe ramshackle Whateley barn seem over-crowded with livestock. There\\ncame a period when people were curious enough to steal up and count\\nthe herd that grazed precariously on the steep hillside above the old\\nfarmhouse, and they could never find more than ten or twelve anemic,\\nbloodless-looking specimens. Evidently some blight or distemper,\\nperhaps sprung from the unwholesome pasturage or the diseased fungi\\nand timbers of the filthy barn, caused a heavy mortality amongst the\\nWhateley animals. Odd wounds or sores, having something of the aspect\\nof incisions, seemed to afflict the visible cattle; and once or twice\\nduring the earlier months certain callers fancied they could discern\\nsimilar sores about the throats of the gray, unshaven old man and his\\nslatternly, crinkly-haired albino daughter.\\n\\nIn the spring after Wilbur\\'s birth Lavinia resumed her customary\\nrambles in the hills, bearing in her misproportioned arms the swarthy\\nchild. Public interest in the Whateleys subsided after most of the\\ncountry folk had seen the baby, and no one bothered to comment on the\\nswift development which that newcomer seemed every day to exhibit.\\nWilbur\\'s growth was indeed phenomenal, for within three months of his\\nbirth he had attained a size and muscular power not usually found in\\ninfants under a full year of age. His motions and even his vocal sounds\\nshowed a restraint and deliberateness highly peculiar in an infant,\\nand no one was really unprepared when, at seven months, he began to\\nwalk unassisted, with falterings which another month was sufficient to\\nremove.\\n\\nIt was somewhat after this timeâ\\x80\\x94on Hallowe\\'enâ\\x80\\x94that a great blaze was\\nseen at midnight on the top of Sentinel Hill where the old table-like\\nstone stands amidst its tumulus of ancient bones. Considerable talk\\nwas started when Silas Bishopâ\\x80\\x94of the undecayed Bishopsâ\\x80\\x94mentioned\\nhaving seen the boy running sturdily up that hill ahead of his mother\\nabout an hour before the blaze was remarked. Silas was rounding up a\\nstray heifer, but he nearly forgot his mission when he fleetingly spied\\nthe two figures in the dim light of his lantern. They darted almost\\nnoiselessly through the underbrush, and the astonished watcher seemed\\nto think they were entirely unclothed. Afterward he could not be sure\\nabout the boy, who may have had some kind of a fringed belt and a pair\\nof dark blue trunks or trousers on. Wilbur was never subsequently seen\\nalive and conscious without complete and tightly buttoned attire, the\\ndisarrangement or threatened disarrangement of which always seemed to\\nfill him with anger and alarm. His contrast with his squalid mother and\\ngrandfather in this respect was thought very notable until the horror\\nof 1928 suggested the most valid of reasons.\\n\\nThe next January gossips were mildly interested in the fact that\\n\"Lavinny\\'s black brat\" had commenced to talk, and at the age of only\\neleven months. His speech was somewhat remarkable both because of its\\ndifference from the ordinary accents of the region, and because it\\ndisplayed a freedom from infantile lisping of which many children of\\nthree or four might well be proud. The boy was not talkative, yet when\\nhe spoke he seemed to reflect some elusive element wholly unpossessed\\nby Dunwich and its denizens. The strangeness did not reside in what he\\nsaid, or even in the simple idioms he used; but seemed vaguely linked\\nwith his intonation or with the internal organs that produced the\\nspoken sounds. His facial aspect, too, was remarkable for its maturity;\\nfor though he shared his mother\\'s and grandfather\\'s chinlessness, his\\nfirm and precociously shaped nose united with the expression on his\\nlarge, dark, almost Latin eyes to give him an air of quasi-adulthood\\nand well-nigh preternatural intelligence. He was, however, exceedingly\\nugly despite his appearance of brilliancy; there being something almost\\ngoatish or animalistic about his thick lips, large-pored, yellowish\\nskin, coarse crinkly hair, and oddly elongated ears. He was soon\\ndisliked even more decidedly than his mother and grandsire, and all\\nconjectures about him were spiced with references to the bygone magic\\nof Old Whateley, and how the hills once shook when he shrieked the\\ndreadful name of Yog-Sothoth in the midst of a circle of stones with\\na great book open in his arms before him. Dogs abhorred the boy, and\\nhe was always obliged to take various defensive measures against their\\nbarking menace.\\n\\n3\\n\\nMeanwhile Old Whateley continued to buy cattle without measurably\\nincreasing the size of his herd. He also cut timber and began to\\nrepair the unused parts of his houseâ\\x80\\x94a spacious, peaked-roofed affair\\nwhose rear end was buried entirely in the rocky hillside, and whose\\nthree least-ruined ground-floor rooms had always been sufficient for\\nhimself and his daughter. There must have been prodigious reserves\\nof strength in the old man to enable him to accomplish so much hard\\nlabor; and though he still babbled dementedly at times, his carpentry\\nseemed to show the effects of sound calculation. It had really begun\\nas soon as Wilbur was born, when one of the many tool-sheds had been\\nput suddenly in order, clapboarded, and fitted with a stout fresh lock.\\nNow, in restoring the abandoned upper story of the house, he was a no\\nless thorough craftsman. His mania showed itself only in his tight\\nboarding-up of all the windows in the reclaimed sectionâ\\x80\\x94though many\\ndeclared that it was a crazy thing to bother with the reclamation at\\nall. Less inexplicable was his fitting-up of another downstairs room\\nfor his new grandsonâ\\x80\\x94a room which several callers saw, though no one\\nwas ever admitted to the closely-boarded upper story. This chamber\\nhe lined with tall, firm shelving; along which he began gradually to\\narrange, in apparently careful order, all the rotting ancient books and\\nparts of books which during his own day had been heaped promiscuously\\nin odd corners of the various rooms.\\n\\n\"I made some use of \\'em,\" he would say as he tried to mend a torn\\nblack-letter page with paste prepared on the rusty kitchen stove, \"but\\nthe boy\\'s fitten to make better use of \\'em. He\\'d orter hev \\'em as well\\nsot as he kin for they\\'re goin\\' to be all of his larnin\\'.\"\\n\\nWhen Wilbur was a year and seven months oldâ\\x80\\x94in September of 1914â\\x80\\x94his\\nsize and accomplishments were almost alarming. He had grown as large as\\na child of four, and was a fluent and incredibly intelligent talker.\\nHe ran freely about the fields and hills, and accompanied his mother\\non all her wanderings. At home he would pore diligently over the queer\\npictures and charts in his grandfather\\'s books, while Old Whateley\\nwould instruct and catechize him through long, hushed afternoons. By\\nthis time the restoration of the house was finished, and those who\\nwatched it wondered why one of the upper windows had been made into a\\nsolid plank door. It was a window in the rear of the east gable end,\\nclose against the hill; and no one could imagine why a cleated wooden\\nrunway was built up to it from the ground. About the period of this\\nwork\\'s completion people noticed that the old tool-house, tightly\\nlocked and windowlessly clapboarded since Wilbur\\'s birth, had been\\nabandoned again. The door swung listlessly open, and when Earl Sawyer\\nonce stepped within after a cattle-selling call on Old Whateley he was\\nquite discomposed by the singular odor he encounteredâ\\x80\\x94such a stench,\\nhe averred, as he had never before smelt in all his life except near\\nthe Indian circles on the hills, and which could not come from anything\\nsane or of this earth. But then, the homes and sheds of Dunwich folk\\nhave never been remarkable for olfactory immaculateness.\\n\\nThe following months were void of visible events, save that everyone\\nswore to a slow but steady increase in the mysterious hill noises. On\\nMay Eve of 1915 there were tremors which even the Aylesbury people\\nfelt, whilst the following Hallowe\\'en produced an underground rumbling\\nqueerly synchronized with bursts of flameâ\\x80\\x94\"them witch Whateleys\\'\\ndoin\\'s\"â\\x80\\x94from the summit of Sentinel Hill. Wilbur was growing up\\nuncannily, so that he looked like a boy of ten as he entered his\\nfourth year. He read avidly by himself now; but talked much less than\\nformerly. A settled taciturnity was absorbing him, and for the first\\ntime people began to speak specifically of the dawning look of evil in\\nhis goatish face. He would sometimes mutter an unfamiliar jargon, and\\nchant in bizarre rhythms which chilled the listener with a sense of\\nunexplainable terror. The aversion displayed toward him by dogs had now\\nbecome a matter of wide remark, and he was obliged to carry a pistol\\nin order to traverse the countryside in safety. His occasional use of\\nthe weapon did not enhance his popularity amongst the owners of canine\\nguardians.\\n\\nThe few callers at the house would often find Lavinia alone on the\\nground floor, while odd cries and footsteps resounded in the boarded-up\\nsecond story. She would never tell what her father and the boy were\\ndoing up there, though once she turned pale and displayed an abnormal\\ndegree of fear when a jocose fish-peddler tried the locked door leading\\nto the stairway. That peddler told the store loungers at Dunwich\\nVillage that he thought he heard a horse stamping on that floor above.\\nThe loungers reflected, thinking of the door and runway, and of\\nthe cattle that so swiftly disappeared. Then they shuddered as they\\nrecalled tales of Old Whateley\\'s youth, and of the strange things that\\nare called out of the earth when a bullock is sacrificed at the proper\\ntime to certain heathen gods. It had for some time been noticed that\\ndogs had begun to hate and fear the whole Whateley place as violently\\nas they hated and feared young Wilbur personally.\\n\\nIn 1917 the war came, and Squire Sawyer Whateley, as chairman of the\\nlocal draft board, had hard work finding a quota of young Dunwich men\\nfit even to be sent to a development camp. The government, alarmed at\\nsuch signs of wholesale regional decadence, sent several officers and\\nmedical experts to investigate; conducting a survey which New England\\nnewspaper readers may still recall. It was the publicity attending this\\ninvestigation which set reporters on the track of the Whateleys, and\\ncaused the Boston Globe and Arkham Advertiser to print flamboyant\\nSunday stories of young Wilbur\\'s precociousness, Old Whateley\\'s black\\nmagic, the shelves of strange books, the sealed second story of the\\nancient farmhouse, and the weirdness of the whole region and its hill\\nnoises. Wilbur was four and a half then, and looked like a lad of\\nfifteen. His lip and cheek were fuzzy with a coarse dark down, and his\\nvoice had begun to break. Earl Sawyer went out to the Whateley place\\nwith both sets of reporters and camera men, and called their attention\\nto the queer stench which now seemed to trickle down from the sealed\\nupper spaces. It was, he said, exactly like a smell he had found in the\\ntool-shed abandoned when the house was finally repaired, and like the\\nfaint odors which he sometimes thought he caught near the stone circles\\non the mountains. Dunwich folk read the stories when they appeared, and\\ngrinned over the obvious mistakes. They wondered, too, why the writers\\nmade so much of the fact that Old Whateley always paid for his cattle\\nin gold pieces of extremely ancient date. The Whateleys had received\\ntheir visitors with ill-concealed distaste, though they did not dare\\ncourt further publicity by a violent resistance or refusal to talk.\\n\\n4\\n\\nFor a decade the annals of the Whateleys sink indistinguishably into\\nthe general life of a morbid community used to their queer ways and\\nhardened to their May Eve and All-Hallow orgies. Twice a year they\\nwould light fires on the top of Sentinel Hill, at which times the\\nmountain rumblings would recur with greater and greater violence; while\\nat all seasons there were strange and portentous doings at the lonely\\nfarmhouse. In the course of time callers professed to hear sounds\\nin the sealed upper story even when all the family were downstairs,\\nand they wondered how swiftly or how lingeringly a cow or bullock\\nwas usually sacrificed. There was talk of a complaint to the Society\\nfor the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; but nothing ever came of\\nit, since Dunwich folk are never anxious to call the outside world\\'s\\nattention to themselves.\\n\\nAbout 1923, when Wilbur was a boy of ten whose mind, voice, stature,\\nand bearded face gave all the impressions of maturity, a second great\\nsiege of carpentry went on at the old house. It was all inside the\\nsealed upper part, and from bits of discarded lumber people concluded\\nthat the youth and his grandfather had knocked out all the partitions\\nand even removed the attic floor, leaving only one vast open void\\nbetween the ground story and the peaked roof. They had torn down the\\ngreat central chimney, too, and fitted the rusty range with a flimsy\\noutside tin stove-pipe.\\n\\nIn the spring after this event Old Whateley noticed the growing number\\nof whippoorwills that would come out of Cold Spring Glen to chirp under\\nhis window at night. He seemed to regard the circumstance as one of\\ngreat significance, and told the loungers at Osborn\\'s that he thought\\nhis time had almost come.\\n\\n\"They whistle jest in tune with my breathin\\' naow,\" he said, \"an\\' I\\nguess they\\'re gittin\\' ready to ketch my soul. They know it\\'s a-goin\\'\\naout, an\\' dun\\'t calc\\'late to miss it. Yew\\'ll know, boys, arter I\\'m\\ngone, whether they git me er not. Ef they dew, they\\'ll keep up\\na-singin\\' an\\' laffin\\' till break o\\' day. Ef they dun\\'t, they\\'ll kinder\\nquiet daown like. I expeck them an\\' the souls they hunts fer hev some\\npretty tough tussles sometimes.\"\\n\\nOn Lammas Night, 1924, Dr. Houghton of Aylesbury was hastily summoned\\nby Wilbur Whateley, who had lashed his one remaining horse through the\\ndarkness and telephoned from Osborn\\'s in the village. He found Old\\nWhateley in a very grave state, with a cardiac action and stertorous\\nbreathing that told of an end not far off. The shapeless albino\\ndaughter and oddly bearded grandson stood by the bedside, whilst from\\nthe vacant abyss overhead there came a disquieting suggestion of\\nrhythmical surging or lapping, as of the waves on some level beach. The\\ndoctor, though, was chiefly disturbed by the chattering night birds\\noutside; a seemingly limitless legion of whippoorwills that cried their\\nendless message in repetitions timed diabolically to the wheezing gasps\\nof the dying man. It was uncanny and unnaturalâ\\x80\\x94too much, thought Dr.\\nHoughton, like the whole of the region he had entered so reluctantly in\\nresponse to the urgent call.\\n\\nToward 1 o\\'clock Old Whateley gained consciousness, and interrupted his\\nwheezing to choke out a few words to his grandson.\\n\\n\"More space, Willy, more space soon. Yew growsâ\\x80\\x94an\\' that grows\\nfaster. It\\'ll be ready to sarve ye soon, boy. Open up the gates to\\nYog-Sothoth with the long chant that ye\\'ll find on page 751 of the\\ncomplete edition , an\\' then put a match to the prison. Fire from\\nairth can\\'t burn it nohaow!\"\\n\\nHe was obviously quite mad. After a pause, during which the flock of\\nwhippoorwills outside adjusted their cries to the altered tempo while\\nsome indications of the strange hill noises came from afar off, he\\nadded another sentence or two.\\n\\n\"Feed it reg\\'lar, Willy, an\\' mind the quantity; but dun\\'t let it grow\\ntoo fast fer the place, fer ef it busts quarters or gits aout afore ye\\nopens to Yog-Sothoth, it\\'s all over an\\' no use. Only them from beyont\\nkin make it multiply an\\' work.... Only them, the old uns as wants to\\ncome back....\"\\n\\nBut speech gave place to gasps again, and Lavinia screamed at the\\nway the whippoorwills followed the change. It was the same for more\\nthan an hour, when the final throaty rattle came. Dr. Houghton drew\\nshrunken lids over the glazing gray eyes as the tumult of birds faded\\nimperceptibly to silence. Lavinia sobbed, but Wilbur only chuckled\\nwhilst the hill noises rumbled faintly.\\n\\n\"They didn\\'t git him,\" he muttered in his heavy bass voice.\\n\\nWilbur was by this time a scholar of really tremendous erudition in\\nhis one-sided way, and was quietly known by correspondence to many\\nlibrarians in distant places where rare and forbidden books of old days\\nare kept. He was more and more hated and dreaded around Dunwich because\\nof certain youthful disappearances which suspicion laid vaguely at his\\ndoor; but was always able to silence inquiry through fear or through\\nuse of that fund of old-time gold which still, as in his grandfather\\'s\\ntime, went forth regularly and increasingly for cattle-buying. He\\nwas now tremendously mature of aspect, and his height, having reached\\nthe normal adult limit, seemed inclined to wax beyond that figure. In\\n1925, when a scholarly correspondent from Miskatonic University called\\nupon him one day and departed pale and puzzled, he was fully six and\\nthree-quarters feet tall.\\n\\nThrough all the years Wilbur had treated his half-deformed albino\\nmother with a growing contempt, finally forbidding her to go to the\\nhills with him on May Eve and Hallowmass; and in 1926 the poor creature\\ncomplained to Mamie Bishop of being afraid of him.\\n\\n\"They\\'s more abaout him as I knows than I kin tell ye, Mamie,\" she\\nsaid, \"an\\' naowadays they\\'s more nor what I know myself. I vaow afur\\nGawd, I dun\\'t know what he wants nor what he\\'s a-tryin\\' to dew.\"\\n\\nThat Hallowe\\'en the hill noises sounded louder than ever, and fire\\nburned on Sentinel Hill as usual, but people paid more attention\\nto the rhythmical screaming of vast flocks of unnaturally belated\\nwhippoorwills which seemed to be assembled near the unlighted Whateley\\nfarmhouse. After midnight their shrill notes burst into a kind of\\npandemoniac cachinnation which filled all the countryside, and not\\nuntil dawn did they finally quiet down. Then they vanished, hurrying\\nsouthward where they were fully a month overdue. What this meant, no\\none could quite be certain till later. None of the countryfolk seemed\\nto have diedâ\\x80\\x94but poor Lavinia Whateley, the twisted albino, was never\\nseen again.\\n\\nIn the summer of 1927 Wilbur repaired two sheds in the farmyard and\\nbegan moving his books and effects out to them. Soon afterward Earl\\nSawyer told the loungers at Osborn\\'s that more carpentry was going on\\nin the Whateley farmhouse. Wilbur was closing all the doors and windows\\non the ground floor, and seemed to be taking out partitions as he and\\nhis grandfather had done upstairs four years before. He was living\\nin one of the sheds, and Sawyer thought he seemed unusually worried\\nand tremulous. People generally suspected him of knowing something\\nabout his mother\\'s disappearance, and very few ever approached his\\nneighborhood now. His height had increased to more than seven feet, and\\nshowed no signs of ceasing its development.\\n\\n5\\n\\nThe following winter brought an event no less strange than Wilbur\\'s\\nfirst trip outside the Dunwich region. Correspondence with the Widener\\nLibrary at Harvard, the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris, the British\\nMuseum, the University of Buenos Aires, and the Library of Miskatonic\\nUniversity at Arkham had failed to get him the loan of a book he\\ndesperately wanted; so at length he set out in person, shabby, dirty,\\nbearded, and uncouth of dialect, to consult the copy at Miskatonic,\\nwhich was the nearest to him geographically. Almost eight feet tall,\\nand carrying a cheap new valise from Osborn\\'s general store, this\\ndark and goatish gargoyle appeared one day in Arkham in quest of the\\ndreaded volume kept under lock and key at the college libraryâ\\x80\\x94the\\nhideous Necronomicon of the mad Arab Alhazred in Olaus Wormius\\' Latin\\nversion, as printed in Spain in the Seventeenth Century. He had never\\nseen a city before, but had no thought save to find his way to the\\nuniversity grounds; where, indeed, he passed heedlessly by the great\\nwhite-fanged watchdog that barked with unnatural fury and enmity, and\\ntugged frantically at its stout chain.\\n\\nWilbur had with him the priceless but imperfect copy of Dr. Dee\\'s\\nEnglish version which his grandfather had bequeathed him, and upon\\nreceiving access to the Latin copy he at once began to collate the two\\ntexts with the aim of discovering a certain passage which would have\\ncome on the 751st page of his own defective volume. This much he could\\nnot civilly refrain from telling the librarianâ\\x80\\x94the same erudite Henry\\nArmitage (A. M. Miskatonic, Ph. D. Princeton, Litt. D. Johns Hopkins)\\nwho had once called at the farm, and who now politely plied him with\\nquestions. He was looking, he had to admit, for a kind of formula or\\nincantation containing the frightful name Yog-Sothoth , and it puzzled\\nhim to find discrepancies, duplications, and ambiguities which made\\nthe matter of determination far from easy. As he copied the formula\\nhe finally chose, Dr. Armitage looked involuntarily over his shoulder\\nat the open pages; the left-hand one of which, in the Latin version,\\ncontained such monstrous threats to the peace and sanity of the world.\\n\\nNor is it to be thought [ran the text as Armitage mentally translated\\nit] that man is either the oldest or the last of earth\\'s masters,\\nor that the common bulk of life and substance walks alone. The Old\\nOnes were, the Old Ones are, and the Old Ones shall be. Not in the\\nspaces we know, but between them. They walk serene and primal,\\nundimensioned and to us unseen. Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and guardian of\\nthe gate. Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth . He\\nknows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall\\nbreak through again. He knows where They have trod earth\\'s fields,\\nand where They still tread them, and why no one can behold Them as\\nThey tread. By Their smell can men sometimes know Them near, but of\\nTheir semblance can no man know, saving only in the features of those\\nThey have begotten on mankind ; and of those are there many sorts,\\ndiffering in likeness from man\\'s truest eidolon to that shape without\\nsight or substance which is They . They walk unseen and foul in\\nlonely places where the Words have been spoken and the Rites howled\\nthrough at their Seasons.

The bent, goatish giant before him seemed like\\nthe spawn of another planet or dimension; like something only partly of\\nmankind, and linked to black gulfs of essence and entity that stretch\\nlike titan fantasms beyond all spheres of force and matter, space and\\ntime.\\n\\nPresently Wilbur raised his head and began speaking in that strange,\\nresonant fashion which hinted at sound-producing organs unlike the run\\nof mankind\\'s.\\n\\n\"Mr. Armitage,\" he said, \"I calc\\'late I\\'ve got to take that book home.\\nThey\\'s things in it I\\'ve got to try under sarten conditions that I\\ncan\\'t git here, an\\' it \\'ud be a mortal sin to let a red-tape rule hold\\nme up. Let me take it along, sir, an\\' I\\'ll swar they wun\\'t nobody know\\nthe difference. I dun\\'t need to tell ye I\\'ll take good keer of it. It\\nwa\\'n\\'t me that put this Dee copy in the shape it is....\"\\n\\nHe stopped as he saw firm denial on the librarian\\'s face, and his own\\ngoatish features grew crafty. Armitage, half ready to tell him he might\\nmake a copy of what parts he needed, thought suddenly of the possible\\nconsequences and checked himself. There was too much responsibility\\nin giving such a being the key to such blasphemous outer spheres.\\nWhateley saw how things stood, and tried to answer lightly.\\n\\n\"Wal, all right, ef ye feel that way abaout it. Maybe Harvard wun\\'t be\\nso fussy as yew be.\" And without saying more he rose and strode out of\\nthe building, stooping at each doorway.\\n\\nArmitage heard the savage yelping of the great watchdog, and studied\\nWhateley\\'s gorilla-like lope as he crossed the bit of campus visible\\nfrom the window. He thought of the wild tales he had heard, and\\nrecalled the old Sunday stories in the Advertiser ; these things, and\\nthe lore he had picked up from Dunwich rustics and villagers during\\nhis one visit there. Unseen things not of earthâ\\x80\\x94or at least not of\\ntri-dimensional earthâ\\x80\\x94rushed fetid and horrible through New England\\'s\\nglens, and brooded obscenely on the mountain tops. Of this he had\\nlong felt certain. Now he seemed to sense the close presence of some\\nterrible part of the intruding horror, and to glimpse a hellish advance\\nin the black dominion of the ancient and once passive nightmare. He\\nlocked away the Necronomicon with a shudder of disgust, but the room\\nstill reeked with an unholy and unidentifiable stench. \"As a foulness\\nshall ye know them,\" he quoted. Yesâ\\x80\\x94the odor was the same as that\\nwhich had sickened him at the Whateley farmhouse less than three years\\nbefore. He thought of Wilbur, goatish and ominous, once again, and\\nlaughed mockingly at the village rumors of his parentage.\\n\\n\"Inbreeding?\" Armitage muttered half aloud to himself. \"Great God, what\\nsimpletons! Show them Arthur Machen\\'s Great God Pan and they\\'ll think\\nit a common Dunwich scandal! But what thingâ\\x80\\x94what cursed shapeless\\ninfluence on or off this three-dimensioned earthâ\\x80\\x94was Wilbur Whateley\\'s\\nfather? Born on Candlemasâ\\x80\\x94nine months after May Eve of 1912, when the\\ntalk about the queer earth noises reached clear to Arkhamâ\\x80\\x94what walked\\non the mountains that May Night? What Roodmas horror fastened itself on\\nthe world in half-human flesh and blood?\"\\n\\nDuring the ensuing weeks Dr. Armitage set about to collect all possible\\ndata on Wilbur Whateley and the formless presences around Dunwich. He\\ngot in communication with Dr. Houghton of Aylesbury, who had attended\\nOld Whateley in his last illness, and found much to ponder over in the\\ngrandfather\\'s last words as quoted by the physician. A visit to Dunwich\\nVillage failed to bring out much that was new; but a close survey of\\nthe Necronomicon , in those parts which Wilbur had sought so avidly,\\nseemed to supply new and terrible clues to the nature, methods, and\\ndesires of the strange evil so vaguely threatening this planet. Talks\\nwith several students of archaic lore in Boston, and letters to many\\nothers elsewhere, gave him a growing amazement which passed slowly\\nthrough varied degrees of alarm to a state of really acute spiritual\\nfear. As the summer drew on he felt dimly that something ought to be\\ndone about the lurking terrors of the upper Miskatonic valley, and\\nabout the monstrous being known to the human world as Wilbur Whateley.\\n\\n6\\n\\nThe Dunwich horror itself came between Lammas and the equinox in 1928,\\nand Dr. Armitage was among those who witnessed its monstrous prologue.\\nHe had heard, meanwhile, of Whateley\\'s grotesque trip to Cambridge,\\nand of his frantic efforts to borrow or copy from the Necronomicon at the Widener Library. Those efforts had been in vain, since Armitage\\nhad issued warnings of the keenest intensity to all librarians having\\ncharge of the dreaded volume. Wilbur had been shockingly nervous at\\nCambridge; anxious for the book, yet almost equally anxious to get\\nhome again, as if he feared the results of being away long.\\n\\nEarly in August the half-expected outcome developed, and in the small\\nhours of the third Dr. Armitage was awakened suddenly by the wild,\\nfierce cries of the savage watchdog on the college campus. Deep and\\nterrible, the snarling, half-mad growls and barks continued; always\\nin mounting volume, but with hideously significant pauses. Then there\\nrang out a scream from a wholly different throatâ\\x80\\x94such a scream as\\nroused half the sleepers of Arkham and haunted their dreams ever\\nafterwardâ\\x80\\x94such a scream as could come from no being born of earth, or\\nwholly of earth.\\n\\nArmitage hastened into some clothing and rushed across the street and\\nlawn to the college buildings, saw that others were ahead of him; and\\nheard the echoes of a burglar-alarm still shrilling from the library.\\nAn open window showed black and gaping in the moonlight. What had come\\nhad indeed completed its entrance; for the barking and the screaming,\\nnow fast fading into a mixed low growling and moaning, proceeded\\nunmistakably from within. Some instinct warned Armitage that what was\\ntaking place was not a thing for unfortified eyes to see, so he brushed\\nback the crowd with authority as he unlocked the vestibule door. Among\\nthe others he saw Professor Warren Rice and Dr. Francis Morgan, men to\\nwhom he had told some of his conjectures and misgivings; and these two\\nhe motioned to accompany him inside. The inward sounds, except for a\\nwatchful, droning whine from the dog, had by this time quite subsided;\\nbut Armitage now perceived with a sudden start that a loud chorus of\\nwhippoorwills among the shrubbery had commenced a damnably rhythmical\\npiping, as if in unison with the last breath of a dying man.\\n\\nThe building was full of a frightful stench which Dr. Armitage knew\\ntoo well, and the three men rushed across the hall to the small\\ngenealogical reading-room whence the low whining came. For a second\\nnobody dared to turn on the light; then Armitage summoned up his\\ncourage and snapped the switch. One of the threeâ\\x80\\x94it is not certain\\nwhichâ\\x80\\x94shrieked aloud at what sprawled before them among disordered\\ntables and overturned chairs. Professor Rice declares that he wholly\\nlost consciousness for an instant, though he did not stumble or fall.\\n\\nThe thing that lay half-bent on its side in a fetid pool of\\ngreenish-yellow ichor and tarry stickiness was almost nine feet tall,\\nand the dog had torn off all the clothing and some of the skin. It\\nwas not quite dead, but twitched silently and spasmodically while its\\nchest heaved in monstrous unison with the mad piping of the expectant\\nwhippoorwills outside. Bits of shoe-leather and fragments of apparel\\nwere scattered about the room, and just inside the window an empty\\ncanvas sack lay where it had evidently been thrown. Near the central\\ndesk a revolver had fallen, a dented but undischarged cartridge later\\nexplaining why it had not been fired. The thing itself, however,\\ncrowded out all other images at the time. It would be trite and not\\nwholly accurate to say that no human pen could describe it, but one may\\nproperly say that it could not be vividly visualized by anyone whose\\nideas of aspect and contour are too closely bound up with the common\\nlife-forms of this planet and of the three known dimensions. It was\\npartly human, beyond a doubt, with very manlike hands and head, and the\\ngoatish, chinless face had the stamp of the Whateleys upon it. But the\\ntorso and lower parts of the body were teratologically fabulous, so\\nthat only generous clothing could ever have enabled it to walk on earth\\nunchallenged or uneradicated.\\n\\nAbove the waist it was semi-anthropomorphic; though its chest, where\\nthe dog\\'s rending paws still rested watchfully, had the leathery,\\nreticulated hide of a crocodile or alligator. The back was piebald\\nwith yellow and black, and dimly suggested the squamous covering of\\ncertain snakes. Below the waist, though, it was the worst; for here\\nall human resemblance left off and sheer fantasy began. The skin was\\nthickly covered with coarse black fur, and from the abdomen a score of\\nlong greenish-gray tentacles with red sucking mouths protruded limply.\\nTheir arrangement was odd, and seemed to follow the symmetries of some\\ncosmic geometry unknown to earth or the solar system. On each of the\\nhips, deep set in a kind of pinkish, ciliated orbit, was what seemed to\\nbe a rudimentary eye; whilst in lieu of a tail there depended a kind of\\ntrunk or feeler with purple annular markings, and with many evidences\\nof being an undeveloped mouth or throat. The limbs, save for their\\nblack fur, roughly resembled the hind legs of prehistoric earth\\'s giant\\nsaurians; and terminated in ridgy-veined pads that were neither hooves\\nnor claws. When the thing breathed, its tail and tentacles rhythmically\\nchanged color, as if from some circulatory cause normal to the\\nnon-human side of its ancestry. In the tentacles this was observable as\\na deepening of the greenish tinge, whilst in the tail it was manifest\\nas a yellowish appearance which alternated with a sickly grayish-white\\nin the spaces between the purple rings. Of genuine blood there was\\nnone; only the fetid greenish-yellow ichor which trickled along the\\npainted floor beyond the radius of the stickiness, and left a curious\\ndiscoloration behind it.\\n\\nAs the presence of the three men seemed to rouse the dying thing, it\\nbegan to mumble without turning or raising its head. Dr. Armitage\\nmade no written record of its mouthings, but asserts confidently that\\nnothing in English was uttered. At first the syllables defied all\\ncorrelation with any speech of earth, but toward the last there came\\nsome disjointed fragments evidently taken from the Necronomicon ,\\nthat monstrous blasphemy in quest of which the thing had perished.\\nThose fragments, as Armitage recalls them, ran something like \" N\\'gai,\\nn\\'gha\\'ghaa, bugg-shoggog, y\\'hah; Yog-Sothoth, Yog-Sothoth.... \"\\nThey trailed off into nothingness as the whippoorwills shrieked in\\nrhythmical crescendoes of unholy anticipation.\\n\\nThen came a halt in the gasping, and the dog raised his head in a long,\\nlugubrious howl. A change came over the yellow, goatish face of the\\nprostrate thing, and the great black eyes fell in appallingly. Outside\\nthe window the shrilling of the whippoorwills had suddenly ceased, and\\nabove the murmurs of the gathering crowd there came the sound of a\\npanic-struck whirring and fluttering. Against the moon vast clouds of\\nfeathery watchers rose and raced from sight, frantic at that which they\\nhad sought for prey.\\n\\nAll at once the dog started up abruptly, gave a frightened bark, and\\nleaped nervously out the window by which it had entered. A cry rose\\nfrom the crowd, and Dr. Armitage shouted to the men outside that no\\none must be admitted till the police or medical examiner came. He was\\nthankful that the windows were just too high to permit of peering\\nin, and drew the dark curtains carefully down over each one. By this\\ntime two policemen had arrived; and Dr. Morgan, meeting them in the\\nvestibule, was urging them for their own sakes to postpone entrance to\\nthe stench-filled reading-room till the examiner came and the prostrate\\nthing could be covered up.\\n\\nMeanwhile frightful changes were taking place on the floor. One need\\nnot describe the kind and rate of shrinkage and disintegration that\\noccurred before the eyes of Dr. Armitage and Professor Rice; but it is\\npermissible to say that, aside from the external appearance of face\\nand hands, the really human elements in Wilbur Whateley must have been\\nvery small. When the medical examiner came, there was only a sticky\\nwhitish mass on the painted boards, and the monstrous odor had nearly\\ndisappeared. Apparently Whateley had had no skull or bony skeleton; at\\nleast, in any true or stable sense. He had taken somewhat after his\\nunknown father.\\n\\n7\\n\\nYet all this was only the prologue of the actual Dunwich horror.\\nFormalities were gone through by bewildered officials, abnormal details\\nwere duly kept from press and public, and men were sent to Dunwich\\nand Aylesbury to look up property and notify any who might be heirs\\nof the late Wilbur Whateley. They found the countryside in great\\nagitation, both because of the growing rumblings beneath the domed\\nhills, and because of the unwonted stench and the surging, lapping\\nsounds which came increasingly from the great empty shell formed by\\nWhateley\\'s boarded-up farmhouse. Earl Sawyer, who tended the horse and\\ncattle during Wilbur\\'s absence, had developed a wofully acute case\\nof nerves. The officials devised excuses not to enter the noisome\\nboarded place; and were glad to confine their survey of the deceased\\'s\\nliving quarters, the newly mended sheds, to a single visit. They filed\\na ponderous report at the court-house in Aylesbury, and litigations\\nconcerning heirship are said to be still in progress amongst the\\ninnumerable Whateleys, decayed and undecayed, of the upper Miskatonic\\nvalley.\\n\\nAn almost interminable manuscript in strange characters, written in a\\nhuge ledger and adjudged a sort of diary because of the spacing and\\nthe variations in ink and penmanship, presented a baffling puzzle to\\nthose who found it on the old bureau which served as its owner\\'s\\ndesk. After a week of debate it was sent to Miskatonic University,\\ntogether with the deceased\\'s collection of strange books, for study\\nand possible translation; but even the best linguists soon saw that it\\nwas not likely to be unriddled with ease. No trace of the ancient gold\\nwith which Wilbur and Old Whateley always paid their debts has yet been\\ndiscovered.\\n\\nIt was in the dark of September ninth that the horror broke loose.\\nThe hill noises had been very pronounced during the evening, and dogs\\nbarked frantically all night. Early risers on the tenth noticed a\\npeculiar stench in the air. About 7 o\\'clock Luther Brown, the hired boy\\nat George Corey\\'s, between Cold Spring Glen and the village, rushed\\nfrenziedly back from his morning trip to Ten-Acre Meadow with the cows.\\nHe was almost convulsed with fright as he stumbled into the kitchen;\\nand in the yard outside the no less frightened herd were pawing and\\nlowing pitifully, having followed the boy back in the panic they shared\\nwith him. Between gasps Luther tried to stammer out his tale to Mrs.\\nCorey.\\n\\n\"Up thar in the rud beyont the glen, Mis\\' Coreyâ\\x80\\x94they\\'s suthin\\' ben\\nthar! It smells like thunder, an\\' all the bushes an\\' little trees is\\npushed back from the rud like they\\'d a haouse ben moved along of it.\\nAn\\' that ain\\'t the wust, nuther. They\\'s prints in the rud, Mis\\'\\nCoreyâ\\x80\\x94great raound prints as big as barrel-heads, all sunk daown deep\\nlike a elephant had ben along, only they\\'s a sight more nor four feet\\ncould make . I looked at one or two afore I run, an\\' I see every one\\nwas covered with lines spreadin\\' aout from one place, like as if big\\npalm-leaf fansâ\\x80\\x94twict or three times as big as any they isâ\\x80\\x94hed of ben\\npaounded daown into the rud. An\\' the smell was awful, like what it is\\naraound Wizard Whateley\\'s ol\\' haouse....\"\\n\\nHere he faltered, and seemed to shiver afresh with the fright that had\\nsent him flying home. Mrs. Corey, unable to extract more information,\\nbegan telephoning the neighbors; thus starting on its rounds the\\noverture of panic that heralded the major terrors. When she got Sally\\nSawyer, housekeeper at Seth Bishop\\'s, the nearest place to Whateley\\'s,\\nit became her turn to listen instead of transmit; for Sally\\'s boy\\nChauncey, who slept poorly, had been up on the hill toward Whateley\\'s,\\nand had dashed back in terror after one look at the place, and at the\\npasturage where Mr. Bishop\\'s cows had been left out all night.\\n\\n\"Yes, Mis\\' Corey,\" came Sally\\'s tremulous voice over the party wire,\\n\"Cha\\'ncey he just come back a-post-in\\', and couldn\\'t haff talk fer\\nbein\\' scairt! He says Ol\\' Whateley\\'s haouse is all blowed up, with\\nthe timbers scattered raound like they\\'d ben dynamite inside; only\\nthe bottom floor ain\\'t through, but is all covered with a kind o\\'\\ntarlike stuff that smells awful an\\' drips daown offen the aidges onto\\nthe graoun\\' whar the side timbers is blowed away. An\\' they\\'s awful\\nkinder marks in the yard, tewâ\\x80\\x94great raound marks bigger raound than a\\nhogshead, an\\' all sticky with stuff like is on the blowed-up haouse.\\nCha\\'ncey he says they leads off into the medders, whar a great swath\\nwider\\'n a barn is matted daown, an\\' all the stun walls tumbled every\\nwhich way wherever it goes.\\n\\n\"An\\' he says, says he, Mis\\' Corey, as haow he sot to look fer Seth\\'s\\ncaows, frighted ez he was; an\\' faound \\'em in the upper pasture nigh the\\nDevil\\'s Hop Yard in an awful shape. Haff on \\'em\\'s clean gone, an\\' nigh\\nhaff o\\' them that\\'s left is sucked most dry o\\' blood, with sores on \\'em\\nlike they\\'s ben on Whateley\\'s cattle ever senct Lavinny\\'s black brat\\nwas born. Seth he\\'s gone aout naow to look at \\'em, though I\\'ll vaow he\\nwun\\'t keer ter git very nigh Wizard Whateley\\'s! Cha\\'ncey didn\\'t look\\nkeerful ter see whar the big matted-daown swath led arter it leff the\\npasturage, but he says he thinks it p\\'inted towards the glen rud to the\\nvillage.\\n\\n\"I tell ye, Mis\\' Corey, they\\'s suthin\\' abroad as hadn\\'t orter be\\nabroad, an\\' I fer one think that black Wilbur Whateley, as come to\\nthe bad eend he desarved, is at the bottom of the breedin\\' of it. He\\nwa\\'n\\'t all human hisself, I allus says to everybody; an\\' I think he an\\'\\nOl\\' Whateley must a raised suthin\\' in that there nailed-up haouse as\\nain\\'t even so human as he was. They\\'s allus ben unseen things araound\\nDunwichâ\\x80\\x94livin\\' thingsâ\\x80\\x94as ain\\'t human an\\' ain\\'t good fer human folks.\\n\\n\"The graoun\\' was a\\'talkin\\' lass night, an\\' towards mornin\\' Cha\\'ncey\\nhe heerd the whippoorwills so laoud in Col\\' Spring Glen he couldn\\'t\\nsleep none. Then he thought he heerd another faintlike saound over\\ntowards Wizard Whateley\\'sâ\\x80\\x94a kinder rippin\\' or tearin\\' o\\' wood, like\\nsome big box or crate was bein\\' opened fur off. What with this an\\'\\nthat, he didn\\'t git to sleep at all till sunup, an\\' no sooner was he\\nup this mornin\\', but he\\'s got to go over to Whateley\\'s an\\' see what\\'s\\nthe matter. He see enough, I tell ye, Mis\\' Corey! This dun\\'t mean no\\ngood, an\\' I think as all the men-folks ought to git up a party an\\'\\ndo suthin\\'.

No?\\nWal, Mis\\' Corey, ef they was on the glen rud this side o\\' the glen,\\nan\\' ain\\'t got to your haouse yet, I calc\\'late they must go into the\\nglen itself. They would do that. I allus says Col\\' Spring Glen ain\\'t no\\nhealthy nor decent place. The whippoorwills an\\' fireflies there never\\ndid act like they was creaters o\\' Gawd, an\\' they\\'s them as says ye kin\\nhear strange things a-rushin\\' an\\' a-talkin\\' in the air daown thar ef ye\\nstand in the right place, atween the rock falls an\\' Bear\\'s Den.\"\\n\\nBy that noon fully three-quarters of the men and boys of Dunwich were\\ntrooping over the roads and meadows between the new-made Whateley ruins\\nand Cold Spring Glen; examining in horror the vast, monstrous prints,\\nthe maimed Bishop cattle, the strange, noisome wreck of the farmhouse,\\nand the bruised, matted vegetation of the fields and road-sides.\\nWhatever had burst loose upon the world had assuredly gone down into\\nthe great sinister ravine; for all the trees on the banks were bent and\\nbroken, and a great avenue had been gouged in the precipice-hanging\\nunderbrush. It was as though a house, launched by an avalanche, had\\nslid down through the tangled growths of the almost vertical slope.\\nFrom below no sound came, but only a distant, undefinable fetor; and\\nit is not to be wondered at that the men preferred to stay on the edge\\nand argue, rather than descend and beard the unknown Cyclopean horror\\nin its lair. Three dogs that were with the party had barked furiously\\nat first, but seemed cowed and reluctant when near the glen. Someone\\ntelephoned the news to the Aylesbury Transcript ; but the editor,\\naccustomed to wild tales from Dunwich, did no more than concoct a\\nhumorous paragraph about it; an item soon afterward reproduced by the\\nAssociated Press.\\n\\nThat night everyone went home, and every house and barn was barricaded\\nas stoutly as possible. Needless to say, no cattle were allowed to\\nremain in open pasturage. About 2 in the morning a frightful stench and\\nthe savage barking of the dogs awakened the household at Elmer Frye\\'s,\\non the eastern edge of Cold Spring Glen, and all agreed that they\\ncould hear a sort of muffled swishing or lapping sound from somewhere\\noutside. Mrs. Frye proposed telephoning the neighbors, and Elmer was\\nabout to agree when the noise of splintering wood burst in upon their\\ndeliberations. It came, apparently, from the barn; and was quickly\\nfollowed by a hideous screaming and stamping amongst the cattle. The\\ndogs slavered and crouched close to the feet of the fear-numbed family.\\nFrye lit a lantern through force of habit, but knew it would be death\\nto go out into that black farmyard. The children and the women-folk\\nwhimpered, kept from screaming by some obscure, vestigial instinct\\nof defense which told them their lives depended on silence. At last\\nthe noise of the cattle subsided to a pitiful moaning, and a great\\nsnapping, crashing, and crackling ensued. The Fryes, huddled together\\nin the sitting-room, did not dare to move until the last echoes died\\naway far down in Cold Spring Glen. Then, amidst the dismal moans from\\nthe stable and the demoniac piping of late whippoorwills in the glen,\\nSelina Frye tottered to the telephone and spread what news she could of\\nthe second phase of the horror.\\n\\nThe next day all the countryside was in a panic; and cowed,\\nuncommunicative groups came and went where the fiendish thing had\\noccurred. Two titan swaths of destruction stretched from the glen\\nto the Frye farmyard, monstrous prints covered the bare patches of\\nground, and one side of the old red barn had completely caved in. Of\\nthe cattle, only about a quarter could be found and identified. Some of\\nthese were in curious fragments, and all that survived had to be shot.\\nEarl Sawyer suggested that help be asked from Aylesbury or Arkham, but\\nothers maintained it would be of no use. Old Zebulon Whateley, of a\\nbranch that hovered about half-way between soundness and decadence,\\nmade darkly wild suggestions about rites that ought to be practised on\\nthe hilltops. He came of a line where tradition ran strong, and his\\nmemories of chantings in the great stone circles were not altogether\\nconnected with Wilbur and his grandfather.\\n\\nDarkness fell upon a stricken countryside too passive to organize\\nfor real defense. In a few cases closely related families would band\\ntogether and watch in the gloom under one roof; but, in general there\\nwas only a repetition of the barricading of the night before, and a\\nfutile, ineffective gesture of loading muskets and setting pitchforks\\nhandily about. Nothing, however, occurred except some hill noises; and\\nwhen the day came there were many who hoped that the new horror had\\ngone as swiftly as it had come. There were even bold souls who proposed\\nan offensive expedition down in the glen, though they did not venture\\nto set an actual example to the still reluctant majority.\\n\\nWhen night came again the barricading was repeated, though there was\\nless huddling together of families. In the morning both the Frye and\\nthe Seth Bishop households reported excitement among the dogs and vague\\nsounds and stenches from afar, while early explorers noted with horror\\na fresh set of the monstrous tracks in the road skirting Sentinel Hill.\\nAs before, the sides of the road showed a bruising indicative of the\\nblasphemously stupendous bulk of the horror; whilst the conformation\\nof the tracks seemed to argue a passage in two directions, as if the\\nmoving mountain had come from Cold Spring Glen and returned to it along\\nthe same path. At the base of the hill a thirty-foot swath of crushed\\nshrubbery and saplings led steeply upward, and the seekers gasped when\\nthey saw that even the most perpendicular places did not deflect the\\ninexorable trail. Whatever the horror was, it could scale a sheer stony\\ncliff of almost complete verticality; and as the investigators climbed\\naround to the hill\\'s summit by safer routes they saw that the trail\\nendedâ\\x80\\x94or rather, reversedâ\\x80\\x94there.\\n\\nIt was here that the Whateleys used to build their hellish fires and\\nchant their hellish rituals by the table-like stone on May Eve and\\nHallowmass. Now that very stone formed the center of a vast space\\nthrashed around by the mountainous horror, whilst upon its slightly\\nconcave surface was a thick fetid deposit of the same tarry stickiness\\nobserved on the floor of the ruined Whateley farmhouse when the horror\\nescaped. Men looked at one another and muttered. Then they looked down\\nthe hill. Apparently the horror had descended by a route much the same\\nas that of its ascent. To speculate was futile. Reason, logic, and\\nnormal ideas of motivation stood confounded. Only old Zebulon, who\\nwas not with the group, could have done justice to the situation or\\nsuggested a plausible explanation.\\n\\nThursday night began much like the others, but it ended less happily.\\nThe whippoorwills in the glen had screamed with such unusual\\npersistence that many could not sleep, and about 3 a. m. all the party\\ntelephones rang tremulously. Those who took down their receivers\\nheard a fright-mad voice shriek out, \"Help, oh, my Gawd!...\" and some\\nthought a crashing sound followed the breaking off of the exclamation.\\nThere was nothing more. No one dared do anything, and no one knew\\ntill morning whence the call came. Then those who had heard it called\\neveryone on the line, and found that only the Fryes did not reply. The\\ntruth appeared an hour later, when a hastily assembled group of armed\\nmen trudged out to the Frye place at the head of the glen. It was\\nhorrible, yet hardly a surprize. There were more swaths and monstrous\\nprints, but there was no longer any house. It had caved in like an\\negg-shell, and amongst the ruins nothing living or dead could be\\ndiscoveredâ\\x80\\x94only a stench and a tarry stickiness. The Elmer Fryes had\\nbeen erased from Dunwich.\\n\\n8\\n\\nIn the meantime a quieter yet even more spiritually poignant phase of\\nthe horror had been blackly unwinding itself behind the closed door of\\na shelf-lined room in Arkham. The curious manuscript record or diary of\\nWilbur Whateley, delivered to Miskatonic University for translation,\\nhad caused much worry and bafflement among the experts in languages\\nboth ancient and modern; its very alphabet, notwithstanding a general\\nresemblance to the heavily shaded Arabic used in Mesopotamia, being\\nabsolutely unknown to any available authority. The final conclusion of\\nthe linguists was that the text represented an artificial alphabet,\\ngiving the effect of a cipher; though none of the usual methods of\\ncryptographic solution seemed to furnish any clue, even when applied\\non the basis of every tongue the writer might conceivably have used.\\nThe ancient books taken from Whateley\\'s quarters, while absorbingly\\ninteresting and in several cases promising to open up new and terrible\\nlines of research among philosophers and men of science, were of no\\nassistance whatever in this matter. One of them, a heavy tome with\\nan iron clasp, was in another unknown alphabetâ\\x80\\x94this one of a very\\ndifferent cast, and resembling Sanskrit more than anything else. The\\nold ledger was at length given wholly into the charge of Dr. Armitage,\\nboth because of his peculiar interest in the Whateley matter, and\\nbecause of his wide linguistic learning and skill in the mystical\\nformulÃ¦ of antiquity and the Middle Ages.\\n\\nArmitage had an idea that the alphabet might be something esoterically\\nused by certain forbidden cults which have come down from old times,\\nand which have inherited many forms and traditions from the wizards of\\nthe Saracenic world. That question, however, he did not deem vital;\\nsince it would be unnecessary to know the origin of the symbols if,\\nas he suspected, they were used as a cipher in a modern language. It\\nwas his belief that, considering the great amount of text involved, the\\nwriter would scarcely have wished the trouble of using another speech\\nthan his own, save perhaps in certain special formulÃ¦ and incantations.\\nAccordingly he attacked the manuscript with the preliminary assumption\\nthat the bulk of it was in English.\\n\\nDr. Armitage knew, from the repeated failures of his colleagues, that\\nthe riddle was a deep and complex one, and that no simple mode of\\nsolution could merit even a trial. All through late August he fortified\\nhimself with the massed lore of cryptography, drawing upon the fullest\\nresources of his own library, and wading night after night amidst the\\narcana of Trithemius\\' Poligraphia , Giambattista Porta\\'s De Furtivis\\nLiterarum Notis , De Vigenere\\'s TraitÃ© des Chiffres , Falconer\\'s Cryptomenysis Patefacta , Davys\\' and Thicknesse\\'s Eighteenth Century\\ntreatises, and such fairly modern authorities as Blair, von Marten,\\nand KlÃ¼ber\\'s Kryptographik . He interspersed his study of the books\\nwith attacks on the manuscript itself, and in time became convinced\\nthat he had to deal with one of those subtlest and most ingenious of\\ncryptograms, in which many separate lists of corresponding letters are\\narranged like the multiplication table, and the message built up with\\narbitrary key-words known only to the initiated. The older authorities\\nseemed rather more helpful than the newer ones, and Armitage concluded\\nthat the code of the manuscript was one of great antiquity, no doubt\\nhanded down through a long line of mystical experimenters. Several\\ntimes he seemed near daylight, only to be set back by some unforeseen\\nobstacle. Then, as September approached, the clouds began to clear.\\nCertain letters, as used in certain parts of the manuscript, emerged\\ndefinitely and unmistakably; and it became obvious that the text was\\nindeed in English.\\n\\nOn the evening of September second the last major barrier gave way, and\\nDr. Armitage read for the first time a continuous passage of Wilbur\\nWhateley\\'s annals. It was in truth a diary, as all had thought; and\\nit was couched in a style clearly showing the mixed occult erudition\\nand general illiteracy of the strange being who wrote it. Almost the\\nfirst long passage that Armitage deciphered, an entry dated November\\n26, 1916, proved highly startling and disquieting. It was written, he\\nremembered, by a child of three and a half who looked like a lad of\\ntwelve or thirteen.\\n\\nToday learned the Aklo for the Sabaoth, [it ran] which did not like,\\nit being answerable from the hill and not from the air. That upstairs\\nmore ahead of me than I had thought it would be, and is not like to\\nhave much earth brain. Shot Elam Hutchins\\'s collie Jack when he went\\nto bite me, and Elam says he would kill me if he dast. I guess he\\nwon\\'t. Grandfather kept me saying the Dho formula last night, and I\\nthink I saw the inner city at the 2 magnetic poles. I shall go to\\nthose poles when the earth is cleared off, if I can\\'t break through\\nwith the Dho-Hna formula when I commit it. They from the air told me\\nat Sabbat that it will be years before I can clear off the earth,\\nand I guess Grandfather will be dead then, so I shall have to learn\\nall the angles of the planes and all the formulas between the Yr and\\nthe Nhhngr. They from outside will help, but they can not take body\\nwithout human blood. That upstairs looks it will have the right cast.\\nI can see it a little when I make the Yoorish sign or blow the power\\nof Ibn Ghazi at it, and it is near like them at May Eve on the Hill.\\nThe other face may wear off some. I wonder how I shall look when the\\nearth is cleared and there are no earth beings on it. He that came\\nwith the Aklo Sabaoth said I may be transfigured, there being much of\\noutside to work on.\\n\\nMorning found Dr. Armitage in a cold sweat of terror and a frenzy of\\nwakeful concentration. He had not left the manuscript all night, but\\nsat at his table under the electric light turning page after page\\nwith shaking hands as fast as he could decipher the cryptic text. He\\nhad nervously telephoned his wife he would not be home, and when she\\nbrought him a breakfast from the house he could scarcely dispose of a\\nmouthful. All that day he read on, now and then halted maddeningly as\\na reapplication of the complex key became necessary. Lunch and dinner\\nwere brought him, but he ate only the smallest fraction of either.\\nToward the middle of the next night he drowsed off in his chair, but\\nsoon woke out of a tangle of nightmares almost as hideous as the truths\\nand menaces to man\\'s existence that he had uncovered.\\n\\nOn the morning of September fourth Professor Rice and Dr. Morgan\\ninsisted on seeing him for a while, and departed trembling and\\nashen-gray. That evening he went to bed, but slept only fitfully.\\nWednesdayâ\\x80\\x94the next dayâ\\x80\\x94he was back at the manuscript, and began to\\ntake copious notes both from the current sections and from those he had\\nalready deciphered. In the small hours of that night he slept a little\\nin an easy-chair in his office, but was at the manuscript again before\\ndawn. Some time before noon his physician, Dr. Hartwell, called to see\\nhim and insisted that he cease work. He refused, intimating that it was\\nof the most vital importance for him to complete the reading of the\\ndiary, and promising an explanation in due course of time.\\n\\nThat evening, just as twilight fell, he finished his terrible perusal\\nand sank back exhausted. His wife, bringing his dinner, found him in a\\nhalf-comatose state; but he was conscious enough to warn her off with\\na sharp cry when he saw her eyes wander toward the notes he had taken.\\nWeakly rising, he gathered up the scribbled papers and sealed them all\\nin a great envelope, which he immediately placed in his inside coat\\npocket. He had sufficient strength to get home, but was so clearly in\\nneed of medical aid that Dr. Hartwell was summoned at once. As the\\ndoctor put him to bed he could only mutter over and over again, \" But\\nwhat, in God\\'s name, can we do? \"\\n\\nDr. Armitage slept, but was partly delirious the next day. He made\\nno explanations to Hartwell, but in his calmer moments spoke of the\\nimperative need of a long conference with Rice and Morgan. His wilder\\nwanderings were very startling indeed, including frantic appeals\\nthat something in a boarded-up farmhouse be destroyed, and fantastic\\nreferences to some plan for the extirpation of the entire human race\\nand all animal and vegetable life from the earth by some terrible elder\\nrace of beings from another dimension. He would shout that the world\\nwas in danger, since the Elder Things wished to strip it and drag it\\naway from the solar system and cosmos of matter into some other plane\\nor phase of entity from which it had once fallen, vigintillions of eons\\nago. At other times he would call for the dreaded Necronomicon and\\nthe DÃ¦monolatreia of Remigius, in which he seemed hopeful of finding\\nsome formula to check the peril he conjured up.\\n\\n\"Stop them, stop them!\" he would shout. \"Those Whateleys meant to let\\nthem in, and the worst of all is left! Tell Rice and Morgan we must do\\nsomethingâ\\x80\\x94it\\'s a blind business, but I know how to make the powder....\\nIt hasn\\'t been fed since the second of August, when Wilbur came here to\\nhis death, and at that rate....\"\\n\\nBut Armitage had a sound physique despite his seventy-three years, and\\nslept off his disorder that night without developing any real fever. He\\nwoke late Friday, clear of head, though sober, with a gnawing fear and\\ntremendous sense of responsibility. Saturday afternoon he felt able to\\ngo over to the library and summon Rice and Morgan for a conference, and\\nthe rest of that day and evening the three men tortured their brains\\nin the wildest speculation and the most desperate debate. Strange and\\nterrible books were drawn voluminously from the stack shelves and from\\nsecure places of storage, and diagrams and formulÃ¦ were copied with\\nfeverish haste and in bewildering abundance. Of skepticism there was\\nnone. All three had seen the body of Wilbur Whateley as it lay on the\\nfloor in a room of that very building, and after that not one of them\\ncould feel even slightly inclined to treat the diary as a madman\\'s\\nraving.\\n\\nOpinions were divided as to notifying the Massachusetts State Police,\\nand the negative finally won. There were things involved which simply\\ncould not be believed by those who had not seen a sample, as indeed was\\nmade clear during certain subsequent investigations. Late at night the\\nconference disbanded without having developed a definite plan, but all\\nday Sunday Armitage was busy comparing formulÃ¦ and mixing chemicals\\nobtained from the college laboratory. The more he reflected on the\\nhellish diary, the more he was inclined to doubt the efficacy of any\\nmaterial agent in stamping out the entity which Wilbur Whateley had\\nleft behind himâ\\x80\\x94the earth-threatening entity which, unknown to him,\\nwas to burst forth in a few hours and become the memorable Dunwich\\nhorror.\\n\\nMonday was a repetition of Sunday with Dr. Armitage, for the task\\nin hand required an infinity of research and experiment. Further\\nconsultations of the monstrous diary brought about various changes of\\nplan, and he knew that even in the end a large amount of uncertainty\\nmust remain. By Tuesday he had a definite line of action mapped out,\\nand believed he would try a trip to Dunwich within a week. Then, on\\nWednesday, the great shock came. Tucked obscurely away in a corner of\\nthe Arkham Advertiser was a facetious little item from the Associated\\nPress, telling what a record-breaking monster the bootleg whisky of\\nDunwich had raised up. Armitage, half stunned, could only telephone\\nfor Rice and Morgan. Far into the night they discussed, and the next\\nday was a whirlwind of preparation on the part of them all. Armitage\\nknew he would be meddling with terrible powers, yet saw that there was\\nno other way to annul the deeper and more malign meddling which others\\nhad done before him.\\n\\n9\\n\\nFriday morning Armitage, Rice and Morgan set out by motor for Dunwich,\\narriving at the village about 1 in the afternoon. The day was pleasant,\\nbut even in the brightest sunlight a kind of quiet dread and portent\\nseemed to hover about the strangely domed hills and the deep, shadowy\\nravines of the stricken region. Now and then on some mountain top a\\ngaunt circle of stones could be glimpsed against the sky. From the\\nair of hushed fright at Osborn\\'s store they knew something hideous\\nhad happened, and soon learned of the annihilation of the Elmer Frye\\nhouse and family. Throughout that afternoon they rode around Dunwich,\\nquestioning the natives concerning all that had occurred, and seeing\\nfor themselves with rising pangs of horror the drear Frye ruins with\\ntheir lingering traces of the tarry stickiness, the blasphemous tracks\\nin the Frye yard, the wounded Seth Bishop cattle, and the enormous\\nswaths of disturbed vegetation in various places. The trail up and down\\nSentinel Hill seemed to Armitage of almost cataclysmic significance,\\nand he looked long at the sinister altarlike stone on the summit.\\n\\nAt length the visitors, apprised of a party of State Police which had\\ncome from Aylesbury that morning in response to the first telephone\\nreports of the Frye tragedy, decided to seek out the officers and\\ncompare notes as far as practicable. This, however, they found more\\neasily planned than performed; since no sign of the party could be\\nfound in any direction. There had been five of them in a car, but now\\nthe car stood empty near the ruins in the Frye yard. The natives, all\\nof whom had talked with the policemen, seemed at first as perplexed as\\nArmitage and his companions. Then old Sam Hutchins thought of something\\nand turned pale, nudging Fred Farr and pointing to the dank, deep\\nhollow that yawned close by.\\n\\n\"Gawd,\" he gasped, \"I telled \\'em not ter go daown into the glen, an\\' I\\nnever thought nobody\\'d dew it with them tracks an\\' that smell an\\' the\\nwhippoorwills a-screechin\\' daown thar in the dark o\\' noonday....\"\\n\\nA cold shudder ran through natives and visitors alike, and every ear\\nseemed strained in a kind of instinctive, unconscious listening.\\nArmitage, now that he had actually come upon the horror and its\\nmonstrous work, trembled with the responsibility he felt to be\\nhis. Night would soon fall, and it was then that the mountainous\\nblasphemy lumbered upon its eldritch course. Negotium perambulans in\\ntenebris.... The old librarian rehearsed the formulÃ¦ he had memorized,\\nand clutched the paper containing the alternative ones he had not\\nmemorized. He saw that his electric flashlight was in working order.\\nRice, beside him, took from a valise a metal sprayer of the sort used\\nin combating insects; whilst Morgan uncased the big-game rifle on which\\nhe relied despite his colleague\\'s warnings that no material weapon\\nwould be of help.\\n\\nArmitage, having read the hideous diary, knew painfully well what kind\\nof a manifestation to expect, but he did not add to the fright of the\\nDunwich people by giving any hints or clues. He hoped that it might\\nbe conquered without any revelation to the world of the monstrous\\nthing it had escaped. As the shadows gathered, the natives commenced\\nto disperse homeward, anxious to bar themselves indoors despite the\\npresent evidence that all human locks and bolts were useless before a\\nforce that could bend trees and crush houses when it chose. They shook\\ntheir heads at the visitors\\' plan to stand guard at the Frye ruins near\\nthe glen; and as they left, had little expectancy of ever seeing the\\nwatchers again.\\n\\nThere were rumblings under the hills that night, and the whippoorwills\\npiped threateningly. Once in a while a wind, sweeping up out of Cold\\nSpring Glen, would bring a touch of ineffable fetor to the heavy night\\nair; such a fetor as all three of the watchers had smelled once before,\\nwhen they stood above a dying thing that had passed for fifteen years\\nand a half as a human being. But the looked-for terror did not appear.\\nWhatever was down there in the glen was biding its time, and Armitage\\ntold his colleagues it would be suicidal to try to attack it in the\\ndark.\\n\\nMorning came wanly, and the night-sounds ceased. It was a gray, bleak\\nday, with now and then a drizzle of rain; and heavier and heavier\\nclouds seemed to be piling themselves up beyond the hills to the\\nnorthwest. The men from Arkham were undecided what to do. Seeking\\nshelter from the increasing rainfall beneath one of the few undestroyed\\nFrye outbuildings, they debated the wisdom of waiting, or of taking the\\naggressive and going down into the glen in quest of their nameless,\\nmonstrous quarry. The downpour waxed in heaviness, and distant peals of\\nthunder sounded from far horizons. Sheet lightning shimmered, and then\\na forky bolt flashed near at hand, as if descending into the accursed\\nglen itself. The sky grew very dark, and the watchers hoped that the\\nstorm would prove a short, sharp one followed by clear weather.\\n\\nIt was still gruesomely dark when, not much over an hour later, a\\nconfused babel of voices sounded down the road. Another moment brought\\nto view a frightened group of more than a dozen men, running, shouting,\\nand even whimpering hysterically. Someone in the lead began sobbing out\\nwords, and the Arkham men started violently when those words developed\\na coherent form.\\n\\n\"Oh, my Gawd, my Gawd!\" the voice choked out; \"it\\'s a-goin\\' agin, an\\'\\nthis time by day ! It\\'s aoutâ\\x80\\x94it\\'s aout an\\' a-movin\\' this very minute,\\nan\\' only the Lord knows when it\\'ll be on us all!\"\\n\\nThe speaker panted into silence, but another took up his message.\\n\\n\"Nigh on a haour ago Zeb Whateley here heerd the \\'phone a-ringin\\', an\\'\\nit was Mis\\' Corey, George\\'s wife that lives daown by the junction.\\nShe says the hired boy Luther was aout drivin\\' in the caows from the\\nstorm arter the big bolt, when he see all the trees a-bendin\\' at the\\nmaouth o\\' the glenâ\\x80\\x94opposite side ter thisâ\\x80\\x94an\\' smelt the same awful\\nsmell like he smelt when he faound the big tracks las\\' Monday mornin\\'.\\nAn\\' she says he says they was a swishin\\', lappin\\' saound, more nor\\nwhat the bendin\\' trees an\\' bushes could make, an\\' all on a suddent the\\ntrees along the rud begun ter git pushed one side, an\\' they was a awful\\nstompin\\' an\\' splashin\\' in the mud. But mind ye, Luther he didn\\'t see\\nnothin\\' at all, only jest the bendin\\' trees an\\' underbrush.\\n\\n\"Then fur ahead where Bishop\\'s Brook goes under the rud he heerd a\\nawful creakin\\' an\\' strainin\\' on the bridge, an\\' says he could tell the\\nsaound o\\' wood a-startin\\' to crack an\\' split. An\\' all the whiles he\\nnever see a thing, only them trees an\\' bushes a-bendin\\'. An\\' when the\\nswishin\\' saound got very fur offâ\\x80\\x94on the rud towards Wizard Whateley\\'s\\nan\\' Sentinel Hillâ\\x80\\x94Luther he had the guts ter step up whar he\\'d heerd\\nit fust an\\' look at the graound. It was all mud an\\' water, an\\' the sky\\nwas dark, an\\' the rain was wipin\\' aout all tracks abaout as fast as\\ncould be; but beginnin\\' at the glen maouth, whar the trees bed moved,\\nthey was still some o\\' them awful prints big as bar\\'ls like he seen\\nMonday.\"\\n\\nAt this point the first excited speaker interrupted.\\n\\n\"But that ain\\'t the trouble naowâ\\x80\\x94that was only the start. Zeb here\\nwas callin\\' folks up an\\' everybody was a-listenin\\' in when a call from\\nSeth Bishop\\'s cut in. His haousekeeper Sally was carryin\\' on fit ter\\nkillâ\\x80\\x94she\\'d jest seed the trees a-bendin\\' beside the rud, an\\' says\\nthey was a kind o\\' mushy saound, like a elephant puffin\\' an\\' treadin\\',\\na-headin\\' fer the haouse. Then she up an\\' spoke suddent of a fearful\\nsmell, an\\' says her boy Cha\\'ncey was a-screamin\\' as haow it was jest\\nlike what he smelt up to the Whateley rewins Monday mornin\\'. An\\' the\\ndogs was all barkin\\' an\\' whinin\\' awful.\\n\\n\"An\\' then she let aout a turrible yell, an\\' says the shed daown the\\nrud hed jest caved in like the storm hed blowed it over, only the wind\\nwa\\'n\\'t strong enough to dew that. Everybody was a-listenin\\', an\\' ye\\ncould hear lots o\\' folks on the wire a-gaspin\\'. All to onct Sally she\\nyelled agin, an\\' says the front yard picket fence bed jest crumpled up,\\nthough they wa\\'n\\'t no sign o\\' what done it. Then everybody on the line\\ncould hear Cha\\'ncey an\\' ol\\' Seth Bishop a-yellin\\', tew, an\\' Sally was\\nshriekin\\' aout that suthin\\' heavy hed struck the haouseâ\\x80\\x94not lightnin\\'\\nnor nothin\\', but suthin\\' heavy agin\\' the front, that kep\\' a-launchin\\'\\nitself agin an\\' agin, though ye couldn\\'t see nuthin\\' aout the front\\nwinders. An\\' then ... an\\' then....\"\\n\\nLines of fright deepened on every face; and Armitage, shaken as he was,\\nhad barely poise enough to prompt the speaker.\\n\\n\"An\\' then ... Sally she yelled aout, \\'O help, the haouse is a-cavin\\'\\nin\\' ... an\\' on the wire we could hoar a turrible crashin\\', an\\' a hull\\nflock o\\' screamin\\' ... jest like when Elmer Frye\\'s place was took, only\\nwuss....\"\\n\\nThe man paused, and another of the crowd spoke.\\n\\n\"That\\'s allâ\\x80\\x94not a saound nor squeak over the \\'phone arter that. Jest\\nstill-like. We that heerd it got aout Fords an\\' wagons an\\' raounded\\nup as many able-bodied men-folks as we could get, at Corey\\'s place,\\nan\\' come up here ter see what yew thought best ter dew. Not but what I\\nthink it\\'s the Lord\\'s judgment fer our iniquities, that no mortal kin\\never set aside.\"\\n\\nArmitage saw that the time for positive action had come, and spoke\\ndecisively to the faltering group of frightened rustics.\\n\\n\"We must follow it, boys.\" He made his voice as reassuring as possible.\\n\"I believe there\\'s a chance of putting it out of business. You men\\nknow that those Whateleys were wizardsâ\\x80\\x94well, this thing is a thing\\nof wizardry, and must be put down by the same means. I\\'ve seen Wilbur\\nWhateley\\'s diary and read some of the strange old books he used to\\nread, and I think I know the right kind of a spell to recite to make\\nthe thing fade away. Of course, one can\\'t be sure, but we can always\\ntake a chance. It\\'s invisibleâ\\x80\\x94I knew it would beâ\\x80\\x94but there\\'s a powder\\nin this long-distance sprayer that might make it show up for a second.\\nLater on we\\'ll try it. It\\'s a frightful thing to have alive, but it\\nisn\\'t as bad as what Wilbur would have let in if he\\'d lived longer.\\nYou\\'ll never know what the world has escaped. Now we\\'ve only this one\\nthing to fight, and it can\\'t multiply. It can, though, do a lot of\\nharm; so we mustn\\'t hesitate to rid the community of it.\\n\\n\"We must follow itâ\\x80\\x94and the way to begin is to go to the place that has\\njust been wrecked. Let somebody lead the wayâ\\x80\\x94I don\\'t know your roads\\nvery well, but I\\'ve an idea there might be a shorter cut across lots.\\nHow about it?\"\\n\\nThe men shuffled about a moment, and then Earl Sawyer spoke softly,\\npointing with a grimy finger through the steadily lessening rain.\\n\\n\"I guess ye kin git to Seth Bishop\\'s quickest by cuttin\\' acrost the\\nlower medder here, wadin\\' the brook at the low place, an\\' climbin\\'\\nthrough Carrier\\'s mowin\\' an\\' the timber-lot beyont. That comes aout on\\nthe upper rud mighty nigh Seth\\'sâ\\x80\\x94a leetle t\\'other side.\"\\n\\nArmitage, with Rice and Morgan, started to walk in the direction\\nindicated; and most of the natives followed slowly. The sky was growing\\nlighter, and there were signs that the storm had worn itself away. When\\nArmitage inadvertently took a wrong direction, Joe Osborn warned him\\nand walked ahead to show the right one. Courage and confidence were\\nmounting; though the twilight of the almost perpendicular wooded hill\\nwhich lay toward the end of their short cut, and among whose fantastic\\nancient trees they had to scramble as if up a ladder, put these\\nqualities to a severe test.\\n\\nAt length they emerged on a muddy road to find the sun coming out.\\nThey were a little beyond the Seth Bishop place, but bent trees and\\nhideously unmistakable tracks showed what had passed by. Only a few\\nmoments were consumed in surveying the ruins just around the bend. It\\nwas the Frye incident all over again, and nothing dead or living was\\nfound in either of the collapsed shells which had been the Bishop house\\nand barn. No one cared to remain there amidst the stench and the tarry\\nstickiness, but all turned instinctively to the line of horrible prints\\nleading on toward the wrecked Whateley farmhouse and the altar-crowned\\nslopes of Sentinel Hill.\\n\\nAs the men passed the site of Wilbur Whateley\\'s abode they shuddered\\nvisibly, and seemed again to mix hesitancy with their zeal. It was\\nno joke tracking down something as big as a house that one could not\\nsee, but that had all the vicious malevolence of a demon. Opposite the\\nbase of Sentinel Hill the tracks left the road, and there was a fresh\\nbending and matting visible along the broad swath marking the monster\\'s\\nformer route to and from the summit.\\n\\nArmitage produced a pocket telescope of considerable power and scanned\\nthe steep green side of the hill. Then he handed the instrument to\\nMorgan, whose sight was keener. After a moment of gazing Morgan cried\\nout sharply, passing the glass to Earl Sawyer and indicating a certain\\nspot on the slope with his finger. Sawyer, as clumsy as most non-users\\nof optical devices are, fumbled a while; but eventually focused the\\nlenses with Armitage\\'s aid. When he did so his cry was less restrained\\nthan Morgan\\'s had been.\\n\\n\"Gawd almighty, the grass an\\' bushes is a-movin\\'! It\\'s a-goin\\'\\nupâ\\x80\\x94slow-likeâ\\x80\\x94creepin\\' up ter the top this minute, heaven only knows\\nwhat fer!\"\\n\\nThen the germ of panic seemed to spread among the seekers. It was one\\nthing to chase the nameless entity, but quite another to find it.\\nSpells might be all rightâ\\x80\\x94but suppose they weren\\'t? Voices began\\nquestioning Armitage about what he knew of the thing, and no reply\\nseemed quite to satisfy. Everyone seemed to feel himself in close\\nproximity to phases of nature and of being utterly forbidden, and\\nwholly outside the sane experience of mankind.\\n\\n10\\n\\nIn the end the three men from Arkhamâ\\x80\\x94old, white-bearded Dr.\\nArmitage, stocky, iron-gray Professor Rice, and lean, youngish Dr.\\nMorganâ\\x80\\x94ascended the mountain alone. After much patient instruction\\nregarding its focusing and use, they left the telescope with the\\nfrightened group that remained in the road; and as they climbed they\\nwere watched closely by those among whom the glass was passed around.\\nIt was hard going, and Armitage had to be helped more than once. High\\nabove the toiling group the great swath trembled as its hellish maker\\nrepassed with snail-like deliberateness. Then it was obvious that the\\npursuers were gaining.\\n\\nCurtis Whateleyâ\\x80\\x94of the undecayed branchâ\\x80\\x94was holding the telescope\\nwhen the Arkham party detoured radically from the swath. He told the\\ncrowd that the men were evidently trying to get to a subordinate peak\\nwhich overlooked the swath at a point considerably ahead of where the\\nshrubbery was now bending. This, indeed, proved to be true; and the\\nparty were seen to gain the minor elevation only a short time after the\\ninvisible blasphemy had passed it.\\n\\nThen Wesley Corey, who had taken the glass, cried out that Armitage was\\nadjusting the sprayer which Rice held, and that something must be about\\nto happen. The crowd stirred uneasily, recalling that this sprayer was\\nexpected to give the unseen horror a moment of visibility. Two or three\\nmen shut their eyes, but Curtis Whateley snatched back the telescope\\nand strained his vision to the utmost. He saw that Rice, from the\\nparty\\'s point of vantage above and behind the entity, had an excellent\\nchance of spreading the potent powder with marvelous effect.\\n\\nThose without the telescope saw only an instant\\'s flash of gray\\ncloudâ\\x80\\x94a cloud about the size of a moderately large buildingâ\\x80\\x94near the\\ntop of the mountain. Curtis, who had held the instrument, dropped it\\nwith a piercing shriek into the ankle-deep mud of the road. He reeled,\\nand would have crumpled to the ground had not two or three others\\nseized and steadied him. All he could do was moan half-inaudibly:\\n\\n\"Oh, oh, great Gawd ... that ... that ....\"\\n\\n\"Oh, oh, great Gawd ... that ... that.\"\\n\\nThere was a pandemonium of questioning, and only Henry Wheeler thought\\nto rescue the fallen telescope and wipe it clean of mud. Curtis was\\npast all coherence, and even isolated replies were almost too much for\\nhim.\\n\\n\"Bigger \\'n a barn ... all made o\\' squirmin\\' ropes ... hull thing sort\\no\\' shaped like a hen\\'s egg bigger\\'n anything, with dozens o\\' legs like\\nhogsheads that haff shut up when they step ... nothin\\' solid abaout\\nitâ\\x80\\x94all like jelly, an\\' made o\\' sep\\'rit wrigglin\\' ropes pushed clost\\ntogether ... great bulgin\\' eyes all over it ... ten or twenty maouths\\nor trunks a-stickin\\' aout all along the sides, big as stovepipes, an\\'\\nall a-tossin\\' an\\' openin\\' an\\' shuttin\\' ... all gray, with kinder blue\\nor purple rings ... an\\' Gawd in Heavenâ\\x80\\x94that haff face on top !...\"\\n\\nThis final memory, whatever it was, proved too much for poor Curtis,\\nand he collapsed completely before he could say more. Fred Farr and\\nWill Hutchins carried him to the roadside and laid him on the damp\\ngrass. Henry Wheeler, trembling, turned the rescued telescope on the\\nmountain to see what he might. Through the lenses were discernible\\nthree tiny figures, apparently running toward the summit as fast as the\\nsteep incline allowed. Only theseâ\\x80\\x94nothing more. Then everyone noticed\\na strangely unseasonable noise in the deep valley behind, and even in\\nthe underbrush of Sentinel Hill itself. It was the piping of unnumbered\\nwhippoorwills, and in their shrill chorus there seemed to lurk a note\\nof tense and evil expectancy.\\n\\nEarl Sawyer now took the telescope and reported the three figures as\\nstanding on the topmost ridge, virtually level with the altar-stone\\nbut at a considerable distance from it. One figure, he said, seemed\\nto be raising its hands above its head at rhythmic intervals; and\\nas Sawyer mentioned the circumstance the crowd seemed to hear a\\nfaint, half-musical sound from the distance, as if a loud chant\\nwere accompanying the gestures. The weird silhouette on that\\nremote peak must have been a spectacle of infinite grotesqueness\\nand impressiveness, but no observer was in a mood for esthetic\\nappreciation. \"I guess he\\'s sayin\\' the spell,\" whispered Wheeler as\\nhe snatched back the telescope. The whippoorwills were piping wildly,\\nand in a singularly curious irregular rhythm quite unlike that of the\\nvisible ritual.\\n\\nSuddenly the sunshine seemed to lessen without the intervention of any\\ndiscernible cloud. It was a very peculiar phenomenon, and was plainly\\nmarked by all. A rumbling sound seemed brewing beneath the hills, mixed\\nstrangely with a concordant rumbling which clearly came from the sky.\\nLightning flashed aloft, and the wondering crowd looked in vain for\\nthe portents of storm. The chanting of the men from Arkham now became\\nunmistakable, and Wheeler saw through the glass that they were all\\nraising their arms in the rhythmic incantation. From some farmhouse far\\naway came the frantic barking of dogs.\\n\\nThe change in the quality of the daylight increased, and the crowd\\ngazed about the horizon in wonder. A purplish darkness, born of\\nnothing more than a spectral deepening of the sky\\'s blue, pressed down\\nupon the rumbling hills. Then the lightning flashed again, somewhat\\nbrighter than before, and the crowd fancied that it had showed a\\ncertain mistiness around the altar-stone on the distant height. No\\none, however, had been using the telescope at that instant. The\\nwhippoorwills continued their irregular pulsation, and the men of\\nDunwich braced themselves tensely against some imponderable menace with\\nwhich the atmosphere seemed surcharged.\\n\\nWithout warning came those deep, cracked, raucous vocal sounds which\\nwill never leave the memory of the stricken group who heard them. Not\\nfrom any human throat were they born, for the organs of man can yield\\nno such acoustic perversions. Rather would one have said they came\\nfrom the pit itself, had not their source been so unmistakably the\\naltar-stone on the peak. It is almost erroneous to call them sounds at all, since so much of their ghastly, infra-bass timbre spoke to\\ndim seats of consciousness and terror far subtler than the ear; yet\\none must do so, since their form was indisputably though vaguely that\\nof half-articulate words . They were loudâ\\x80\\x94loud as the rumblings and\\nthe thunder above which they echoedâ\\x80\\x94yet did they come from no visible\\nbeing. And because imagination might suggest a conjectural source in\\nthe world of non-visible beings, the huddled crowd at the mountain\\'s\\nbase huddled still closer, and winced as if in expectation of a blow.\\n\\n\" Ygnaiih ... ygnaiih ... thflthkh\\'ngha ... Yog-Sothoth.... \" rang the\\nhideous croaking out of space. \" Y\\'bthnk ... h\\'ehye ... n\\'grkdl\\'lh.... \"\\n\\nThe speaking impulse seemed to falter here, as if some frightful\\npsychic struggle were going on. Henry Wheeler strained his eye at\\nthe telescope, but saw only the three grotesquely silhouetted human\\nfigures on the peak, all moving their arms furiously in strange\\ngestures as their incantation drew near its culmination. From what\\nblack wells of Acherontic fear or feeling, from what unplumbed gulfs of\\nextra-cosmic consciousness or obscure, long-latent heredity, were those\\nhalf-articulate thunder-croakings drawn? Presently they began to gather\\nrenewed force and coherence as they grew in stark, utter, ultimate\\nfrenzy.\\n\\n\" Eh-ya-ya-ya-yahaah ... e\\'yaya-yayaaaa ... ngh\\'aaaa ... ngh\\'aaaa ...\\nh\\'yuh ... h\\'yuh ... HELP! HELP! ... ffâ\\x80\\x94ffâ\\x80\\x94ff â\\x80\\x94FATHER! FATHER!\\nYOG-SOTHOTH!...\"\\n\\nBut that was all. The pallid group in the road, still reeling at\\nthe indisputably English syllables that had poured thickly and\\nthunderously down from the frantic vacancy beside that shocking\\naltar-stone, were never to hear such syllables again. Instead, they\\njumped violently at the terrific report which seemed to rend the hills;\\nthe deafening, cataclysmic peal whose source, be it inner earth or\\nsky, no hearer was ever able to place. A single lightning bolt shot\\nfrom the purple zenith to the altar-stone, and a great tidal wave of\\nviewless force and indescribable stench swept down from the hill to\\nall the countryside. Trees, grass, and underbrush were whipped into a\\nfury; and the frightened crowd at the mountain\\'s base, weakened by the\\nlethal fetor that seemed about to asphyxiate them, were almost hurled\\noff their feet. Dogs howled from the distance, green grass and foliage\\nwilted to a curious, sickly yellow-gray, and over field and forest were\\nscattered the bodies of dead whippoorwills.\\n\\nThe stench left quickly, but the vegetation never came right again.\\nTo this day there is something queer and unholy about the growths on\\nand around that fearsome hill. Curtis Whateley was only just regaining\\nconsciousness when the Arkham men came slowly down the mountain in the\\nbeams of a sunlight once more brilliant and untainted. They were grave\\nand quiet, and seemed shaken by memories and reflections even more\\nterrible than those which had reduced the group of natives to a state\\nof cowed quivering. In reply to a jumble of questions they only shook\\ntheir heads and reaffirmed one vital fact.\\n\\n\"The thing has gone for ever,\" Armitage said. \"It has been split up\\ninto what it was originally made of, and can never exist again. It was\\nan impossibility in a normal world. Only the least fraction was really\\nmatter in any sense we know. It was like its fatherâ\\x80\\x94and most of it has\\ngone back to him in some vague realm or dimension outside our material\\nuniverse; some vague abyss out of which only the most accursed rites of\\nhuman blasphemy could ever have called him for a moment on the hills.\"\\n\\nThere was a brief silence, and in that pause the scattered senses of\\npoor Curtis Whateley began to knit back into a sort of continuity; so\\nthat he put his hands to his head with a moan. Memory seemed to pick\\nitself up where it had left off, and the horror of the sight that had\\nprostrated him burst in upon him again.\\n\\n\" Oh, oh, my Gawd, that haff face ... that haff face on top of it ...\\nthat face with the red eyes an\\' crinkly albino hair, an\\' no chin, like\\nthe Whateleys.... It was a octopus, centipede, spider kind o\\' thing,\\nbut they was a haff-shaped man\\'s face on top of it, an\\' it looked like\\nWizard Whateley\\'s, only it was yards an\\' yards acrost.... \"\\n\\nHe paused exhausted, as the whole group of natives stared in a\\nbewilderment not quite crystallized into fresh terror. Only old Zebulon\\nWhateley, who wanderingly remembered ancient things but who had been\\nsilent heretofore, spoke aloud.\\n\\n\"Fifteen year\\' gone,\" he rambled, \"I heerd Ol\\' Whateley say as haow\\nsome day we\\'d hear a child o\\' Lavinny\\'s a-callin\\' its father\\'s name on\\nthe top o\\' Sentinel Hill....\"\\n\\nBut Joe Osborn interrupted him to question the Arkham men anew.\\n\\n\" What was it, anyhaow , an\\' haowever did young Wizard Whateley call it\\naout o\\' the air it come from?\"\\n\\nArmitage chose his words carefully.\\n\\n\"It wasâ\\x80\\x94well, it was mostly a kind of force that doesn\\'t belong in our\\npart of space; a kind of force that acts and grows and shapes itself\\nby other laws than those of our sort of Nature. We have no business\\ncalling in such things from outside, and only very wicked people\\nand very wicked cults ever try to. There was some of it in Wilbur\\nWhateley himselfâ\\x80\\x94enough to make a devil and a precocious monster of\\nhim, and to make his passing out a pretty terrible sight. I\\'m going\\nto burn his accursed diary, and if you men are wise you\\'ll dynamite\\nthat altar-stone up there, and pull down all the rings of standing\\nstones on the other hills. Things like that brought down the beings\\nthose Whateleys were so fond ofâ\\x80\\x94the beings they were going to let in\\ntangibly to wipe out the human race and drag the earth off to some\\nnameless place for some nameless purpose.\\n\\n\"But as to this thing we\\'ve just sent backâ\\x80\\x94the Whateleys raised it for\\na terrible part in the doings that were to come. It grew fast and big\\nfrom the same reason that Wilbur grew fast and bigâ\\x80\\x94but it beat him\\nbecause it had a greater share of the outsideness in it. You needn\\'t\\nask how Wilbur called it out of the air. He didn\\'t call it out. It was\\nhis twin brother, but it looked more like the father than he did. \"',\n",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\\n\\nHere is a totally different story that we can highly recommend to you. We could wax rhapsodical in our praise, as the story is one of the finest pieces of literature it has been our good fortune to read. The theme is original, and yet fantastic enough to make it rise head and shoulders above many contemporary scientifiction stories. You will not regret having read this marvellous tale.\\n\\nWest of Arkham the hills rise wild, and there are valleys with deep\\nwoods that no axe has ever cut. There are dark narrow glens where the\\ntrees slope fantastically, and where thin brooklets trickle without\\never having caught the glint of sunlight. On the gentler slopes there\\nare farms, ancient and rocky, with squat, moss-coated cottages brooding\\neternally over old New England secrets in the lee of great ledges; but\\nthese are all vacant now, the wide chimneys crumbling and the shingled\\nsides bulging perilously beneath low gambrel roofs.\\n\\nThe old folk have gone away, and foreigners do not like to live there.\\nFrench-Canadians have tried it, Italians have tried it, and the Poles\\nhave come and departed. It is not because of anything that can be seen\\nor heard or handled, but because of something that is imagined. The\\nplace is not good for imagination, and does not bring restful dreams at\\nnight. It must be this which keeps the foreigners away, for old Ammi\\nPierce has never told them of anything he recalls from the strange\\ndays. Ammi, whose head has been a little queer for years, is the only\\none who still remains, or who ever talks of the strange days; and he\\ndares to do this because his house is so near the open fields and the\\ntravelled roads around Arkham.\\n\\nThere was once a road over the hills and through the valleys, that ran\\nstraight where the blasted heath is now; but people ceased to use it\\nand a new road was laid curving far toward the south. Traces of the\\nold one can still be found amidst the weeds of a returning wilderness,\\nand some of them will doubtless linger even when half the hollows are\\nflooded for the new reservoir. Then the dark woods will be cut down and\\nthe blasted heath will slumber far below blue waters whose surface will\\nmirror the sky and ripple in the sun. And the secrets of the strange\\ndays will be one with the deep\\'s secrets; one with the hidden lore of\\nold ocean, and all the mystery of primal earth.\\n\\nWhen I went into the hills and vales to survey for the new reservoir\\nthey told me the place was evil. They told me this in Arkham, and\\nbecause that is a very old town full of witch legends I thought the\\nevil must be something which grandmas had whispered to children\\nthrough centuries. The name \"blasted heath\" seemed to me very odd\\nand theatrical, and I wondered how it had come into the folklore of\\na Puritan people. Then I saw that dark westward tangle of glens and\\nslopes for myself, and ceased to wonder at anything besides its own\\nelder mystery. It was morning when I saw it, but shadow lurked always\\nthere. The trees grew too thickly, and their trunks were too big for\\nany healthy New England wood. There was too much silence in the dim\\nalleys between them, and the floor was too soft with the dank moss and\\nmattings of infinite years of decay.\\n\\nIn the open spaces, mostly along the line of the old road, there were\\nlittle hillside farms; sometimes with all the buildings standing,\\nsometimes with only one or two, and sometimes with only a lone chimney\\nor fast-filling cellar. Weeds and briers reigned, and furtive wild\\nthings rustled in the undergrowth. Upon everything was a haze of\\nrestlessness and oppression; a touch of the unreal and the grotesque,\\nas if some vital element of perspective or chiaroscuro were awry. I did\\nnot wonder that the foreigners would not stay, for this was no region\\nto sleep in. It was too much like a landscape of Salvator Rosa; too\\nmuch like some forbidden woodcut in a tale of terror.\\n\\nBut even all this was not so bad as the blasted heath. I knew it the\\nmoment I came upon it at the bottom of a spacious valley; for no other\\nname could fit such thing, or any other thing fit such a name. It\\nwas as if the poet had coined the phrase from having seen this one\\nparticular region. It must, I thought as I viewed it, be the outcome\\nof a fire; but why had nothing new ever grown over those five acres of\\ngrey desolation that sprawled open to the sky like a great spot eaten\\nby acid in the woods and fields? It lay largely to the north of the\\nancient road line, but encroached a little on the other side. I felt\\nan odd reluctance about approaching, and did so at last only because\\nmy business took me through and past it. There was no vegetation of\\nany kind on that broad expanse, but only a fine grey dust or ash which\\nno wind seemed ever to blow about. The trees near it were sickly\\nand stunted, and many dead trunks stood or lay rotting at the rim.\\nAs I walked hurriedly by I saw the tumbled bricks and stones of an\\nold chimney and cellar on my right, and the yawning black maw of an\\nabandoned well whose stagnant vapours played strange tricks with the\\nhues of the sunlight. Even the long, dark woodland climb beyond seemed\\nwelcome in contrast, and I marvelled no more at the frightened whispers\\nof Arkham people. There had been no house or ruin near; even in the\\nold days the place must have been lonely and remote. And at twilight,\\ndreading to repass that ominous spot, I walked circuitously back to the\\ntown by the curving road on the south. I vaguely wished some clouds\\nwould gather, for an odd timidity about the deep skyey voids above had\\ncrept into my soul.\\n\\nIn the evening I asked old people in Arkham about the blasted heath,\\nand what was meant by that phrase \"strange days\" which so many\\nevasively muttered. I could not, however, get any good answers, except\\nthat all the mystery was much more recent than I had dreamed. It was\\nnot a matter of old legendry at all, but something within the lifetime\\nof those who spoke. It had happened in the \\'eighties, and a family had\\ndisappeared or was killed. Speakers would not be exact; and because\\nthey all told me to pay no attention to old Ammi Pierce\\'s crazy tales,\\nI sought him out the next morning, having heard that he lived alone in\\nthe ancient tottering cottage where the trees first begin to get very\\nthick. It was a fearsomely ancient place, and had begun to exude the\\nfaint miasmal odour which clings about houses that have stood too long.\\nOnly with persistent knocking could I rouse the aged man, and when he\\nshuffled timidly to the door I could tell he was not glad to see me. He\\nwas not so feeble as I had expected; but his eyes drooped in a curious\\nway, and his unkempt clothing and white beard made him seem very worn\\nand dismal.\\n\\nNot knowing just how he could best be launched on his tales, I feigned\\na matter of business; told him of my surveying, and asked vague\\nquestions about the district. He was far brighter and more educated\\nthan I had been led to think, and before I knew it had grasped quite\\nas much of the subject as any man I had talked with in Arkham. He was\\nnot like other rustics I had known in the sections where reservoirs\\nwere to be. From him there were no protests at the miles of old wood\\nand farmland to be blotted out, though perhaps there would have been\\nhad not his home lain outside the bounds of the future lake. Relief\\nwas all that he showed; relief at the doom of the dark ancient valleys\\nthrough which he had roamed all his life. They were better under water\\nnowâ\\x80\\x94better under water since the strange days. And with this opening\\nhis husky voice sank low, while his body leaned forward and his right\\nforefinger began to point shakily and impressively.\\n\\nIt was then that I heard the story, and as the rambling voice scraped\\nand whispered on I shivered again and again despite the summer day.\\nOften I had to recall the speaker from ramblings, piece out scientific\\npoints which he knew only by a fading parrot memory of professors\\'\\ntalk, or bridge over gaps, where his sense of logic and continuity\\nbroke down. When he was done I did not wonder that his mind had snapped\\na trifle, or that the folk of Arkham would not speak much of the\\nblasted heath. I hurried back before sunset to my hotel, unwilling to\\nhave the stars come out above me in the open; and the next day returned\\nto Boston to give up my position. I could not go into that dim chaos\\nof old forest and slope again, or face another time that grey blasted\\nheath where the black well yawned deep beside the tumbled bricks and\\nstones. The reservoir will soon be built now, and all those elder\\nsecrets will lie safe forever under watery fathoms. But even then I do\\nnot believe I would like to visit that country by nightâ\\x80\\x94at least not\\nwhen the sinister stars are out; and nothing could bribe me to drink\\nthe new city water of Arkham.\\n\\nIt all began, old Ammi said, with the meteorite. Before that time there\\nhad been no wild legends at all since the witch trials, and even then\\nthese western woods were not feared half so much as the small island\\nin the Miskatonic where the devil held court beside a curious stone\\naltar older than the Indians. These were not haunted woods, and their\\nfantastic dusk was never terrible till the strange days. Then there\\nhad come that white noontide cloud, that string of explosions in the\\nair, and that pillar of smoke from the valley far in the wood. And by\\nnight all Arkham had heard of the great rock that fell out of the sky\\nand bedded itself in the ground beside the well at the Nahum Gardner\\nplace. That was the house which had stood where the blasted heath was\\nto comeâ\\x80\\x94the trim white Nahum Gardner house amidst its fertile gardens\\nand orchards.\\n\\nNahum had come to town to tell people about the stone, and had dropped\\nin at Ammi Pierce\\'s on the way. Ammi was forty then, and all the queer\\nthings were fixed very strongly in his mind. He and his wife had gone\\nwith the three professors from Miskatonic University who hastened out\\nthe next morning to see the weird visitor from unknown stellar space,\\nand had wondered why Nahum had called it so large the day before. It\\nhad shrunk, Nahum said as he pointed out the big brownish mound above\\nthe ripped earth and charred grass near the archaic well-sweep in his\\nfront yard; but the wise men answered that stones do not shrink. Its\\nheat lingered persistently, and Nahum declared it had glowed faintly in\\nthe night. The professors tried it with a geologist\\'s hammer and found\\nit was oddly soft. It was, in truth, so soft as to be almost plastic;\\nand they gouged rather than chipped a specimen to take back to the\\ncollege for testing. They took it in an old pail borrowed from Nahum\\'s\\nkitchen, for even the small piece refused to grow cool. On the trip\\nback they stopped at Ammi\\'s to rest, and seemed thoughtful when Mrs.\\nPierce remarked that the fragment was growing smaller and burning the\\nbottom of the pail. Truly, it was not large, but perhaps they had taken\\nless than they thought.\\n\\nThe day after thatâ\\x80\\x94all this was in June of \\'82â\\x80\\x94the professors had\\ntrooped out again in a great excitement. As they passed Ammi\\'s they\\ntold him what queer things the specimen had done, and how it had\\nfaded wholly away when they put it in a glass beaker. The beaker had\\ngone, too, and the wise men talked of the strange stone\\'s affinity\\nfor silicon. It had acted quite unbelievably in that well-ordered\\nlaboratory; doing nothing at all and showing no occluded gases when\\nheated on charcoal, being wholly negative in the borax bead, and soon\\nproving itself absolutely non-volatile at any producible temperature,\\nincluding that of the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe. On an anvil it appeared\\nhighly malleable, and in the dark its luminosity was very marked.\\nStubbornly refusing to grow cool, it soon had the college in a state\\nof real excitement; and when upon heating before the spectroscope it\\ndisplayed shining bands unlike any known colours of the normal spectrum\\nthere was much breathless talk of new elements, bizarre optical\\nproperties, and other things which puzzled men of science are wont to\\nsay when faced by the unknown.\\n\\nHot as it was, they tested it in a crucible with all the proper\\nreagents. Water did nothing. Hydrochloric acid was the same. Nitric\\nacid and even aqua regia merely hissed and spattered against its torrid\\ninvulnerability. Ammi had difficulty in recalling all these things, but\\nrecognized some solvents as I mentioned them in the usual order of use.\\nThere were ammonia and caustic soda, alcohol and ether, nauseous carbon\\ndisulphide and a dozen others; but although the weight grew steadily\\nless as time passed, and the fragment seemed to be slightly cooling,\\nthere was no change in the solvents to show that they had attacked\\nthe substance at all. It was a metal, though, beyond a doubt. It was\\nmagnetic, for one thing; and after its immersion in the acid solvents\\nthere seemed to be faint traces of the WidmÃ¤nstÃ¤tten figures found\\non meteoric iron. When the cooling had grown very considerable, the\\ntesting was carried on in glass; and it was in a glass beaker that they\\nleft all the chips made of the original fragment during the work. The\\nnext morning both chips and beaker were gone without trace, and only a\\ncharred spot marked the place on the wooden shelf where they had been.\\n\\nAll this the professors told Ammi as they paused at his door, and\\nonce more he went with them to see the stony messenger from the\\nstars, though this time his wife did not accompany him. It had now\\nmost certainly shrunk, and even the sober professors could not doubt\\nthe truth of what they saw. All around the dwindling brown lump near\\nthe well was a vacant space, except where the earth had caved in;\\nand whereas it had been a good seven feet across the day before, it\\nwas now scarcely five. It was still hot, and the sages studied its\\nsurface curiously as they detached another and larger piece with hammer\\nand chisel. They gouged deeply this time, and as they pried away\\nthe smaller mass they saw that the core of the thing was not quite\\nhomogeneous.\\n\\nThey had uncovered what seemed to be the side of a large coloured\\nglobule embedded in the substance. The colour, which resembled some\\nof the bands in the meteor\\'s strange spectrum, was almost impossible\\nto describe; and it was only by analogy that they called it colour at\\nall. Its texture was glossy, and upon tapping it appeared to promise\\nboth brittleness and hollowness. One of the professors gave it a smart\\nblow with a hammer, and it burst with a nervous little pop. Nothing was\\nemitted, and all trace of the thing vanished with the puncturing. It\\nleft behind a hollow spherical space about three inches across, and all\\nthought it probable that others would be discovered as the enclosing\\nsubstance wasted away.\\n\\nConjecture was vain; so after a futile attempt to find additional\\nglobules by drilling, the seekers left again with their new\\nspecimenâ\\x80\\x94which proved, however, as baffling in the laboratory as\\nits predecessor. Aside from being almost plastic, having heat,\\nmagnetism, and slight luminosity, cooling slightly in powerful acids,\\npossessing an unknown spectrum, wasting away in air, and attacking\\nsilicon compounds with mutual destruction as a result, it presented\\nno identifying features whatsoever; and at the end of the tests the\\ncollege scientists were forced to own that they could not place it. It\\nwas nothing of this earth, but a piece of the great outside; and as\\nsuch dowered with outside properties and obedient to outside laws.\\n\\nThat night there was a thunderstorm, and when the professors went out\\nto Nahum\\'s the next day they met with a bitter disappointment. The\\nstone, magnetic as it had been, must have had some peculiar electrical\\nproperty; for it had \"drawn the lightning,\" as Nahum said, with a\\nsingular persistence. Six times within an hour the farmer saw the\\nlightning strike the furrow in the front yard, and when the storm was\\nover nothing remained but a ragged pit by the ancient well-sweep,\\nhalf-chocked with caved-in earth. Digging had borne no fruit, and the\\nscientists verified the fact of the utter vanishment. The failure was\\ntotal; so that nothing was left to do but go back to the laboratory and\\ntest again the disappearing fragment left carefully cased in lead. That\\nfragment lasted a week, at the end of which nothing of value had been\\nlearned of it. When it had gone, no residue was left behind, and in\\ntime the professors felt scarcely sure they had indeed seen with waking\\neyes that cryptic vestige of the fathomless gulfs outside; that lone,\\nweird message from other universes and other realms of matter, force,\\nand entity.\\n\\nAs was natural, the Arkham papers made much of the incident with its\\ncollegiate sponsoring, and sent reporters to talk with Nahum Gardner\\nand his family. At least one Boston daily also sent a scribe, and Nahum\\nquickly became a kind of local celebrity. He was a lean, genial person\\nof about fifty, living with his wife and three sons on the pleasant\\nfarmstead in the valley. He and Ammi exchanged visits frequently, as\\ndid their wives; and Ammi had nothing but praise for him after all\\nthese years. He seemed slightly proud of the notice his place had\\nattracted, and talked often of the meteorite in the succeeding weeks.\\nThat July and August were hot; and Nahum worked hard at his haying in\\nthe ten-acre pasture across Chapman\\'s Brook; his rattling wain wearing\\ndeep ruts in the shadowy lanes between. The labour tired him more than\\nit had in other years, and he felt that age was beginning to tell on\\nhim.\\n\\nThen fell the time of fruit and harvest. The pears and apples slowly\\nripened, and Nahum vowed that his orchards were prospering as never\\nbefore. The fruit was growing to phenomenal size and unwonted gloss,\\nand in such abundance that extra barrels were ordered to handle the\\nfuture crop. But with the ripening came sore disappointment, for of all\\nthat gorgeous array of specious lusciousness not one single jot was\\nfit to eat. Into the fine flavour of the pears and apples had crept\\na stealthy bitterness and sickishness, so that even the smallest of\\nbites induced a lasting disgust. It was the same with the melons and\\ntomatoes, and Nahum sadly saw that his entire crop was lost. Quick to\\nconnect events, he declared that the meteorite had poisoned the soil,\\nand thanked Heaven that most of the other crops were in the upland lot\\nalong the road.\\n\\nWinter came early, and was very cold. Ammi saw Nahum less often than\\nusual, and observed that he had begun to look worried. The rest of his\\nfamily too, seemed to have grown taciturn; and were far from steady\\nin their churchgoing or their attendance at the various social events\\nof the countryside. For this reserve or melancholy no cause could be\\nfound, though all the household confessed now and then to poorer health\\nand a feeling of vague disquiet. Nahum himself gave the most definite\\nstatement of anyone when he said he was disturbed about certain\\nfootprints in the snow. They were the usual winter prints of red\\nsquirrels, white rabbits, and foxes, but the brooding farmer professed\\nto see something not quite right about their nature and arrangement.\\nHe was never specific, but appeared to think that they were not as\\ncharacteristic of the anatomy and habits of squirrels and rabbits and\\nfoxes as they ought to be. Ammi listened without interest to this talk\\nuntil one night when he drove past Nahum\\'s house in his sleigh on the\\nway back from Clark\\'s Corners. There had been a moon, and a rabbit had\\nrun across the road; and the leaps of that rabbit were longer than\\neither Ammi or his horse liked. The latter, indeed, had almost run away\\nwhen brought up by a firm rein. Thereafter Ammi gave Nahum\\'s tales\\nmore respect, and wondered why the Gardner dogs seemed so cowed and\\nquivering every morning. They had, it developed, nearly lost the spirit\\nto bark.\\n\\nIn February the McGregor boys from Meadow Hill were out shooting\\nwoodchucks, and not far from the Gardner place bagged a very peculiar\\nspecimen. The proportions of its body seemed slightly altered in a\\nqueer way impossible to describe, while its face had taken on an\\nexpression which no one ever saw in a woodchuck before. The boys were\\ngenuinely frightened, and threw the thing away at once, so that only\\ntheir grotesque tales of it ever reached the people of the countryside.\\nBut the shying of horses near Nahum\\'s house had now become an\\nacknowledged thing, and all the basis for a cycle of whispered legend\\nwas fast taking form.\\n\\nPeople vowed that the snow melted faster around Nahum\\'s than it did\\nanywhere else, and early in March there was an awed discussion in\\nPotter\\'s general store at Clark\\'s Corners. Stephen Rice had driven past\\nGardner\\'s in the morning, and had noticed the skunk-cabbages coming\\nup through the mud by the woods across the road. Never were things of\\nsuch size seen before, and they held strange colours that could not\\nbe put into any words. Their shapes were monstrous, and the horse had\\nsnorted at an odour which struck Stephen as wholly unprecedented. That\\nafternoon several persons drove past to see the abnormal growth, and\\nall agreed that plants of that kind ought never to sprout in a healthy\\nworld. The bad fruit of the fall before was freely mentioned, and it\\nwent from mouth to mouth that there was poison in Nahum\\'s ground. Of\\ncourse it was the meteorite; and remembering how strange the men from\\nthe college had found that stone to be, several farmers spoke about the\\nmatter to them.\\n\\nOne day they paid Nahum a visit; but having no love of wild tales and\\nfolklore were very conservative in what they inferred. The plants were\\ncertainly odd, but all skunk-cabbages are more or less odd in shape\\nand hue. Perhaps some mineral element from the stone had entered the\\nsoil, but it would soon be washed away. And as for the footprints and\\nfrightened horsesâ\\x80\\x94of course this was mere country talk which such\\na phenomenon as the aerolite would be certain to start. There was\\nreally nothing for serious men to do in cases of wild gossip, for\\nsuperstitious rustics will say and believe anything. And so all through\\nthe strange days the professors stayed away in contempt. Only one\\nof them, when given two phials of dust for analysis in a police job\\nover a year and a half later, recalled that the queer colour of that\\nskunk-cabbage had been very like one of the anomalous bands of light\\nshown by the meteor fragment in the college spectroscope, and like the\\nbrittle globule found imbedded in the stone from the abyss. The samples\\nin this analysis case gave the same odd bands at first, though later\\nthey lost the property.\\n\\nThe trees budded prematurely around Nahum\\'s, and at night they swayed\\nominously in the wind. Nahum\\'s second son Thaddeus, a lad of fifteen,\\nswore that they swayed also when there was no wind; but even the\\ngossips would not credit this. Certainly, however, restlessness was\\nin the air. The entire Gardner family developed the habit of stealthy\\nlistening, though not for any sound which they could consciously\\nname. The listening was, indeed, rather a product of moments when\\nconsciousness seemed half to slip away. Unfortunately such moments\\nincreased week by week, till it became common speech that \"something\\nwas wrong with all Nahum\\'s folks.\" When the early saxifrage came out it\\nhad another strange colour; not quite like that of the skunk-cabbage,\\nbut plainly related and equally unknown to anyone who saw it. Nahum\\ntook some blossoms to Arkham and showed them to the editor of the Gazette , but that dignitary did no more than write a humorous article\\nabout them, in which the dark fears of rustics were held up to polite\\nridicule. It was a mistake of Nahum\\'s to tell a stolid city man about\\nthe way the great, overgrown mourning-cloak butterflies behaved in\\nconnection with these saxifrages.\\n\\nApril brought a kind of madness to the country folk, and began that\\ndisuse of the road past Nahum\\'s which led to its ultimate abandonment.\\nIt was next the vegetation. All the orchard trees blossomed forth in\\nstrange colours, and through the stony soil of the yard and adjacent\\npasturage there sprang up a bizarre growth which only a botanist could\\nconnect with the proper flora of the region. No sane wholesome colours\\nwere anywhere to be seen except in the green grass and leafage; but\\neverywhere were those hectic and prismatic variants of some diseased,\\nunderlying primary tone without a place among the known tints of earth.\\nThe \"Dutchman\\'s breeches\" became a thing of sinister menace, and the\\nbloodroots grew insolent in their chromatic perversion. Ammi and the\\nGardners thought that most of the colours had a sort of haunting\\nfamiliarity, and decided that they reminded one of the brittle globule\\nin the meteor. Nahum ploughed and sowed the ten-acre pasture and the\\nupland lot, but did nothing with the land around the house. He knew it\\nwould be of no use, and hoped that the summer\\'s strange growths would\\ndraw all the poison from the soil. He was prepared for almost anything\\nnow, and had grown used to the sense of something near him waiting\\nto be heard. The shunning of his house by neighbours told on him, of\\ncourse; but it told on his wife more. The boys were better off, being\\nat school each day; but they could not help being frightened by the\\ngossip. Thaddeus, an especially sensitive youth, suffered the most.\\n\\nIn May the insects came, and Nahum\\'s place became a nightmare of\\nbuzzing and crawling. Most of the creatures seemed not quite usual in\\ntheir aspects and motions, and their nocturnal habits contradicted all\\nformer experience. The Gardners took to watching at nightâ\\x80\\x94watching in\\nall directions at random for something they could not tell what. It was\\nthen that they all owned that Thaddeus had been right about the trees.\\nMrs. Gardner was the next to see it from the window as she watched the\\nswollen boughs of a maple against a moonlit sky. The boughs surely\\nmoved, and there was no wind. It must be the sap. Strangeness had come\\ninto everything growing now. Yet it was none of Nahum\\'s family at all\\nwho made the next discovery. Familiarity had dulled them, and what they\\ncould not see was glimpsed by a timid windmill salesman from Bolton who\\ndrove by one night in ignorance of the country legends. What he told in\\nArkham was given a short paragraph in the Gazette ; and it was there\\nthat all the farmers, Nahum included, saw it first. The night had been\\ndark and the buggy-lamps faint, but around a farm in the valley which\\neveryone knew from the account must be Nahum\\'s, the darkness had been\\nless thick. A dim though distinct luminosity seemed to inhere in all\\nthe vegetation, grass, leaves, and blossoms alike, while at one moment\\na detached piece of the phosphorescence appeared to stir furtively in\\nthe yard near the barn.\\n\\nThe grass had so far seemed untouched, and the cows were freely\\npastured in the lot near the house, but toward the end of May the milk\\nbegan to be bad. Then Nahum had the cows driven to the uplands, after\\nwhich this trouble ceased. Not long after this the change in grass and\\nleaves became apparent to the eye. All the verdure was going grey,\\nand was developing a highly singular quality of brittleness. Ammi\\nwas now the only person who ever visited the place, and his visits\\nwere becoming fewer and fewer. When school closed the Gardners were\\nvirtually cut off from the world, and sometimes let Ammi do their\\nerrands in town. They were failing curiously both physically and\\nmentally, and no one was surprised when the news of Mrs. Gardner\\'s\\nmadness stole around.\\n\\nIt happened in June, about the anniversary of the meteor\\'s fall, and\\nthe poor woman screamed about things in the air which she could not\\ndescribe. In her raving there was not a single specific noun, but\\nonly verbs and pronouns. Things moved and changed and fluttered, and\\nears tingled to impulses which were not wholly sounds. Something\\nwas taken awayâ\\x80\\x94she was being drained of somethingâ\\x80\\x94something was\\nfastening itself on her that ought not to beâ\\x80\\x94someone must make it\\nkeep offâ\\x80\\x94nothing was ever still in the nightâ\\x80\\x94the walls and windows\\nshifted. Nahum did not send her to the county asylum, but let her\\nwander about the house as long as she was harmless to herself and\\nothers. Even when her expression changed he did nothing. But when the\\nboys grew afraid of her, and Thaddeus nearly fainted at the way she\\nmade faces at him, he decided to keep her locked in the attic. By July\\nshe had ceased to speak and crawled on all fours, and before that month\\nwas over Nahum got the mad notion that she was slightly luminous in the\\ndark, as he now clearly saw was the case with the nearby vegetation.\\n\\nIt was a little before this that the horses had stampeded. Something\\nhad aroused them in the night, and their neighing and kicking in their\\nstalls had been terrible. There seemed virtually nothing to do to calm\\nthem, and when Nahum opened the stable door they all bolted out like\\nfrightened woodland deer. It took a week to track all four, and when\\nfound they were seen to be quite useless and unmanageable. Something\\nhad snapped in their brains, and each one had to be shot for its own\\ngood. Nahum borrowed a horse from Ammi for his haying, but found it\\nwould not approach the barn. It shied, balked, and whinnied, and in\\nthe end he could do nothing but drive it into the yard while the men\\nused their own strength to get the heavy wagon near enough the hayloft\\nfor convenient pitching. And all the while the vegetation was turning\\ngrey and brittle. Even the flowers whose hues had been so strange\\nwere graying now, and the fruit was coming out grey and dwarfed and\\ntasteless. The asters and goldenrod bloomed grey and distorted, and\\nthe roses and zinnias and hollyhocks in the front yard were such\\nblasphemous-looking things that Nahum\\'s oldest boy Zenas cut them down.\\nThe strangely puffed insects died about that time, even the bees that\\nhad left their hives and taken to the woods.\\n\\nBy September all the vegetation was fast crumbling to a greyish\\npowder, and Nahum feared that the trees would die before the poison\\nwas out of the soil. His wife now had spells of terrific screaming,\\nand he and the boys were in a constant state of nervous tension.\\nThey shunned people now, and when school opened the boys did not go.\\nBut it was Ammi, on one of his rare visits, who first realized that\\nthe well water was no longer good. It had an evil taste that was not\\nexactly fetid nor exactly salty, and Ammi advised his friend to dig\\nanother well on higher ground to use till the soil was good again.\\nNahum, however, ignored the warning, for he had by that time become\\ncalloused to strange and unpleasant things. He and the boys continued\\nto use the tainted supply, drinking it as listlessly and mechanically\\nas they ate their meagre and ill-cooked meals and did their thankless\\nand monotonous chores through the aimless days. There was something of\\nstolid resignation about them all, as if they walked half in another\\nworld between lines of nameless guards to a certain and familiar doom.\\n\\nThaddeus went mad in September after a visit to the well. He had gone\\nwith a pail and had come back empty-handed, shrieking and waving his\\narms, and sometimes lapsing into an inane titter or a whisper about\\n\"the moving colours down there.\" Two in one family was pretty bad,\\nbut Nahum was very brave about it. He let the boy run about for a\\nweek until he began stumbling and hurting himself, and then he shut\\nhim in an attic room across the hall from his mother\\'s. The way they\\nscreamed at each other from behind their locked doors was very\\nterrible, especially to little Merwin, who fancied they talked in some\\nterrible language that was not of earth. Merwin was getting frightfully\\nimaginative, and his restlessness was worse after the shutting away of\\nthe brother who had been his greatest playmate.\\n\\nAlmost at the same time the mortality among the livestock commenced.\\nPoultry turned greyish and died very quickly, their meat being found\\ndry and noisome upon cutting. Hogs grew inordinately fat, then suddenly\\nbegan to undergo loathsome changes which no one could explain. Their\\nmeat was of course useless, and Nahum was at his wit\\'s end. No rural\\nveterinary would approach his place, and the city veterinary from\\nArkham was openly baffled. The swine began growing grey and brittle\\nand falling to pieces before they died, and their eyes and muzzles\\ndeveloped singular alterations. It was very inexplicable, for they had\\nnever been fed from the tainted vegetation. Then something struck the\\ncows. Certain areas or sometimes the whole body would be uncannily\\nshrivelled or compressed, and atrocious collapses or disintegrations\\nwere common. In the last stagesâ\\x80\\x94and death was always the resultâ\\x80\\x94there\\nwould be a greying and turning brittle like that which beset the hogs.\\nThere could be no question of poison, for all the cases occurred in a\\nlocked and undisturbed barn. No bites of prowling things could have\\nbrought the virus, for what live beast of earth can pass through solid\\nobstacles? It must be only natural diseaseâ\\x80\\x94yet what disease could\\nwreak such results was beyond any mind\\'s guessing. When the harvest\\ncame there was not an animal surviving on the place, for the stock\\nand poultry were dead and the dogs had run away. These dogs, three\\nin number, had all vanished one night and were never heard of again.\\nThe five cats had left some time before, but their going was scarcely\\nnoticed since there now seemed to be no mice, and only Mrs. Gardner had\\nmade pets of the graceful felines.\\n\\nOn the nineteenth of October Nahum staggered into Ammi\\'s house with\\nhideous news. The death had come to poor Thaddeus in his attic room,\\nand it had come in a way which could not be told. Nahum had dug a grave\\nin the railed family plot behind the farm, and had put therein what\\nhe found. There could have been nothing from outside, for the small\\nbarred window and locked door were intact; but it was much as it had\\nbeen in the barn. Ammi and his wife consoled the stricken man as best\\nthey could, but shuddered as they did so. Stark terror seemed to cling\\nround the Gardners and all they touched, and the very presence of one\\nin the house was a breath from regions unnamed and unnameable. Ammi\\naccompanied Nahum home with the greatest reluctance, and did what he\\nmight to calm the hysterical sobbing of little Merwin. Zenas needed no\\ncalming. He had come of late to do nothing but stare into space and\\nobey what his father told him; and Ammi thought that his fate was very\\nmerciful. Now and then Merwin\\'s screams were answered faintly from the\\nattic, and in response to an inquiring look Nahum said that his wife\\nwas getting very feeble. When night approached, Ammi managed to get\\naway; for not even friendship could make him stay in that spot when the\\nfaint glow of the vegetation began and the trees may or may not have\\nswayed without wind. It was really lucky for Ammi that he was not more\\nimaginative. Even as things were, his mind was bent ever so slightly;\\nbut had he been able to connect and reflect upon all the portents\\naround him he must inevitably have turned a total maniac. In the\\ntwilight he hastened home, the screams of the mad woman and the nervous\\nchild ringing horrible in his ears.\\n\\nThree days later Nahum burst into Ammi\\'s kitchen in the early morning,\\nand in the absence of his host stammered out a desperate tale once\\nmore, while Mrs. Pierce listened in a clutching fright. It was little\\nMerwin this time. He was gone. He had gone out late at night with a\\nlantern and pail for water, and had never come back. He\\'d been going\\nto pieces for days, and hardly knew what he was about. Screamed at\\neverything. There had been a frantic shriek from the yard then, but\\nbefore the father could get to the door the boy was gone. There was no\\nglow from the lantern he had taken, and of the child himself no trace.\\nAt the time Nahum thought the lantern and pail were gone too; but when\\ndawn came, and the man had plodded back from his all-night search of\\nthe woods and fields, he had found some very curious things near the\\nwell. There was a crushed and apparently somewhat melted mass of iron\\nwhich had certainly been the lantern; while a bent pail and twisted\\niron hoops beside it, both half-fused, seemed to hint at the remnants\\nof the pail. That was all. Nahum was past imagining, Mrs. Pierce was\\nblank, and Ammi, when he had reached home and heard the tale, could\\ngive no guess. Merwin was gone, and there would be no use in telling\\nthe people around, who shunned all Gardners now. No use, either, in\\ntelling the city people at Arkham who laughed at everything. Thad was\\ngone, and now Merwin was gone. Something was creeping and creeping and\\nwaiting to be seen and heard. Nahum would go soon, and he wanted Ammi\\nto look after his wife and Zenas if they survived him. It must all be a\\njudgment of some sort; though he could not fancy what for, since he had\\nalways walked uprightly in the Lord\\'s ways so far as he knew.\\n\\nFor over two weeks Ammi saw nothing of Nahum; and then, worried about\\nwhat might have happened, he overcame his fears and paid the Gardner\\nplace a visit. There was no smoke from the great chimney, and for a\\nmoment the visitor was apprehensive of the worst. The aspect of the\\nwhole farm was shockingâ\\x80\\x94greyish withered grass and leaves on the\\nground, vines falling in brittle wreckage from archaic walls and\\ngables, and great bare trees clawing up at the grey November sky with\\na studied malevolence which Ammi could not but feel had come from some\\nsubtle change in the tilt of the branches. But Nahum was alive, after\\nall. He was weak, and lying in a couch in the low-ceiled kitchen,\\nbut perfectly conscious and able to give simple orders to Zenas. The\\nroom was deadly cold; and as Ammi visibly shivered, the host shouted\\nhuskily to Zenas for more wood. Wood, indeed, was sorely needed; since\\nthe cavernous fireplace was unlit and empty, with a cloud of soot\\nblowing about in the chill wind that came down the chimney. Presently\\nNahum asked him if the extra wood had made him any more comfortable,\\nand then Ammi saw what had happened. The stoutest cord had broken at\\nlast, and the hapless farmer\\'s mind was proof against more sorrow.\\n\\nQuestioning tactfully, Ammi could get no clear data at all about the\\nmissing Zenas. \"In the wellâ\\x80\\x94he lives in the wellâ\\x80\\x94\" was all that the\\nclouded father would say. Then there flashed across the visitor\\'s mind\\na sudden thought of the mad wife, and he changed his line of inquiry.\\n\"Nabby? Why, here she is!\" was the surprised response of poor Nahum,\\nand Ammi soon saw that he must search for himself. Leaving the harmless\\nbabbler on the couch, he took the keys from their nail beside the door\\nand climbed the creaking stairs to the attic. It was very close and\\nnoisome up there, and no sound could be heard from any direction. Of\\nthe four doors in sight, only one was locked, and on this he tried\\nvarious keys on the ring he had taken. The third key proved the right\\none, and after some fumbling Ammi threw open the low white door.\\n\\nIt was quite dark inside, for the window was small and half-obscured\\nby the crude wooden bars; and Ammi could see nothing at all on the\\nwide-planked floor. The stench was beyond enduring, and before\\nproceeding further he had to retreat to another room and return\\nwith his lungs filled with breathable air. When he did enter he saw\\nsomething dark in the corner, and upon seeing it more clearly he\\nscreamed outright. While he screamed he thought a momentary cloud\\neclipsed the window, and a second later he felt himself brushed as if\\nby some hateful current of vapour. Strange colours danced before his\\neyes; and had not a present horror numbed him he would have thought of\\nthe globule in the meteor that the geologist\\'s hammer had shattered,\\nand of the morbid vegetation that had sprouted in the spring. As it\\nwas he thought only of the blasphemous monstrosity which confronted\\nhim, and which all too clearly had shared the nameless fate of young\\nThaddeus and the livestock. But the terrible thing about the horror was\\nthat it very slowly and perceptibly moved as it continued to crumble.\\n\\nAmmi would give me no added particulars of this scene, but the shape\\nin the corners does not re-appear in his tale as a moving object.\\nThere are things which cannot be mentioned, and what is done in common\\nhumanity is sometimes cruelly judged by the law. I gathered that no\\nmoving thing was left in that attic room, and that to leave anything\\ncapable of motion there would have been a deed so monstrous as to damn\\nany accountable being to eternal torment. Anyone but a stolid farmer\\nwould have fainted or gone mad, but Ammi walked conscious through that\\nlow doorway and locked the accursed secret behind him. There would be\\nNahum to deal with now; he must be fed and tended, and removed to some\\nplace where he could be cared for.\\n\\nCommencing his descent of the dark stairs, Ammi heard a thud below him.\\nHe even thought a scream had been suddenly choked off, and recalled\\nnervously the clammy vapour which had brushed by him in that frightful\\nroom above. What presence had his cry and entry started up? Halted by\\nsome vague fear, he heard still further sounds below. Indubitably there\\nwas a sort of heavy dragging, and a most detestably sticky noise as\\nof some fiendish and unclean species of suction. With an associative\\nsense goaded to feverish heights, he thought unaccountably of what he\\nhad seen upstairs. Good God! What eldritch dream-world was this into\\nwhich he had blundered? He dared move neither backward nor forward, but\\nstood there trembling at the black curve of the boxed-in staircase.\\nEvery trifle of the scene burned itself into his brain. The sounds, the\\nsense of dread expectancy, the darkness, the steepness of the narrow\\nstepsâ\\x80\\x94and merciful Heaven!â\\x80\\x94the faint but unmistakable luminosity of\\nall the woodwork in sight; steps, sides, exposed laths, and beams alike.\\n\\nThen there burst forth a frantic whinny from Ammi\\'s horse outside,\\nfollowed at once by a clatter which told of a frenzied runaway. In\\nanother moment horse and buggy had gone beyond earshot, leaving the\\nfrightened man on the dark stairs to guess what had sent them. But that\\nwas not all. There had been another sound out there. A sort of liquid\\nsplashâ\\x80\\x94waterâ\\x80\\x94it must have been the well. He had left Hero untied\\nnear it, and a buggy-wheel must have brushed the coping and knocked in\\na stone. And still the pale phosphorescense glowed in that detestably\\nancient woodwork. God! how old the house was! Most of it built before\\n1700.\\n\\nA feeble scratching on the floor downstairs now sounded distinctly, and\\nAmmi\\'s grip tightened on a heavy stick he had picked up in the attic\\nfor some purpose. Slowly nerving himself, he finished his descent and\\nwalked boldly toward the kitchen. But he did not complete the walk,\\nbecause what he sought was no longer there. It had come to meet him,\\nand it was still alive after a fashion. Whether it had crawled or\\nwhether it had been dragged by any external forces, Ammi could not\\nsay; but the death had been at it. Everything had happened in the last\\nhalf-hour, but collapse, greying, and disintegration were already far\\nadvanced. There was a horrible brittleness, and dry fragments were\\nscaling off. Ammi could not touch it, but looked horrifiedly into the\\ndistorted parody that had been a face. \"What was it, Nahumâ\\x80\\x94what\\nwas it?\" He whispered, and the cleft, bulging lips were just able to\\ncrackle out a final answer.\\n\\n\"Nothin\\' ... nothin\\' ... the colour ... it burns ... cold an\\' wet, but\\nit burns ... it lived in the well.... I seen it ... a kind o\\' smoke ...\\njest like the flowers last spring ... the well shone at night.... Thad\\nan\\' Merwin an\\' Zenas ... everything alive ... suckin\\' the life out of\\neverything ... in that stone ... it must o\\' come in that stone ...\\npizened the whole place ... dun\\'t know what it wants ... that round\\nthing them men from the college dug outen the stone ... they smashed\\nit ... it was that same colour ... jest the same, like the flowers an\\'\\nplants ... must a\\' ben more of \\'em ... seeds ... seeds ... they\\ngrowed ... I seen it the fust time this week ... must a\\' got strong\\non Zenas ... he was a big boy, full o\\' life ... it beats down your\\nmind an\\' then gits ye ... burns ye up ... in the well water ... you\\nwas right about that ... evil water ... Zenas never come back from the\\nwell ... can\\'t git away ... draws ye ... ye know summ\\'at\\'s comin\\', but\\n\\'tain\\'t no use ... I seen it time an\\' agin Zenas was took ... whar\\'s\\nNabby, Ammi? ... my head\\'s no good ... dun\\'t know how long sence I fed\\nher ... it\\'ll git her ef we ain\\'t keerful ... jest a colour ... her\\nface is gittin\\' to hev that colour sometimes towards night ... an\\' it\\nburns an\\' sucks ... it come from some place whar things ain\\'t as they\\nis here ... one o\\' them professors said so ... he was right ... look\\nout, Ammi, it\\'ll do suthin\\' more ... sucks the life out....\"\\n\\nBut that was all. That which spoke could speak no more because it had\\ncompletely caved in. Ammi laid a red checked tablecloth over what was\\nleft and reeled out the back door into the fields. He climbed the slope\\nto the ten-acre pasture and stumbled home by the north road and the\\nwoods. He could not pass that well from which his horses had run away.\\nHe had looked at it through the window, and had seen that no stone\\nwas missing from the rim. Then the lurching buggy had not dislodged\\nanything after allâ\\x80\\x94the splash had been something elseâ\\x80\\x94something which\\nwent into the well after it had done with poor Nahum....\\n\\nWhen Ammi reached his house the horses and buggy had arrived before\\nhim and thrown his wife into fits of anxiety. Reassuring her without\\nexplanations, he set out at once for Arkham and notified the\\nauthorities that the Gardner family was no more. He indulged in no\\ndetails, but merely told of the deaths of Nahum and Nabby, that of\\nThaddeus being already known, and mentioned that the cause seemed to\\nbe the same strange ailment which had killed the livestock. He also\\nstated that Merwin and Zenas had disappeared. There was considerable\\nquestioning at the police station, and in the end Ammi was compelled\\nto take three officers to the Gardner farm, together with the coroner,\\nthe medical examiner, and the veterinary who had treated the diseased\\nanimals. He went much against his will, for the afternoon was advancing\\nand he feared the fall of night over that accursed place, but it was\\nsome comfort to have so many people with him.\\n\\nThe six men drove out in a democrat-wagon, following Ammi\\'s buggy, and\\narrived at the pest-ridden farmhouse about four o\\'clock. Used as the\\nofficers were to gruesome experiences, not one remained unmoved at\\nwhat was found in the attic and under the red checked tablecloth on\\nthe floor below. The whole aspect of the farm with its grey desolation\\nwas terrible enough, but those two crumbling objects were beyond all\\nbounds. No one could look long at them, and even the medical examiner\\nadmitted that there was very little to examine. Specimens could be\\nanalysed, of course, so he busied himself in obtaining themâ\\x80\\x94and here\\nit develops that a very puzzling aftermath occurred at the college\\nlaboratory where the two phials of dust were finally taken. Under the\\nspectroscope both samples gave off an unknown spectrum, in which many\\nof the baffling bands were precisely like those which the strange\\nmeteor had yielded in the previous year. The property of emitting this\\nspectrum vanished in a month, the dust thereafter consisting mainly of\\nalkaline phosphates and carbonates.\\n\\nAmmi would not have told the men about the well if he had thought they\\nmeant to do anything then and there. It was getting toward sunset, and\\nhe was anxious to be away. But he could not help glancing nervously\\nat the stony curb by the great sweep, and when a detective questioned\\nhim he admitted that Nahum had feared something down thereâ\\x80\\x94so much so\\nthat he had never even thought of searching it for Merwin or Zenas.\\nAfter that nothing would do but that they empty and explore the well\\nimmediately, so Ammi had to wait trembling while pail after pail of\\nrank water was hauled up and splashed on the soaking ground outside.\\nThe men sniffed in disgust at the fluid, and toward the last held their\\nnoses against the foetor they were uncovering. It was not so long a\\njob as they had feared it would be, since the water was phenomenally\\nlow. There is no need to speak too exactly of what they found. Merwin\\nand Zenas were both there, in part, though the vestiges were mainly\\nskeletal. There were also a small deer and a large dog in about the\\nsame state, and a number of bones of smaller animals. The ooze and\\nslime at the bottom seemed inexplicably porous and bubbling, and a man\\nwho descended on hand-holds with a long pole found that he could sink\\nthe wooden shaft to any depth in the mud of the floor without meeting\\nany solid obstruction.\\n\\nTwilight had now fallen, and lanterns were brought from the house.\\nThen, when it was seen that nothing further could be gained from the\\nwell, everyone went indoors and conferred in the ancient sitting-room\\nwhile the intermittent light of a spectral half-moon played wanly on\\nthe grey desolation outside. The men were frankly nonplussed by the\\nentire case, and could find no convincing common element to link the\\nstrange vegetable conditions, the unknown disease of livestock and\\nhumans, and the unaccountable deaths of Merwin and Zenas in the tainted\\nwell. They had heard the common country talk, it is true; but could not\\nbelieve that anything contrary to natural law had occurred. No doubt\\nthe meteor had poisoned the soil, but the illness of person and animals\\nwho had eaten nothing grown in that soil was another matter. Was it the\\nwell water? Very possibly. It might be a good idea to analyse it. But\\nwhat peculiar madness could have made both boys jump into the well?\\nTheir deeds were so similarâ\\x80\\x94and the fragments showed that they had\\nboth suffered from the grey brittle death. Why was everything so grey\\nand brittle?\\n\\nIt was the coroner, seated near a window overlooking the yard, who\\nfirst noticed the glow about the well. Night had fully set in, and all\\nthe abhorrent grounds seemed faintly luminous with more than the fitful\\nmoonbeams; but this new glow was something definite and distinct, and\\nappeared to shoot up from the black pit like a softened ray from a\\nsearchlight, giving dull reflections in the little ground pools where\\nthe water had been emptied. It had a very queer colour, and as all the\\nmen clustered round the window Ammi gave a violent start. For this\\nstrange beam of ghastly miasma was to him of no unfamiliar hue. He had\\nseen that colour before, and feared to think what it might mean. He\\nhad seen it in the nasty brittle globule in that aerolite two summers\\nago, had seen it in the crazy vegetation of the springtime, and had\\nthought he had seen it for an instant that very morning against the\\nsmall barred window of that terrible attic room where nameless things\\nhad happened. It had flashed there a second, and a clammy and hateful\\ncurrent of vapour had brushed past himâ\\x80\\x94and then poor Nahum had been\\ntaken by something of that colour. He had said so at the lastâ\\x80\\x94said it\\nwas like the globule and the plants. After that had come the runaway\\nin the yard and the splash in the wellâ\\x80\\x94and now that well was belching\\nforth to the night a pale insidious beam of the same demoniac tint.\\n\\nIt does credit to the alertness of Ammi\\'s mind that he puzzled even\\nat that tense moment over a point which was essentially scientific.\\nHe could not but wonder at his gleaning of the same impression from\\na vapour glimpsed in the daytime, against a window opening in the\\nmorning sky, and from a nocturnal exhalation seen as a phosphorescent\\nmist against the black and blasted landscape. It wasn\\'t rightâ\\x80\\x94it was\\nagainst Natureâ\\x80\\x94and he thought of those terrible last words of his\\nstricken friend, \"It come from some place whar things ain\\'t as they is\\nhere ... one o\\' them professors said so....\"\\n\\nAll three horses outside, tied to a pair of shrivelled saplings by\\nthe road, were now neighing and pawing frantically. The wagon driver\\nstarted for the door to do something, but Ammi laid a shaky hand on his\\nshoulder. \"Dun\\'t go out thar,\" he whispered. \"They\\'s more to this nor\\nwhat we know. Nahum said somethin\\' lived in the well that sucks your\\nlife out. He said it must be some\\'at growed from a round ball like one\\nwe all seen in the meteor stone that fell a year ago June. Sucks an\\'\\nburns, he said, an\\' is jest a cloud of colour like that light out thar\\nnow, that ye can hardly see an\\' can\\'t tell what it is. Nahum thought it\\nfeeds on everything livin\\' an\\' gits stronger all the time. He said he\\nseen it this last week. It must be somethin\\' from away off in the sky\\nlike the men from the college last year says the meteor stone was. The\\nway it\\'s made an\\' the way it works ain\\'t like no way o\\' God\\'s world.\\nIt\\'s some\\'at from beyond.\"\\n\\nSo the men paused indecisively as the light from the well grew stronger\\nand the hitched horses pawed and whinnied in increasing frenzy. It was\\ntruly an awful moment; with terror in that ancient and accursed house\\nitself, four monstrous sets of fragmentsâ\\x80\\x94two from the house and two\\nfrom the wellâ\\x80\\x94in the woodshed behind, and that shaft of unknown and\\nunholy iridescence from the slimy depths in front. Ammi had restrained\\nthe driver on impulse, forgetting how uninjured he himself was after\\nthe clammy brushing of that coloured vapour in the attic room, but\\nperhaps it is just as well that he acted as he did. No one will ever\\nknow what was abroad that night; and though the blasphemy from beyond\\nhad not so far hurt any human of unweakened mind, there is no telling\\nwhat it might not have done at that last moment, and with its seemingly\\nincreased strength and the special signs of purpose it was soon to\\ndisplay beneath the half-clouded moonlit sky.\\n\\nAll at once one of the detectives at the window gave a short, sharp\\ngasp. The others looked at him, and then quickly followed his own\\ngaze upward to the point at which its idle straying had been suddenly\\narrested. There was no need for words. What had been disputed in\\ncountry gossip was disputable no longer, and it is because of the\\nthing which every man of that party agreed in whispering later on,\\nthat strange days are never talked about in Arkham. It is necessary to\\npremise that there was no wind at that hour of the evening. One did\\narise not long afterward, but there was absolutely none then. Even\\nthe dry tips of the lingering hedge-mustard, grey and blighted, and\\nthe fringe on the roof of the standing democrat-wagon were unstirred.\\nAnd yet amid that tense, godless calm the high bare boughs of all\\nthe trees in the yard were moving. They were twitching morbidly and\\nspasmodically, clawing in convulsive and epileptic madness at the\\nmoonlit clouds; scratching impotently in the noxious air as if jerked\\nby some allied and bodiless line of linkage with sub-terrene horrors\\nwrithing and struggling below the black roots.\\n\\nNot a man breathed for several seconds. Then a cloud of darker depth\\npassed over the moon, and the silhouette of clutching branches faded\\nout momentarily. At this there was a general cry; muffled with awe,\\nbut husky and almost identical from every throat. For the terror had\\nnot faded with the silhouette, and in a fearsome instant of deeper\\ndarkness the watchers saw wriggling at the treetop height a thousand\\ntiny points of faint and unhallowed radiance, tipping each bough like\\nthe fire of St. Elmo or the flames that come down on the apostles\\'\\nheads at Pentecost. It was a monstrous constellation of unnatural\\nlight, like a glutted swarm of corpse-fed fireflies dancing hellish\\nsarabands over an accursed marsh; and its colour was that same nameless\\nintrusion which Ammi had come to recognise and dread. All the while\\nthe shaft of phosphorescence from the well was getting brighter and\\nbrighter, bringing to the minds of the huddled men, a sense of doom and\\nabnormality which far outraced any image their conscious minds could\\nform. It was no longer shining out; it was pouring out; and as the\\nshapeless stream of unplaceable colour left the well it seemed to flow\\ndirectly into the sky.\\n\\n... and in the fearsome instant of deeper darkness, the\\nwatchers saw wriggling at that treetop height, a thousand tiny points\\nof faint and unhallowed radiance, tipping each bough like the fire\\nof St. Elmo ... and all the while the shaft of phosphorescence from\\nthe well was getting brighter and brighter and bringing to the minds\\nof the huddled men, a sense of doom and abnormality.... It was no\\nlonger shining out; it was pouring out; and as the shapeless stream of\\nunplaceable colour left the well, it seemed to flow directly into the\\nsky.\\n\\nThe veterinary shivered, and walked to the front door to drop the heavy\\nextra bar across it. Ammi shook no less, and had to tug and point for\\nlack of a controllable voice when he wished to draw notice to the\\ngrowing luminosity of the trees. The neighing and stamping of the\\nhorses had become utterly frightful, but not a soul of that group in\\nthe old house would have ventured forth for any earthly reward. With\\nthe moments the shining of the trees increased, while their restless\\nbranches seemed to strain more and more toward verticality. The wood\\nof the well-sweep was shining now, and presently a policeman dumbly\\npointed to some wooden sheds and beehives near the stone wall on the\\nwest. They were commencing to shine, too, though the tethered vehicles\\nof the visitors seemed so far unaffected. Then there was a wild\\ncommotion and clopping in the road, and as Ammi quenched the lamp for\\nbetter seeing they realized that the span of frantic grays had broken\\ntheir sapling and run off with the democrat-wagon.\\n\\nThe shock served to loosen several tongues, and embarrassed whispers\\nwere exchanged. \"It spreads on everything organic that\\'s been around\\nhere,\" muttered the medical examiner. No one replied, but the man who\\nhad been in the well gave a hint that his long pole must have stirred\\nup something intangible. \"It was awful,\" he added. \"There was no bottom\\nat all. Just ooze and bubbles and the feeling of something lurking\\nunder there.\" Ammi\\'s horse still pawed and screamed deafeningly in\\nthe road outside, and nearly drowned its owner\\'s faint quaver as he\\nmumbled his formless reflections. \"It come from that stoneâ\\x80\\x94it growed\\ndown tharâ\\x80\\x94it got everything livin\\'â\\x80\\x94it fed itself on \\'em, mind and\\nbodyâ\\x80\\x94Thad an\\' Merwin, Zenas an\\' Nabbyâ\\x80\\x94Nahum was the lastâ\\x80\\x94they all\\ndrunk the waterâ\\x80\\x94it got strong on \\'emâ\\x80\\x94it come from beyond, whar things\\nain\\'t like they be hereâ\\x80\\x94now it\\'s goin\\' homeâ\\x80\\x94\"\\n\\nAt this point, as the column of unknown colour flared suddenly stronger\\nand began to weave itself into fantastic suggestions of shape which\\neach spectator later described differently, there came from poor\\ntethered Hero such a sound as no man before or since ever heard from\\na horse. Every person in that low-pitched sitting-room stopped his\\nears, and Ammi turned away from the window in horror and nausea. Words\\ncould not convey itâ\\x80\\x94when Ammi looked out again the hapless beast lay\\nhuddled inert on the moonlit ground between the splintered shafts of\\nthe buggy. That was the last of Hero till they buried him next day.\\nBut the present was no time to mourn, for almost at this instant a\\ndetective silently called attention to something terrible in the very\\nroom with them. In the absence of the lamplight it was clear that a\\nfaint phosphorescence had begun to pervade the entire apartment. It\\nglowed on the broad-planked floor where the rag carpet left it bare,\\nand shimmered over the sashes of the small-paned windows. It ran up\\nand down the exposed corner-posts, coruscated about the shelf and\\nmantel, and infected the very doors and furniture. Each minute saw it\\nstrengthen, and at last it was very plain that healthy living things\\nmust leave that house.\\n\\nAmmi showed them the back door and the path up through the fields to\\nthe ten-acre pasture. They walked and stumbled as in a dream, and did\\nnot dare look back till they were far away on the high ground. They\\nwere glad of the path, for they could not have gone the front way, by\\nthat well. It was bad enough passing the glowing barn and sheds, and\\nthose shining orchard trees with their gnarled, fiendish contours; but\\nthank Heaven the branches did their worst twisting high up. The moon\\nwent under some very black clouds as they crossed the rustic bridge\\nover Chapman\\'s Brook, and it was blind groping from there to the open\\nmeadows.\\n\\nWhen they looked back toward the valley and the distant Gardner place\\nat the bottom they saw a fearsome sight. All the farm was shining\\nwith the hideous unknown blend of colour; trees, buildings, and even\\nsuch grass and herbage as had not been wholly changed to lethal grey\\nbrittleness. The boughs were all straining skyward, tipped with tongues\\nof foul flame, and lambent tricklings of the same monstrous fire were\\ncreeping about the ridgepoles of the house, barn and sheds. It was a\\nscene from a vision of Fuseli, and over all the rest reigned that riot\\nof luminous amorphousness, that alien and undimensioned rainbow of\\ncryptic poison from the wellâ\\x80\\x94seething, feeling, lapping, reaching,\\nscintillating, straining, and malignly bubbling in its cosmic and\\nunrecognizable chromaticism.\\n\\nThen without warning the hideous thing shot vertically up toward the\\nsky like a rocket or meteor, leaving behind no trail and disappearing\\nthrough a round and curiously regular hole in the clouds before any\\nman could gasp or cry out. No watcher can ever forget that sight, and\\nAmmi stared blankly at the stars of Cygnus, Deneb twinkling above the\\nothers, where the unknown colour had melted into the Milky Way. But his\\ngaze was the next moment called swiftly to earth by the crackling in\\nthe valley. It was just that. Only a wooden ripping and crackling, and\\nnot an explosion, as so many others of the party vowed. Yet the outcome\\nwas the same, for in one feverish kaleidoscopic instant there burst up\\nfrom that doomed and accursed farm a gleamingly eruptive cataclysm of\\nunnatural sparks and substance; blurring the glance of the few who saw\\nit, and sending forth to the zenith a bombarding cloudburst of such\\ncoloured and fantastic fragments as our universe must needs disown.\\nThrough quickly re-closing vapours they followed the great morbidity\\nthat had vanished, and in another second they had vanished too. Behind\\nand below was only a darkness to which the men dared not return, and\\nall about was a mounting wind which seemed to sweep down in black,\\nfrore gusts from interstellar space. It shrieked and howled, and lashed\\nthe fields and distorted woods in a mad cosmic frenzy, till soon the\\ntrembling party realized it would be no use waiting for the moon to\\nshow what was left down there at Nahum\\'s.\\n\\nToo awed even to hint theories, the seven shaking men trudged back\\ntoward Arkham by the north road. Ammi was worse than his fellows,\\nand begged them to see him inside his own kitchen, instead of\\nkeeping straight on to town. He did not wish to cross the blighted,\\nwind-whipped woods alone to his home on the main road. For he had had\\nan added shock that the others were spared, and was crushed for ever\\nwith a brooding fear he dared not even mention for many years to come.\\nAs the rest of the watchers on that tempestuous hill had stolidly set\\ntheir faces toward the road, Ammi had looked back an instant at the\\nshadowed valley of desolation so lately sheltering his ill-starred\\nfriend. And from that stricken, far-away spot he had seen something\\nfeebly rise, only to sink down again upon the place from which the\\ngreat shapeless horror had shot into the sky. It was just a colourâ\\x80\\x94but\\nnot any colour of our earth or heavens. And because Ammi recognized\\nthat colour, and knew that this last faint remnant must still lurk down\\nthere in the well, he has never been quite right since.\\n\\nAmmi would never go near the place again. It is forty-four years now\\nsince the horror happened, but he has never been there, and will be\\nglad when the new reservoir blots it out. I shall be glad, too, for I\\ndo not like the way the sunlight changed colour around the mouth of\\nthat abandoned well I passed. I hope the water will always be very\\ndeepâ\\x80\\x94but even so, I shall never drink it. I do not think I shall visit\\nthe Arkham country hereafter. Three of the men who had been with Ammi\\nreturned the next morning to see the ruins by daylight, but there were\\nnot any real ruins. Only the bricks of the chimney, the stones of the\\ncellar, some mineral and metallic litter here and there, and the rim\\nof that nefandous well. Save for Ammi\\'s dead horse, which they towed\\naway and buried, and the buggy which they shortly returned to him,\\neverything that had ever been living had gone. Five eldritch acres of\\ndusty grey desert remained, nor has anything ever grown there since.\\nTo this day it sprawls open to the sky like a great spot eaten by acid\\nin the woods and fields, and the few who have ever dared glimpse it in\\nspite of the rural tales have named it \"the blasted heath.\"\\n\\nThe rural tales are queer. They might be even queerer if city men\\nand college chemists could be interested enough to analyze the water\\nfrom that disused well, or the grey dust that no wind seems ever to\\ndisperse. Botanists, too, ought to study the stunted flora on the\\nborders of that spot, for they might shed light on the country notion\\nthat the blight is spreadingâ\\x80\\x94little by little, perhaps an inch a year.\\nPeople say the colour of the neighboring herbage is not quite right\\nin the spring, and that wild things leave queer prints in the light\\nwinter snow. Snow never seems quite so heavy on the blasted heath as\\nit is elsewhere. Horsesâ\\x80\\x94the few that are left in this motor ageâ\\x80\\x94grow\\nskittish in the silent valley; and hunters cannot depend on their dogs\\ntoo near the splotch of greyish dust.\\n\\nThey say the mental influences are very bad, too; numbers went queer in\\nthe years after Nahum\\'s taking, and always they lacked the power to get\\naway. Then the stronger-minded folk all left the region, and only the\\nforeigners tried to live in the crumbling old homesteads. They could\\nnot stay, though; and one sometimes wonders what insight beyond ours\\ntheir wild, weird stories of whispered magic have given them. Their\\ndreams at night, they protest, are very horrible in that grotesque\\ncountry; and surely the very look of the dark realm is enough to stir\\na morbid fancy. No traveler has ever escaped a sense of strangeness in\\nthose deep ravines, and artists shiver as they paint thick woods whose\\nmystery is as much of the spirits as of the eye. I myself am curious\\nabout the sensation I derived from my one lone walk before Ammi told\\nme his tale. When twilight came I had vaguely wished some clouds would\\ngather, for odd timidity about the deep skyey voids above had crept\\ninto my soul.\\n\\nDo not ask me for my opinion. I do not knowâ\\x80\\x94that is all. There was no\\none but Ammi to question; for Arkham people will not talk about the\\nstrange days, and all three professors who saw the aerolite and its\\ncoloured globule are dead. There were other globulesâ\\x80\\x94depend upon that.\\nOne must have fed itself and escaped, and probably there was another\\nwhich was too late. No doubt it is still down the wellâ\\x80\\x94I know there\\nwas something wrong with the sunlight I saw above that miasmal brink.\\nThe rustics say the blight creeps an inch a year, so perhaps there is\\na kind of growth or nourishment even now. But whatever demon hatchling\\nis there, it must be tethered to something or else it would quickly\\nspread. Is it fastened to the roots of those trees that claw the air?\\nOne of the current Arkham tales is about fat oaks that shine and move\\nas they ought not to do at night.\\n\\nWhat it is, only God knows. In terms of matter I suppose the thing\\nAmmi described would be called a gas, but this gas obeyed laws that\\nare not of our cosmos. This was no fruit of such worlds and suns as\\nshine on the telescopes and photographic plates of our observatories.\\nThis was no breath from the skies whose motions and dimensions our\\nastronomers measure or deem too vast to measure. It was just a colour\\nout of spaceâ\\x80\\x94a frightful messenger from unformed realms of infinity\\nbeyond all Nature as we know it; from realms whose mere existence stuns\\nthe brain and numbs us with the black extra-cosmic gulfs it throws open\\nbefore our frenzied eyes.\\n\\nI doubt very much if Ammi consciously lied to me, and I do not think\\nhis tale was all a freak of madness as the townsfolk had forewarned.\\nSomething terrible came to the hills and valleys on that meteor,\\nand something terribleâ\\x80\\x94though I know not in what proportionâ\\x80\\x94still\\nremains. I shall be glad to see the water come. Meanwhile I hope\\nnothing will happen to Ammi. He saw so much of the thingâ\\x80\\x94and its\\ninfluence was so insidious. Why has he never been able to move away?\\nHow clearly he recalled those dying words of Nahum\\'sâ\\x80\\x94\"can\\'t git\\nawayâ\\x80\\x94draws yeâ\\x80\\x94ye know summ\\'at\\'s comin\\', but \\'tain\\'t no useâ\\x80\\x94\" Ammi is\\nsuch a good old manâ\\x80\\x94when the reservoir gang gets to work I must write\\nthe chief engineer to keep a sharp watch on him. I would hate to think\\nof him as the grey, twisted, brittle monstrosity which persists more\\nand more in troubling my sleep.\\n\\nTHE END',\n",

My coming to New York had been a\\nmistake; for whereas I had looked for poignant wonder and\\ninspiration in the teeming labyrinths of ancient streets that twist\\nendlessly from forgotten courts and squares and waterfronts to\\ncourts and squares and waterfronts equally forgotten, and in the\\nCyclopean modern towers and pinnacles that rise blackly Babylonian\\nunder waning moons, I had found instead only a sense of horror and\\noppression which threatened to master, paralyze, and annihilate me.\\n\\nThe disillusion had been gradual. Coming for the first time upon the\\ntown, I had seen it in the sunset from a bridge, majestic above its\\nwaters, its incredible peaks and pyramids rising flowerlike and\\ndelicate from pools of violet mist to play with the flaming golden\\nclouds and the first stars of evening. Then it had lighted up window\\nby window above the shimmering tides where lanterns nodded and\\nglided and deep horns bayed weird harmonies, and had itself become a\\nstarry firmament of dream, redolent of faery music, and one with the\\nmarvels of Carcassonne and Samarcand and El Dorado and all glorious\\nand half-fabulous cities. Shortly afterward I was taken through\\nthose antique ways so dear to my fancyâ\\x80\\x94narrow, curving alleys and\\npassages where rows of red Georgian brick blinked with small-paned\\ndormers above pillared doorways that had looked on gilded sedans and\\npaneled coachesâ\\x80\\x94and in the first flush of realization of these\\nlong-wished things I thought I had indeed achieved such treasures as\\nwould make me in time a poet.\\n\\nBut success and happiness were not to be. Garish daylight showed\\nonly squalor and alienage and the noxious elephantiasis of climbing,\\nspreading stone where the moon had hinted of loveliness and elder\\nmagic; and the throngs of people that seethed through the flumelike\\nstreets were squat, swarthy strangers with hardened faces and narrow\\neyes, shrewd strangers without dreams and without kinship to the\\nscenes about them, who could never mean aught to a blue-eyed man of\\nthe old folk, with the love of fair green lanes and white New\\nEngland village steeples in his heart.\\n\\nSo instead of the poems I had hoped for, there came only a\\nshuddering blankness and ineffable loneliness; and I saw at last a\\nfearful truth which no one had ever dared to breathe beforeâ\\x80\\x94the\\nunwhisperable secret of secretsâ\\x80\\x94the fact that this city of stone and\\nstridor is not a sentient perpetuation of Old New York as London is\\nof Old London and Paris of Old Paris, but that it is in fact quite\\ndead, its sprawling body imperfectly embalmed and infested with\\nqueer animate things which have nothing to do with it as it was in\\nlife. Upon making this discovery I ceased to sleep comfortably;\\nthough something of resigned tranquillity came back as I gradually\\nformed the habit of keeping off the streets by day and venturing\\nabroad only at night, when darkness calls forth what little of the\\npast still hovers wraithlike about, and old white doorways remember\\nthe stalwart forms that once passed through them. With this mode of\\nrelief I even wrote a few poems, and still refrained from going home\\nto my people lest I seem to crawl back ignobly in defeat.\\n\\nThen, on a sleepless nightâ\\x80\\x99s walk, I met the man. It was in a\\ngrotesque hidden courtyard of the Greenwich section, for there in my\\nignorance I had settled, having heard of the place as the natural\\nhome of poets and artists. The archaic lanes and houses and\\nunexpected bits of square and court had indeed delighted me, and\\nwhen I found the poets and artists to be loud-voiced pretenders\\nwhose quaintness is tinsel and whose lives are a denial of all that\\npure beauty which is poetry and art, I stayed on for love of these\\nvenerable things. I fancied them as they were in their prime, when\\nGreenwich was a placid village not yet engulfed by the town; and in\\nthe hours before dawn, when all the revellers had slunk away, I used\\nto wander alone among their cryptical windings and brood upon the\\ncurious arcana which generations must have deposited there. This\\nkept my soul alive, and gave me a few of those dreams and visions\\nfor which the poet far within me cried out.\\n\\nThe man came upon me at about 2 one cloudy August morning, as I was\\nthreading a series of detached courtyards; now accessible only\\nthrough the unlighted hallways of intervening buildings, but once\\nforming parts of a continuous network of picturesque alleys. I had\\nheard of them by vague rumor, and realized that they could not be\\nupon any map of today; but the fact that they were forgotten only\\nendeared them to me, so that I had sought them with twice my usual\\neagerness. Now that I had found them, my eagerness was again\\nredoubled; for something in their arrangement dimly hinted that they\\nmight be only a few of many such, with dark, dumb counterparts\\nwedged obscurely betwixt high blank walls and deserted rear\\ntenements, or lurking lamplessly behind archways, unbetrayed by\\nhordes of the foreign-speaking or guarded by furtive and\\nuncommunicative artists whose practises do not invite publicity or\\nthe light of day.\\n\\nHe spoke to me without invitation, noting my mood and glances as I\\nstudied certain knockered doorways above iron-railed steps, the\\npallid glow of traceried transoms feebly lighting my face. His own\\nface was in shadow, and he wore a wide-brimmed hat which somehow\\nblended perfectly with the out-of-date cloak he affected; but I was\\nsubtly disquieted even before he addressed me. His form was very\\nslight, thin almost to cadaverousness; and his voice proved\\nphenomenally soft and hollow, though not particularly deep. He had,\\nhe said, noticed me several times at my wanderings; and inferred\\nthat I resembled him in loving the vestiges of former years. Would I\\nnot like the guidance of one long practised in these explorations,\\nand possessed of local information profoundly deeper than any which\\nan obvious newcomer could possibly have gained?\\n\\nAs he spoke, I caught a glimpse of his face in the yellow beam from\\na solitary attic window. It was a noble, even a handsome, elderly\\ncountenance; and bore the marks of a lineage and refinement unusual\\nfor the age and place. Yet some quality about it disturbed me almost\\nas much as its features pleased meâ\\x80\\x94perhaps it was too white, or too\\nexpressionless, or too much out of keeping with the locality, to\\nmake me feel easy or comfortable. Nevertheless I followed him; for\\nin those dreary days my quest for antique beauty and mystery was all\\nthat I had to keep my soul alive, and I reckoned it a rare favor of\\nFate to fall in with one whose kindred seekings seemed to have\\npenetrated so much farther than mine.\\n\\nSomething in the night constrained the cloaked man to silence, and\\nfor a long hour he led me forward without needless words; making\\nonly the briefest of comments concerning ancient names and dates and\\nchanges, and directing my progress very largely by gestures as we\\nsqueezed through interstices, tiptoed through corridors, clambered\\nover brick walls, and once crawled on hands and knees through a low,\\narched passage of stone whose immense length and tortuous twistings\\neffaced at last every hint of geographical location I had managed to\\npreserve. The things we saw were very old and marvelous, or at least\\nthey seemed so in the few straggling rays of light by which I viewed\\nthem, and I shall never forget the tottering Ionic columns and\\nfluted pilasters and urn-headed iron fenceposts and flaring-linteled\\nwindows and decorative fanlights that appeared to grow quainter and\\nstranger the deeper we advanced into this inexhaustible maze of\\nunknown antiquity.\\n\\nWe met no person, and as time passed the lighted windows became\\nfewer and fewer. The streetlights we first encountered had been of\\noil, and of the ancient lozenge pattern. Later I noticed some with\\ncandles; and at last, after traversing a horrible unlighted court\\nwhere my guide had to lead me with his gloved hand through total\\nblackness to a narrow wooden gate in a high wall, we came upon a\\nfragment of alley lit only by lanterns in front of every seventh\\nhouseâ\\x80\\x94unbelievably Colonial tin lanterns with conical tops and holes\\npunched in the sides. This alley led steeply uphillâ\\x80\\x94more steeply\\nthan I had thought possible in this part of New Yorkâ\\x80\\x94and the upper\\nend was blocked squarely by the ivy-clad wall of a private estate,\\nbeyond which I could see a pale cupola, and the tops of trees waving\\nagainst a vague lightness in the sky. In this wall was a small,\\nlow-arched gate of nail-studded black oak, which the man proceeded\\nto unlock with a ponderous key. Leading me within, he steered a\\ncourse in utter blackness over what seemed to be a gravel path, and\\nfinally up a flight of stone steps to the door of the house, which\\nhe unlocked and opened for me.\\n\\nWe entered, and as we did so I grew faint from a reek of infinite\\nmustiness which welled out to meet us, and which must have been the\\nfruit of unwholesome centuries of decay. My host appeared not to\\nnotice this, and in courtesy I kept silent as he piloted me up a\\ncurving stairway, across a hall, and into a room whose door I heard\\nhim lock behind us. Then I saw him pull the curtains of the three\\nsmall-paned windows that barely showed themselves against the\\nlightening sky; after which he crossed to the mantel, struck flint\\nand steel, lighted two candles of a candelabrum of twelve sconces,\\nand made a gesture enjoining soft-toned speech.\\n\\nIn this feeble radiance I saw that we were in a spacious,\\nwell-furnished and paneled library dating from the first quarter of\\nthe Eighteenth Century, with splendid doorway pediments, a\\ndelightful Doric cornice, and a magnificently carved overmantel with\\nscroll-and-urn top. Above the crowded bookshelves at intervals along\\nthe walls were well-wrought family portraits; all tarnished to an\\nenigmatical dimness, and bearing an unmistakable likeness to the man\\nwho now motioned me to a chair beside the graceful Chippendale\\ntable. Before seating himself across the table from me, my host\\npaused for a moment as if in embarrassment; then, tardily removing\\nhis gloves, wide-brimmed hat, and cloak, stood theatrically revealed\\nin full mid-Georgian costume from queued hair and neck ruffles to\\nknee-breeches, silk hose, and the buckled shoes I had not previously\\nnoticed. Now slowly sinking into a lyre-back chair, he commenced to\\neye me intently.\\n\\nWithout his hat he took on an aspect of extreme age which was\\nscarcely visible before, and I wondered if this unperceived mark of\\nsingular longevity were not one of the sources of my original\\ndisquiet. When he spoke at length, his soft, hollow, and carefully\\nmuffled voice not infrequently quavered; and now and then I had\\ngreat difficulty in following him as I listened with a thrill of\\namazement and half-disavowed alarm which grew each instant.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou behold, Sir,â\\x80\\x9d my host began, â\\x80\\x9ca man of very eccentrical habits,\\nfor whose costume no apology need be offered to one with your wit\\nand inclinations. Reflecting upon better times, I have not scrupled\\nto ascertain their ways and adopt their dress and manners; an\\nindulgence which offends none if practised without ostentation. It\\nhath been my good fortune to retain the rural seat of my ancestors,\\nswallowed though it was by two towns, first Greenwich, which built\\nup hither after 1800, then New York, which joined on near 1830.\\nThere were many reasons for the close keeping of this place in my\\nfamily, and I have not been remiss in discharging such obligations.\\nThe squire who succeeded to it in 1768 studied sartain arts and made\\nsartain discoveries, all connected with influences residing in this\\nparticular plot of ground, and eminently desarving of the strongest\\nguarding. Some curious effects of these arts and discoveries I now\\npurpose to show you, under the strictest secrecy; and I believe I\\nmay rely on my judgment of men enough to have no distrust of either\\nyour interest or your fidelity.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe paused, but I could only nod my head. I have said that I was\\nalarmed, yet to my soul nothing was more deadly than the material\\ndaylight world of New York, and whether this man were a harmless\\neccentric or a wielder of dangerous arts I had no choice save to\\nfollow him and slake my sense of wonder on whatever he might have to\\noffer. So I listened.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cToâ\\x80\\x94my ancestor,â\\x80\\x9d he softly continued, â\\x80\\x9cthere appeared to reside\\nsome very remarkable qualities in the will of mankind; qualities\\nhaving a little-suspected dominance not only over the acts of oneâ\\x80\\x99s\\nself and of others, but over every variety of force and substance in\\nNature, and over many elements and dimensions deemed more universal\\nthan Nature herself. May I say that he flouted the sanctity of\\nthings as great as space and time and that he put to strange uses\\nthe rites of sartain half-breed red Indians once encamped upon this\\nhill? These Indians showed choler when the place was built, and were\\nplaguey pestilent in asking to visit the grounds at the full of the\\nmoon. For years they stole over the wall each month when they could,\\nand by stealth performed sartain acts. Then, in â\\x80\\x9968, the new squire\\ncatched them at their doings, and stood still at what he saw.\\nThereafter he bargained with them and exchanged the free access of\\nhis grounds for the exact inwardness of what they did; larning that\\ntheir grandfathers got part of their custom from red ancestors and\\npart from an old Dutchman in the time of the States-General. And pox\\non him, Iâ\\x80\\x99m afeared the squire must have sarved them monstrous bad\\nrumâ\\x80\\x94whether or not by intentâ\\x80\\x94for a week after he larnt the secret he\\nwas the only man living that knew it. You, Sir, are the first\\noutsider to be told there is a secret, and split me if Iâ\\x80\\x99d have\\nrisked tampering that much withâ\\x80\\x94the powersâ\\x80\\x94had ye not been so hot\\nafter bygone things.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI shuddered as the man grew colloquialâ\\x80\\x94and with the familiar speech\\nof another day. He went on.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you must know, Sir, that whatâ\\x80\\x94the squireâ\\x80\\x94got from those mongrel\\nsalvages was but a small part of the larning he came to have. He had\\nnot been at Oxford for nothing, nor talked to no account with an\\nancient chymist and astrologer in Paris. He was, in fine, made\\nsensible that all the world is but the smoke of our intellects; past\\nthe bidding of the vulgar, but by the wise to be puffed out and\\ndrawn in like any cloud of prime Virginia tobacco. What we want, we\\nmay make about us; and what we donâ\\x80\\x99t want, we may sweep away. I\\nwonâ\\x80\\x99t say that all this is wholly true in body, but â\\x80\\x99tis sufficient\\ntrue to furnish a very pretty spectacle now and then. You, I\\nconceive, would be tickled by a better sight of sartain other years\\nthan your fancy affords you; so be pleased to hold back any fright\\nat what I design to show. Come to the window and be quiet.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMy host now took my hand to draw me to one of the two windows on the\\nlong side of the malodorous room, and at the first touch of his\\nungloved fingers I turned cold. His flesh, though dry and firm, was\\nof the quality of ice; and I almost shrank away from his pulling.\\nBut again I thought of the emptiness and horror of reality, and\\nboldly prepared to follow whithersoever I might be led. Once at the\\nwindow, the man drew apart the yellow silk curtains and directed my\\nstare into the blackness outside. For a moment I saw nothing save a\\nmyriad of tiny dancing lights, far, far before me. Then, as if in\\nresponse to an insidious motion of my hostâ\\x80\\x99s hand, a flash of\\nheat-lightning played over the scene, and I looked out upon a sea of\\nluxuriant foliageâ\\x80\\x94foliage unpolluted, and not the sea of roofs to be\\nexpected by any normal mind. On my right the Hudson glittered\\nwickedly, and in the distance ahead I saw the unhealthy shimmer of a\\nvast salt marsh constellated with nervous fireflies. The flash died,\\nand an evil smile illumined the waxy face of the aged necromancer.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat was before my timeâ\\x80\\x94before the new squireâ\\x80\\x99s time. Pray let us\\ntry again.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI was faint, even fainter than the hateful modernity of that\\naccursed city had made me.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood God!â\\x80\\x9d I whispered; â\\x80\\x9ccan you do that for any time ?â\\x80\\x9d And as he\\nnodded, and bared the black stumps of what had once been yellow\\nfangs, I clutched at the curtains to prevent myself from falling.\\nBut he steadied me with that terrible, ice-cold claw, and once more\\nmade his insidious gesture.\\n\\nAgain the lightning flashedâ\\x80\\x94but this time upon a scene not wholly\\nstrange. It was Greenwich, the Greenwich that used to be, with here\\nand there a roof or row of houses as we see it now, yet with lovely\\ngreen lanes and fields and bits of grassy common. The marsh still\\nglittered beyond, but in the farther distance I saw the steeples of\\nwhat was then all of New York; Trinity and St. Paulâ\\x80\\x99s and the Brick\\nChurch dominating their sisters, and a faint haze of wood smoke\\nhovering over the whole. I breathed hard, but not so much from the\\nsight itself as from the possibilities my imagination terrifiedly\\nconjured up.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCan youâ\\x80\\x94dare youâ\\x80\\x94go far ?â\\x80\\x9d I spoke with awe, and I think he shared\\nit for a second, but the evil grin returned.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c Far? What I have seen would blast ye to a mad statue of stone!\\nBack, backâ\\x80\\x94forward, forward â\\x80\\x94look, ye puling lack-wit!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd as he snarled the phrase under his breath he gestured anew;\\nbringing to the sky a flash more blinding than either which had come\\nbefore. For full three seconds I could glimpse that pandemoniac\\nsight, and in those seconds I saw a vista which will ever afterward\\ntorment me in dreams. I saw the heavens verminous with strange\\nflying things, and beneath them a hellish black city of giant stone\\nterraces with impious pyramids flung savagely to the moon, and\\ndevil-lights burning from unnumbered windows. And swarming\\nloathsomely on aerial galleries I saw the yellow, squint-eyed people\\nof that city, robed horribly in orange and red, and dancing insanely\\nto the pounding of fevered kettle-drums, the clatter of obscene\\ncrotala, and the maniacal moaning of muted horns whose ceaseless\\ndirges rose and fell undulantly like the waves of an unhallowed\\nocean of bitumen.\\n\\nI saw this vista, I say, and heard as with the mindâ\\x80\\x99s ear the\\nblasphemous domdaniel of cacophony which companioned it. It was the\\nshrieking fulfilment of all the horror which that corpse-city had\\never stirred in my soul, and forgetting every injunction to silence\\nI screamed and screamed and screamed as my nerves gave way and the\\nwalls quivered about me.\\n\\nThen, as the flash subsided, I saw that my host was trembling too; a\\nlook of shocking fear half-blotting from his face the serpent\\ndistortion of rage which my screams had excited. He tottered,\\nclutched at the curtains as I had done before, and wriggled his head\\nwildly, like a hunted animal. God knows he had cause, for as the\\nechoes of my screaming died away there came another sound so\\nhellishly suggestive that only numbed emotion kept me sane and\\nconscious. It was the steady, stealthy creaking of the stairs beyond\\nthe locked door, as with the ascent of a barefoot or skin-shod\\nhorde; and at last the cautious, purposeful rattling of the brass\\nlatch that glowed in the feeble candlelight. The old man clawed and\\nspat at me through the moldy air, and barked things in his throat as\\nhe swayed with the yellow curtain he clutched.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe full moonâ\\x80\\x94damn yeâ\\x80\\x94yeÂ\\xa0.Â\\xa0.Â\\xa0.Â\\xa0ye\\nyelping dogâ\\x80\\x94ye called â\\x80\\x99em, and\\ntheyâ\\x80\\x99ve come for me! Moccasined feetâ\\x80\\x94dead menâ\\x80\\x94Gad sink ye, ye red\\ndevils, but I poisoned no rum oâ\\x80\\x99 yoursâ\\x80\\x94hanâ\\x80\\x99t I kept your pox-rotted\\nmagic safe?â\\x80\\x94ye swilled yourselves sick, curse ye, and ye must needs\\nblame the squireâ\\x80\\x94let go, you! Unhand that latchâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x99ve naught for ye\\nhereâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAt this point three slow and very deliberate raps shook the panels\\nof the door, and a white foam gathered at the mouth of the frantic\\nmagician. His fright, turning to steely despair, left room for a\\nresurgence of his rage against me; and he staggered a step toward\\nthe table on whose edge I was steadying myself. The curtains, still\\nclutched in his right hand as his left clawed out at me, grew taut\\nand finally crashed down from their lofty fastenings; admitting to\\nthe room a flood of that full moonlight which the brightening of the\\nsky had presaged. In those greenish beams the candles paled, and a\\nnew semblance of decay spread over the musk-reeking room with its\\nwormy paneling, sagging floor, battered mantel, rickety furniture,\\nand ragged draperies. It spread over the old man, too, whether from\\nthe same source or because of his fear and vehemence, and I saw him\\nshrivel and blacken as he lurched near and strove to rend me with\\nvulturine talons. Only his eyes stayed whole, and they glared with a\\npropulsive, dilated incandescence which grew as the face around them\\ncharred and dwindled.\\n\\nThe rapping was now repeated with greater insistence, and this time\\nbore a hint of metal. The black thing facing me had become only a\\nhead with eyes, impotently trying to wriggle across the sinking\\nfloor in my direction, and occasionally emitting feeble little spits\\nof immortal malice. Now swift and splintering blows assailed the\\nsickly panels, and I saw the gleam of a tomahawk as it cleft the\\nrending wood. I did not move, for I could not; but watched dazedly\\nas the door fell in pieces to admit a colossal, shapeless influx of\\ninky substance starred with shining, malevolent eyes. It poured\\nthickly, like a flood of oil bursting a rotten bulkhead, overturned\\na chair as it spread, and finally flowed under the table and across\\nthe room to where the blackened head with the eyes still glared at\\nme. Around that head it closed, totally swallowing it up, and in\\nanother moment it had begun to recede; bearing away its invisible\\nburden without touching me, and flowing again out of that black\\ndoorway and down the unseen stairs, which creaked as before, though\\nin reverse order.\\n\\nThen the floor gave way at last, and I slid gaspingly down into the\\nnighted chamber below, choking with cobwebs and half-swooning with\\nterror. The green moon, shining through broken windows, showed me\\nthe hall door half open; and as I rose from the plaster-strewn floor\\nand twisted myself free from the sagged ceiling, I saw sweep past it\\nan awful torrent of blackness, with scores of baleful eyes glowing\\nin it. It was seeking the door to the cellar, and when it found it,\\nit vanished therein. I now felt the floor of this lower room giving\\nas that of the upper chamber had done, and once a crashing above had\\nbeen followed by the fall past the west window of something which\\nmust have been the cupola. Now liberated for the instant from the\\nwreckage, I rushed through the hall to the front door; and finding\\nmyself unable to open it, seized a chair and broke a window,\\nclimbing frenziedly out upon the unkempt lawn where moonlight danced\\nover yard-high grass and weeds. The wall was high, and all the gates\\nwere locked; but moving a pile of boxes in a corner I managed to\\ngain the top and cling to the great stone urn set there.\\n\\nAbout me in my exhaustion I could see only strange walls and windows\\nand old gambrel roofs. The steep street of my approach was nowhere\\nvisible, and the little I did see succumbed rapidly to a mist that\\nrolled in from the river despite the glaring moonlight. Suddenly the\\nurn to which I clung began to tremble, as if sharing my own lethal\\ndizziness; and in another instant my body was plunging downward to I\\nknew not what fate.\\n\\nThe man who found me said that I must have crawled a long way\\ndespite my broken bones, for a trail of blood stretched off as far\\nas he dared look. The gathering rain soon effaced this link with the\\nscene of my ordeal, and reports could state no more than that I had\\nappeared from a place unknown, at the entrance of a little black\\ncourt off Perry Street.\\n\\nI never sought to return to those tenebrous labyrinths, nor would I\\ndirect any sane man thither if I could. Of who or what that ancient\\ncreature was, I have no idea; but I repeat that the city is dead and\\nfull of unsuspected horrors. Whither he has gone, I do not know;\\nbut I have gone home to the pure New England lanes up which fragrant\\nsea-winds sweep at evening.\\n\\nTranscriberâ\\x80\\x99s Note: This story appeared in\\n  the September 1926 issue of Weird Tales Magazine .',\n",

A Result and a Prologue\\n\\nFrom a private hospital for the insane near Providence, Rhode Island,\\nthere recently disappeared an exceedingly singular person. He bore\\nthe name of Charles Dexter Ward, and was placed under restraint most\\nreluctantly by his grieving father.\\n\\nThe patient seemed oddly older than his twenty-six years would warrant;\\nhis face had taken on a subtle cast which only the very aged usually\\nacquire. While his organic processes showed a certain queerness\\nof proportion which nothing in medical experience can parallel.\\nRespiration and heart action had a baffling lack of symmetry, the voice\\nwas lost, so that no sounds above a whisper were possible, digestion\\nwas incredibly prolonged and minimized. The skin had a morbid chill and\\ndryness, and the cellular structure of the tissue seemed exaggeratedly\\ncoarse and loosely-knit. Even a large olive birthmark on his right hip\\nhad disappeared, whilst there had formed on his chest a very peculiar\\nmole or blackish spot of which no trace existed before.\\n\\nPsychologically, too, Charles Ward was unique. His madness held no\\naffinity to any sort recorded in even the latest and most exhaustive\\nof treatises, and was conjoined to a mental force which would have\\nmade him a genius or a leader had it not been twisted into strange and\\ngrotesque forms.\\n\\nOnly Dr. Willett, who brought Charles Ward into the world and watched\\nhis growth of body and mind ever since, seemed frightened at the\\nthought of his future freedom. He had had a terrible experience and had\\nmade a terrible discovery which he dared not reveal to his skeptical\\ncolleagues. Willett, indeed, presents a minor mystery all his own\\nin his connection with the case. He was the last to see the patient\\nbefore his flight, and emerged from that final conversation in a state\\nof mixed horror and relief which several recalled when Ward\\'s escape\\nbecame known three hours later. That escape itself is one of the\\nunsolved wonders of Dr. Waite\\'s hospital. A window open above a sheer\\ndrop of sixty feet could hardly explain it, yet after that talk with\\nWillett the youth was undeniably gone.\\n\\nHe had found Ward in his room, but shortly after his departure the\\nattendants knocked in vain. When they opened the door the patient was\\nnot there, and all they found was the open window with a chill April\\nbreeze blowing in a cloud of fine bluish-gray dust that almost choked\\nthem. True, the dogs had howled some time before; but that was while\\nWillett was still present, and they had caught nothing and shown\\nno disturbance later on. Ward\\'s father was told at once over the\\ntelephone, but he seemed more saddened than surprised. By the time Dr.\\nWaite called in person, Dr. Willett had been talking with him, and both\\ndisavowed any knowledge or complicity in the escape. Only from certain\\nclosely confidential friends of Willett and the senior Ward have any\\nclues been gained, and even these are too wildly fantastic for general\\ncredence. The one fact which remains is that up to the present time no\\ntrace of the missing madman has been unearthed.\\n\\nCharles Ward was an antiquarian from infancy, no doubt gaining his\\ntaste from the venerable town around him, and from the relics of the\\npast which filled every corner of his parent\\'s old mansion in Prospect\\nStreet on the crest of the hill. With the years his devotion to ancient\\nthings increased; so that history, genealogy, and the study of Colonial\\narchitecture, furniture, and craftsmanship at length crowded everything\\nelse from his sphere of interests. These tastes are important to\\nremember in considering his madness. One would have fancied the patient\\nliterally transferred to a former age through some obscure sort of\\nauto-hypnosis. The odd thing was that Ward seemed no longer interested\\nin the antiquities he knew so well. He had, it appears, lost his regard\\nfor them through sheer familiarity; and all his final efforts were\\nobviously bent toward mastering those common facts of the modern world\\nwhich had been so totally and unmistakably expunged from his brain. His\\nwhole program of reading and conversation was determined by a frantic\\nwish to imbibe such knowledge of his own life and of the ordinary\\npractical and cultural background of the twentieth century as ought to\\nhave been his by virtue of his birth in 1902 and his education in the\\nschools of our own time. Alienists are of the dominant opinion that the\\nescaped patient is \"lying low\" in some humble and unexacting position\\ntill his stock of modern information can be brought up to the normal.\\n\\nThe beginning of Ward\\'s madness is a matter of dispute among alienists.\\nDr. Lyman, the eminent Boston authority, places it in 1919 or 1920,\\nduring the boy\\'s last year at the Moses Brown School, when he suddenly\\nturned from the study of the past to the study of the occult, and\\nrefused to qualify for college on the ground that he had individual\\nresearches of much greater importance to make.\\n\\nIt is, broadly speaking, undeniable that the winter of 1919-20 saw\\na great change in Ward; whereby he abruptly dropped his general\\nantiquarian pursuits and embarked on a desperate delving into occult\\nsubjects both at home and abroad, varied only by this strangely\\npersistent search for his fore-father\\'s grave.\\n\\nFrom this opinion, however, Dr. Willett substantially dissents, basing\\nhis verdict on his close and continuous knowledge of the patient, and\\non certain frightful investigations and discoveries which he made\\ntoward the last.\\n\\nThose investigations and discoveries have left their mark upon him; so\\nthat his voice trembles when he tells them, and his hand trembles when\\nhe tries to write of them.\\n\\nThe true madness, he is certain, came with a later change; after the\\nCurwen portrait and the ancient papers had been unearthed; after a trip\\nto strange foreign places had been made, and some terrible invocations\\nchanted under strange and secret circumstances; after certain answers to these invocations had been plainly indicated, and a frantic letter\\npenned under agonizing and inexplicable conditions; after the wave of\\nvampirism and the ominous Pawtuxet gossip; and after the patient\\'s\\nmemory commenced to exclude contemporary images whilst his voice failed\\nand his physical aspect underwent the subtle modification so many\\nsubsequently noticed.\\n\\nIt was only about this time, Willett points out with much acuteness,\\nthat the nightmare qualities became indubitably linked with Ward, and\\nthe doctor feels shudderingly sure that enough solid evidence exists to\\nsustain the youth\\'s claim regarding his crucial discovery. There were\\nthe mysteries and coincidences of the Orne and Hutchinson letters, and\\nthe problem of the Curwen penmanship and of what the detectives brought\\nto light about Dr. Allen; these things, and the terrible message\\nin mediaeval minuscules found in Willett\\'s pocket when he gained\\nconsciousness after his shocking experience.\\n\\nAnd most conclusive of all, there are the two hideous results which\\nthe doctor obtained from a certain pair of formulae during his final\\ninvestigations; results which virtually proved the authenticity of the\\npapers and of their monstrous implications at the same time that those\\npapers were borne for ever from human knowledge.\\n\\nOne must look back at Charles Ward\\'s earlier life as at something\\nbelonging as much to the past as the antiquities he loved so keenly.\\n\\nHis home was a great Georgian mansion atop the well-nigh precipitous\\nhill that rises just east of the river, and from the rear windows of\\nits rambling wings he could look dizzily out over all the clustered\\nspires, domes, roofs and skyscraper summits of the lower town to the\\npurple hills of the countryside beyond. Here he was born, and from the\\nlovely classic porch of the double-bayed brick faÃ§ade his nurse had\\nfirst wheeled him in his carriage; past the little white farmhouse of\\ntwo hundred years before that the town had long ago overtaken, and on\\ntoward the stately colleges along the shady, sumptuous street, whose\\nold square brick mansions and smaller wooden houses with narrow,\\nheavy-columned Doric porches dreamed solid and exclusive amidst their\\ngenerous yards and gardens.\\n\\nHe had been wheeled, too, along sleepy Congdon Street, one tier lower\\ndown on the steep hill, and with all its eastern houses on high\\nterraces. The small wooden houses averaged a greater age here, for\\nit was up this hill that the growing town had climbed. One of the\\nchild\\'s first memories is of the great westward sea of hazy roofs and\\ndomes and steeples and far hills which he saw one winter afternoon\\nfrom that great railed embankment, all violet and mystic against a\\nfevered, apocalyptic sunset of reds and golds and purples and curious\\ngreens. The vast marble dome of the State House stood out in massive\\nsilhouette, its crowning statue haloed fantastically by a break in one\\nof the tinted stratus clouds that barred the flaming sky.\\n\\nWhen he was larger his famous walks began; first with his impatiently\\ndragged nurse and then alone in dreamy meditation. One may picture him\\nyet as he was in those days; tall, slim, and blond, with studious eyes\\nand a slight stoop, dressed somewhat carelessly, and giving a dominant\\nimpression of harmless awkwardness rather than attractiveness.\\n\\nHe would seek for vivid contrasts; spending half a walk in the\\ncrumbling colonial regions northwest of his home, where the hill drops\\nto the lower eminence of Stampers Hill with its ghetto and Negro\\nquarter clustering round the place where the Boston stagecoach used\\nto start before the Revolution, and the other half in the gracious\\nsoutherly realm about George, Benevolent, Power, and Williams Streets,\\nwhere the old slope holds unchanged the fine estates and bits of walled\\ngarden and steep green lane in which so many fragrant memories linger.\\n\\nDr. Willett is certain that, up to this ill-omened winter of first\\nchange, Charles Ward\\'s antiquarianism was free from every trace of\\nthe morbid. Graveyards held for him no particular attraction beyond\\ntheir quaintness and historic value, and of anything like violence or\\nsavage instinct he was utterly devoid. Then, by insidious degrees,\\nthere appeared to develop a curious sequel to one of his genealogical\\ntriumphs of the year before; when he had discovered among his maternal\\nancestors a certain very long-lived man named Joseph Curwen, who had\\ncome from Salem in March of 1692, and about whom a whispered series of\\nhighly peculiar and disquieting stories clustered.\\n\\nWard\\'s great-great-grandfather Welcome Potter had in 1785 married a\\ncertain \"Ann Tillinghast, daughter to Mrs. Eliza, daughter to Capt.\\nJames Tillinghast,\" of whose paternity the family had preserved no\\ntrace. Late in 1918, whilst examining a volume of original town records\\nin manuscript, the young genealogist encountered an entry describing a\\nlegal change of name, by which in 1772 a Mrs. Eliza Curwen, widow of\\nJoseph Curwen, resumed, along with her seven-year-old daughter Ann,\\nher maiden name of Tillinghast; on the ground \"that her Husband\\'s\\nname was become a public Reproach by Reason of what was knowne after\\nhis Decease; the which confirming antient common Rumour, tho\\' not to\\nbe credited by a loyall Wife till so proven as to be wholely past\\nDoubting.\" This entry came to light upon the accidental separation of\\ntwo leaves which had been carefully pasted together and treated as one\\nby a labored revision of the page numbers.\\n\\nIt was at once clear to Charles Ward that he had indeed discovered a\\nhitherto unknown great-great-great-grandfather. Having discovered his\\nown relationship to this apparently \"hushed-up\" character, he at once\\nproceeded to hunt out as systematically as possible whatever he might\\nfind concerning him. In this excited quest he eventually succeeded\\nbeyond his highest expectations, for old letters, diaries and sheaves\\nof unpublished memoirs in cobwebbed Providence garrets and elsewhere\\nyielded many illuminating passages which their writers had not thought\\nit worth their while to destroy. One important sidelight came from\\na point as remote as New York, where some Rhode Island colonial\\ncorrespondence was stored in the Museum at Fraunces\\' Tavern. The really\\ncrucial thing, though, and what in Dr. Willett\\'s opinion formed the\\ndefinite source of Ward\\'s undoing, was the matter found in August,\\n1919, behind the panelling of the crumbling house in Olney Court. It\\nwas that, beyond a doubt, which opened up those black vistas whose end\\nwas deeper than the pit.\\n\\n2. An Antecedent and a Horror\\n\\nJoseph Curwen, as revealed by the rambling legends embodied in what\\nWard heard and unearthed, was a very astonishing, enigmatic, obscurely\\nhorrible individual. He had fled from Salem to Providenceâ\\x80\\x94that\\nuniversal haven of the odd, the free, and the dissentingâ\\x80\\x94at the\\nbeginning of the great witchcraft panic; being in fear of accusation\\nbecause of his solitary ways and queer chemical or alchemical\\nexperiments. He was a colorless-looking man of about thirty, and was\\nsoon found qualified to become a freeman of Providence; thereafter\\nbuying a home lot just north of Gregory Dexter\\'s at about the foot of\\nOlney Street. His house was built on Stampers Hill west of the Town\\nStreet, in what later became Olney Court; and in 1761 he replaced this\\nwith a larger one, on the same site, which is still standing.\\n\\nNow the first odd thing about Joseph Curwen was that he did not seem\\nto grow much older than he had been on his arrival. He engaged in\\nshipping enterprises, purchased wharfage near Mile-End Cove, helped\\nrebuild the Great Bridge in 1713, and in 1723 was one of the founders\\nof the Congregational Church on the hill; but always did he retain the\\nnondescript aspect of a man not greatly over thirty or thirty-five.\\nAs the decades mounted up, this singular quality began to excite wide\\nnotice; but Curwen always explained it by saying that he came of hardy\\nforefathers, and practiced a simplicity of living which did not wear\\nhim out. How such simplicity could be reconciled with the inexplicable\\ncomings and goings of the secretive merchant, and with the queer\\ngleamings of his windows at all hours of night, was not very clear to\\nthe townsfolk; and they were prone to assign other reasons for his\\ncontinued youth and longevity. It was held, for the most part, that\\nCurwen\\'s incessant mixings and boilings of chemicals had much to do\\nwith his condition. At length, when over fifty years had passed since\\nthe stranger\\'s advent, and without producing more than five years\\'\\napparent change in his face and physique, the people began to whisper\\nmore darkly; and to meet more than halfway that desire for isolation\\nwhich he had always shown.\\n\\nPrivate letters and diaries of the period reveal, too, a multitude\\nof other reasons why Joseph Curwen was marvelled at, feared, and\\nfinally shunned like a plague. His passion for graveyards, in which\\nhe was glimpsed at all hours and under all conditions, was notorious;\\nthough no one had witnessed any deed on his part which could actually\\nbe termed ghoulish. On the Pawtuxet Road he had a farm, at which he\\ngenerally lived during the summer, and to which he would frequently be\\nseen riding at various odd times of the day or night. Here his only\\nvisible servants, farmers, and caretakers were a sullen pair of aged\\nNarragansett Indians; the husband dumb and curiously scarred, and the\\nwife of a very repulsive cast of countenance, probably due to a mixture\\nof Negro blood. In the lean-to of this house was the laboratory where\\nmost of the chemical experiments were conducted. Curious porters\\nand teamers who delivered bottles, bags or boxes at the small rear\\ndoor would exchange accounts of the fantastic flasks, crucibles,\\nalembics, and furnaces they saw in the low-shelved room; and prophesied\\nin whispers that the close-mouthed \"chymist\"â\\x80\\x94by which they meant alchemist â\\x80\\x94would not be long in finding the Philosopher\\'s Stone.\\nThe nearest neighbors to this farmâ\\x80\\x94the Fenners, a quarter of a mile\\nawayâ\\x80\\x94had still queerer things to tell of certain sounds which they\\ninsisted came from the Curwen place in the night. There were cries,\\nthey said, and sustained howlings; and they did not like the large\\nnumber of livestock which thronged the pastures. Then, too, there was\\nsomething very obnoxious about a certain great stone outbuilding with\\nonly high narrow slits for windows.\\n\\nGreat Bridge idlers likewise had much to say of Curwen\\'s town house in\\nOlney Court; not so much the fine new one built in 1761, when the man\\nmust have been nearly a century old, but the first low gambrel-roofed\\none with the windowless attic and shingled sides, whose timbers he took\\nthe peculiar precaution of burning after its demolition. Here there\\nwas less mystery, it is true; but the hours at which lights were seen,\\nthe secretiveness of the two swarthy foreigners who comprised the only\\nmanservants, the hideous indistinct mumbling of the incredibly aged\\nFrench housekeeper, the large amounts of food seen to enter a door\\nwithin which only four persons lived, and the quality of certain\\nvoices often heard in muffled conversation at highly unseasonable\\ntimes, all combined with what was known of the Pawtuxet farm to give\\nthe place a bad name.\\n\\nIn choicer circles, too, the Curwen home was by no means undiscussed;\\nfor as the newcomer had gradually worked into the church and trading\\nlife of the town, he had naturally made acquaintances of the better\\nsort, whose company and conversation he was well fitted by education to\\nenjoy.\\n\\nHis birth was known to be good, since the Curwens or Carwens of Salem\\nneeded no introduction in New England. It developed that Joseph Curwen\\nhad traveled much in very early life, living for a time in England and\\nmaking at least two voyages to the Orient; and his speech, when he\\ndeigned to use it, was that of a learned and cultivated Englishman.\\nThere seemed to lurk in his bearing some cryptic, sardonic arrogance,\\nas if he had come to find all human beings dull through having moved\\namong stranger and more potent entities.\\n\\nIn 1746 Mr. John Merritt, an elderly English gentleman of literary and\\nscientific leanings, came from Newport to the town which was so rapidly\\novertaking it in standing, and built a fine country seat on the Neck in\\nwhat is now the heart of the best residence section where he lived in\\nconsiderable style and comfort. Hearing of Curwen as the owner of the\\nbest library in Providence, Mr. Merritt early paid him a call, and was\\nmore cordially received than most other callers at the house had been.\\nCurwen suggested a visit to the farmhouse and laboratory whither he\\nhad never invited anyone before; and the two drove out at once in Mr.\\nMerritt\\'s coach.\\n\\nMr. Merritt maintained that the titles of the books in the special\\nlibrary of thaumaturgical, alchemical, and theological subjects which\\nCurwen kept in a front room were alone sufficient to inspire him with a\\nlasting loathing. This bizarre collection, besides a host of standard\\nworks which Mr. Merritt was not too alarmed to envy, embraced nearly\\nall the cabalists, demonologists, and magicians known to man; and was a\\ntreasure-house of lore in the doubtful realms of alchemy and astrology.\\nHermes Trismegistus in Mesnard\\'s edition, the Turba Philosophorum ,\\nGeber\\'s Liber Investigationis , and Artephous\\' Key of Wisdom all\\nwere there; with the cabalistic Zohar , Peter Jammy\\'s set of Albertus\\nMagnus, Raymond Lully\\'s Ars Magna et Ultima in Zetzner\\'s edition,\\nRoger Bacon\\'s Thesaurus Chemicus , Fludd\\'s Clavis Alchimiae , and\\nTrithemius\\' De Lapide Philosophico crowding them close. Mediaeval\\nJews and Arabs were represented in profusion, and Mr. Merritt turned\\npale when, upon taking down a fine volume conspicuously labeled as the Qunoon-e-Islam , he found it was in truth the forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Al-hazred, of which he had heard such monstrous\\nthings whispered some years previously after the exposure of nameless\\nrites at the strange little fishing village of Kingsport, in the\\nProvince of the Massachusetts-Bay.\\n\\nBut the worthy gentleman owned himself most impalpably disquieted by a\\nmere minor detail. On the huge mahogany table there lay face downward\\na badly worn copy of Borellus, bearing many cryptical marginalia and\\ninterlineations in Curwen\\'s hand.\\n\\nThe book was open at about its middle, and one paragraph displayed\\nsuch thick and tremulous pen-strokes beneath the lines of mystic\\nblack-letters that the visitor could not resist scanning it through. He\\nrecalled it to the end of his days, writing it down from memory in his\\ndiary and once trying to recite it to his close friend Dr. Checkley,\\ntill he saw how greatly it disturbed that urbane rector. It read:\\n\\nThe essential Saltes of Animals may be so prepared and preserved,\\nthat an ingenious Man may have the whole Ark of Noah in his owne\\nStudie, and raise the fine Shape of an Animal out of its Ashes at his\\nPleasure; and by the lyke Method from the essential Saltes of humane\\nDust, a Philosopher may, without any criminal Necromancy, call up the\\nShape of any dead Ancestour from the Dust whereinto his Bodie has been\\nincinerated.\\n\\nIt was near the docks along the southerly part of the Town Street,\\nhowever, that the worst things were muttered about Joseph Curwen.\\nSailors are superstitious folk; and all made strange furtive signs of\\nprotection when they saw the slim, deceptively young-looking figure\\nwith its yellow hair and slight stoop entering the Curwen warehouse\\nin Doubloon Street or talking with captains and supercargos on the\\nlong quay where the Curwen ships rode restlessly. Curwen\\'s own clerks\\nand captains hated and feared him, and all his sailors were mongrel\\nriff-raff from Martinique, St. Eustatius, Havana, or Port Royal. It\\nwas, in a way, the frequency with which these sailors were replaced,\\nwhich inspired the acutest and most tangible part of the fear in which\\nthe old man was held, and in time it became exceedingly difficult for\\nCurwen to keep his oddly assorted hands.\\n\\nBy 1760 Joseph Curwen was virtually an outcast, suspected of vague\\nhorrors and daemoniac alliances which seemed all the more menacing\\nbecause they could not be named, understood, or even proved to exist.\\n\\nMeanwhile the merchant\\'s worldly affairs were prospering. He had a\\nvirtual monopoly of the town\\'s trade in saltpetre, black pepper, and\\ncinnamon, and easily led any other one shipping establishment save the\\nBrowns in his importation of brassware, indigo, cotton, woollens, salt,\\nrigging, iron, paper and English goods of every kind. Curwen was, in\\nfact, one of the prime exporters of the Colony.\\n\\nThe sight of this strange, pallid man, hardly middle-aged in aspect\\nyet certainly not less than a full century old, seeking at last to\\nemerge from a cloud of fright and detestation too vague to pin down or\\nanalyze, was at once a pathetic, a dramatic, and a contemptible thing.\\nSuch is the power of wealth and of surface gestures, however, that\\nthere came indeed a slight abatement in the visible aversion displayed\\ntoward him; especially after the rapid disappearances of his sailors\\nabruptly ceased. He must likewise have begun to practice an extreme\\ncare and secrecy in his graveyard expeditions, for he was never again\\ncaught at such wanderings; whilst the rumors of uncanny sounds and\\nmaneuvers at his Pawtuxet farm diminished in proportion.\\n\\nBut the effect of all this belated mending was necessarily slight.\\nCurwen continued to be avoided and distrusted, as indeed the one fact\\nof his continued air of youth at a great age would have been enough\\nto warrant; and he could see that in the end his fortunes would be\\nlikely to suffer. So about this time the crafty scholar hit upon a last\\ndesperate expedient to regain his footing in the community. Hitherto\\na complete hermit, he now determined to contract an advantageous\\nmarriage; securing as a bride some lady whose unquestioned position\\nwould make all ostracism of his home impossible. It may be that he also\\nhad deeper reasons for wishing an alliance; reasons so far outside\\nthe known cosmic sphere that only papers found a century and a half\\nafter his death caused anyone to suspect them; but of this nothing\\ncertain can ever be learned. Naturally he was aware of the horror and\\nindignation with which any ordinary courtship of his would be received,\\nhence looked about for some likely candidate upon whose parents he\\nmight exert a suitable pressure. Such candidates, he found, were not\\nat all easy to discover; since he had very particular requirements in\\nthe way of beauty, accomplishments, and social security. At length his\\nsurvey narrowed down to the household of one of his best and oldest\\nship-captains, a widower of high birth and unblemished standing named\\nDutie Tillinghast, whose only daughter Eliza seemed dowered with every\\nconceivable advantage save prospects as an heiress. Captain Tillinghast\\nwas completely under the domination of Curwen; and consented, after\\na terrible interview in his cupolaed house on Power\\'s Lane hill, to\\nsanction the blasphemous alliance.\\n\\nEliza Tillinghast was at that time eighteen years of age, and had been\\nreared as gently as the reduced circumstances of her father permitted.\\nHer arguments with her father concerning the proposed Curwen marriage\\nmust have been painful indeed; but of these we have no record. Certain\\nit is that her engagement to young Ezra Weeden, second mate of the\\nCrawford packet Enterprise , was dutifully broken off, and that her\\nunion with Joseph Curwen took place on the seventh of March, 1763, in\\nthe Baptist church, in the presence of one of the most distinguished\\nassemblages which the town could boast; the ceremony being performed\\nby the youngest Samuel Winson. The Gazette mentioned the event very\\nbriefly, and in most surviving copies the item in question seems to be\\ncut or torn out. Ward found a single intact copy after much search in\\nthe archives of a private collector of note, observing with amusement\\nthe meaningless urbanity of the language:\\n\\nMonday evening last, Mr. Joseph Curwen, of this Town, Merchant,\\nwas married to Miss Eliza Tillinghast, Daughter of Captain Dutie\\nTillinghast, a young Lady who has real Merit, added to a beautiful\\nPerson, to grace the connubial State and perpetuate its Felicity.\\n\\nThe social influence of the Tillinghasts, however, was not to be\\ndenied; and once more Joseph Curwen found his house frequented by\\npersons whom he could never otherwise have induced to cross his\\nthreshold. His acceptance was by no means complete, and his bride was\\nsocially the sufferer through her forced venture; but at all events the\\nwall of utter ostracism was somewhat worn down. In his treatment of\\nhis wife the strange bridegroom astonished both her and the community\\nby displaying an extreme graciousness and consideration. The new house\\nin Olney Court was now wholly free from disturbing manifestations,\\nand although Curwen was much absent at the Pawtuxet farm which his\\nwife never visited, he seemed more like a normal citizen than at any\\nother time in his long years of residence. Only one person remained\\nin open enmity with him, this being the youthful ship\\'s officer\\nwhose engagement to Eliza Tillinghast had been so abruptly broken.\\nEzra Weeden had frankly vowed vengeance; and though of a quiet and\\noriginally mild disposition, was now gaining a hate-bred, dogged\\npurpose which boded no good to the usurping husband.\\n\\nOn the seventh of May, 1765, Curwen\\'s only child Ann was born; and was\\nchristened by the Reverend John Graves of King\\'s Church, of which both\\nhusband and wife had become communicants shortly after their marriage,\\nin order to compromise between their respective Congregational and\\nBaptist affiliations. The record of this birth, as well as that of\\nthe marriage two years before, was stricken from most copies of the\\nchurch and town annals where it ought to appear; and Charles Ward\\nlocated both with the greatest difficulty after his discovery of the\\nwidow\\'s change of name had apprised him of his own relationship, and\\nengendered the feverish interest which culminated in his madness. The\\nbirth entry, indeed, was found very curiously through correspondence\\nwith the heirs of the loyalist Dr. Graves, who had taken with him a\\nduplicate set of records when he left his pastorate at the outbreak\\nof the Revolution. Ward had tried this source because he knew that\\nhis great-great-grandmother, Ann Tillinghast Potter, had been an\\nEpiscopalian.\\n\\nShortly after the birth of his daughter, an event he seemed to welcome\\nwith a fervor greatly out of keeping with his usual coldness, Curwen\\nresolved to sit for a portrait. This he had painted by a very gifted\\nScotsman named Cosmo Alexander, then a resident of Newport, and since\\nfamous as the early teacher of Gilbert Stuart. The likeness was said to\\nhave been executed on a wall-panel of the library of the house in Olney\\nCourt, but neither of the two old diaries mentioning it gave any hint\\nof its ultimate disposition.\\n\\nIn 1766 came the final change in Joseph Curwen. It was very sudden,\\nand gained wide notice amongst the curious townsfolk; for the air of\\nsuspense and expectancy dropped like an old cloak, giving instant place\\nto an ill-concealed exaltation of perfect triumph. It was after this\\ntransition, which appears to have come early in July, that the sinister\\nscholar began to astonish people by his possession of information which\\nonly their long-dead ancestors would seem to be able to impart.\\n\\nBut Curwen\\'s feverish secret activities by no means ceased with this\\nchange. On the contrary, they tended rather to increase; so that more\\nand more of his shipping business was handled by the captains whom\\nhe now bound to him by ties of fear as potent as those of bankruptcy\\nhad been. He altogether abandoned the slave trade, alleging that its\\nprofits were constantly decreasing. Every possible moment was spent\\nat the Pawtuxet farm; though there were rumors now and then of his\\npresence in places which, though not actually near graveyards, were yet\\nso situated in relation to graveyards that thoughtful people wondered\\njust how thorough the old merchant\\'s change of habits really was.\\nEzra Weeden, though his periods of espionage were necessarily brief\\nand intermittent on account of his sea voyaging, had a vindictive\\npersistence which the bulk of the practical townsfolk and farmers\\nlacked; and subjected Curwen\\'s affairs to a scrutiny such as they had\\nnever had before.\\n\\nSmuggling and evasion were the rule in Narragansett Bay, and nocturnal\\nlandings of illicit cargoes were continuous commonplaces. But Weeden,\\nnight after night, following the lighters or small sloops which he saw\\nsteal off from the Curwen warehouses at the Town Street docks, soon\\nfelt assured that it was not merely His Majesty\\'s armed ships which the\\nsinister skulker was anxious to avoid. The lighters were wont to put\\nout from the black silent docks, and they would go down the bay some\\ndistance, perhaps as far as Namquit Point, where they would meet and\\nreceive cargo from strange ships of considerable size and widely varied\\nappearance. Curwen\\'s sailors would then deposit this cargo at the usual\\npoint on the shore, and transport it overland to the farm; locking it\\nin the same cryptical stone building which had formerly received the\\nNegroes. The cargo consisted almost wholly of boxes and cases, of which\\na large proportion were oblong and heavy, and disturbingly suggestive\\nof coffins.\\n\\nWeeden always watched the farm with unremitting assiduity, visiting\\nit each night for long periods, and seldom letting a week go by\\nwithout a sight except when the ground bore a footprint-revealing\\nsnow. Finding his own vigils interrupted by nautical duties, he hired\\na tavern companion named Eleazar Smith to continue the survey during\\nhis absences; and between them the two could have set in motion some\\nextraordinary rumors. That they did not do so was only because they\\nknew the effect of publicity would be to warn their quarry and make\\nfurther progress impossible.\\n\\nIt is gathered that Weeden and Smith became early convinced that a\\ngreat series of tunnels and catacombs, inhabited by a very sizable\\nstaff of persons besides the old Indian and his wife, underlay the\\nfarm. The house was an old peaked relic of the middle seventeenth\\ncentury with enormous stack chimney and diamond-paned lattice windows,\\nthe laboratory being in a lean-to toward the north, where the roof\\ncame nearly to the ground. This building stood clear of any other; yet\\njudging by the different voices heard at odd times within, it must\\nhave been accessible through secret passages beneath. These voices\\nran the gamut betwixt dronings of dull acquiescence and explosions of\\nfrantic pain or fury, rumblings of conversation and whines of entreaty,\\npantings of eagerness and shouts of protest. They appeared to be in\\ndifferent languages, all known to Curwen, whose rasping accents were\\nfrequently distinguishable in reply, reproof, or threatening.\\n\\nWeeden had many verbatim reports of overheard scraps in his notebook,\\nfor English, French, and Spanish, which he knew, were frequently used;\\nbut of these nothing has survived. He did, however, say that besides a\\nfew ghoulish dialogues in which the past affairs of Providence families\\nwere concerned, most of the questions and answers he could understand\\nwere historical or scientific; occasionally pertaining to very remote\\nplaces and ages. Once, for example, an alternately raging and sullen\\nfigure was questioned in French about the Black Prince\\'s massacre at\\nLimoges in 1370, as if there were some hidden reason which he ought to\\nknow. Curwen asked the prisonerâ\\x80\\x94if prisoner it wereâ\\x80\\x94whether the order\\nto slay was given because of the Sign of the Goat found on the altar\\nin the ancient Roman crypt beneath the cathedral, or whether The Dark\\nMan of the Haute Vienne Coven had spoken the Three Words. Failing to\\nobtain replies, the inquisitor had seemingly resorted to extreme means;\\nfor there was a terrific shriek followed by silence and muttering and a\\nbumping sound.\\n\\nNone of these colloquies was ever ocularly witnessed, since the windows\\nwere always heavily draped. Later, no more conversations were ever\\nheard in the house, and Weeden and Smith concluded that Curwen had\\ntransferred his field of action to regions below.\\n\\nThat such regions in truth existed, seemed amply clear from many\\nthings. Faint cries and groans unmistakably came up now and then from\\nwhat appeared to be the solid earth in places far from any structure;\\nwhilst hidden in the bushes along the river-bank in the rear, where the\\nhigh ground sloped steeply down to the valley of the Pawtuxet, there\\nwas found an arched oaken door in a frame of heavy masonry, which was\\nobviously an entrance to caverns within the hill.\\n\\nIt was in January, 1770, whilst Weeden and Smith were still debating\\nvainly on what, if anything, to think or do about the whole bewildering\\nbusiness, that the incident of the Fortaleza occurred. Exasperated\\nby the burning of the revenue sloop Liberty at Newport during the\\nprevious summer, the customs fleet under Admiral Wallace had adopted an\\nincreased vigilance concerning strange vessels; and on this occasion\\nHis Majesty\\'s armed schooner Cygnet , under Captain Charles Leshe,\\ncaptured after a short pursuit one early morning the scow Fortaleza of Barcelona, Spain, under Captain Manuel Arruda, bound according to\\nits log from Grand Cairo, Egypt, to Providence. When searched for\\ncontraband material, this ship revealed the astonishing fact that its\\ncargo consisted exclusively of Egyptian mummies, consigned to \"Sailor\\nA. B. C.,\" who would come to remove his goods in a lighter just off\\nNamquit Point, and whose identity Captain Arruda felt himself in honor\\nbound not to reveal. The Vice-Admiralty Court at Newport, at a loss\\nwhat to do in view of the non-contraband nature of the cargo on the\\none hand and of the unlawful secrecy of the entry on the other hand,\\ncompromised on Collector Robinson\\'s recommendation by freeing the\\nship but forbidding it a port in Rhode Island waters. There were later\\nrumors of its having been seen in Boston Harbor, though it never openly\\nentered the Port of Boston.\\n\\nThis extraordinary incident did not fail of wide remark in Providence\\nand there were not many who doubted the existence of some connection\\nbetween the cargo of mummies and the sinister Joseph Curwen; it did\\nnot take much imagination to link him with a freakish importation\\nwhich could not conceivably have been destined for anyone else in\\nthe town. Weeden and Smith, of course, felt no doubt whatsoever of\\nthe significance of the thing; and indulged in the wildest theories\\nconcerning Curwen and his monstrous labors.\\n\\nThe following spring, like that of the year before, had heavy rains;\\nand the watchers kept careful track of the river-bank behind the Curwen\\nfarm. Large sections were washed away, and a certain number of bones\\ndiscovered; but no glimpse was afforded of any actual subterranean\\nchambers or burrows. Something was rumored, however, at the village\\nof Pawtuxet about a mile below, where the river flows in falls over a\\nrocky terrace to join the placid landlocked cove. The fisherfolk about\\nthe bridge did not like the wild way that one of the things stared as\\nit shot down to the still water below, or the way that another half\\ncried out although its condition had greatly departed from that of\\nobjects which normally cry out.\\n\\nThat rumor sent Smithâ\\x80\\x94for Weeden was just then at seaâ\\x80\\x94in haste to\\nthe river-bank behind the farm; where surely enough there remained the\\nevidences of an extensive cave-in. Smith went to the extent of some\\nexperimental digging, but was deterred by lack of successâ\\x80\\x94or perhaps\\nby fear of possible success. It is interesting to speculate on what the\\npersistent and revengeful Weeden would have done had he been ashore at\\nthe time.\\n\\nBy the autumn of 1770 Weeden decided that the time was ripe to tell\\nothers of his discoveries; for he had a large number of facts to link\\ntogether, and a second eye-witness to refute the possible charge\\nthat jealousy and vindictiveness had spurred his fancy. As his first\\nconfidant he selected Captain James Mathewson of the Enterprise ,\\nwho on the one hand knew him well enough not to doubt his veracity,\\nand on the other hand was sufficiently influential in the town to be\\nheard in turn with respect. The colloquy took place in an upper room\\nof Sabin\\'s Tavern near the docks, with Smith present to corroborate\\nvirtually every statement; and it could be seen that Captain Mathewson\\nwas tremendously impressed. Like nearly everyone else in the town,\\nhe had had black suspicions of his own anent Joseph Curwen; hence it\\nneeded only this confirmation and enlargement of data to convince\\nhim absolutely. At the end of the conference he was very grave, and\\nenjoined strict silence upon the two younger men.\\n\\nThe right persons to tell, he believed, would be Dr. Benjamin West,\\nwhose pamphlet on the late transit of Venus proved him a scholar\\nand keen thinker; Reverend James Manning, President of the College;\\nex-Governor Stephen Hopkins, who had been a member of the Philosophical\\nSociety at Newport, and was a man of very broad perceptions; John\\nCarter, publisher of the Gazette ; all four of the Brown brothers,\\nJohn, Joseph, Nicholas and Moses, who formed the recognized local\\nmagnates; old Dr. Jabez Bowen, whose erudition was considerable, and\\nwho had much first-hand knowledge of Curwen\\'s odd purchases; and\\nCaptain Abraham Whipple, a privateersman of phenomenal boldness and\\nenergy who could be counted on to lead in any active measures needed.\\n\\nThe mission of Captain Mathewson prospered beyond his highest\\nexpectations; for whilst he found one or two of the chosen confidants\\nsomewhat skeptical of the possible ghostly side of Weeden\\'s tale, there\\nwas not one who did not think it necessary to take some sort of secret\\nand coÃ¶rdinated action. Curwen, it was clear, formed a vague potential\\nmenace to the welfare of the town and Colony; and must be eliminated at\\nany cost.\\n\\nLate in December, 1770, a group of eminent townsmen met at the home of\\nStephen Hopkins and debated tentative measures. Weeden\\'s notes, which\\nhe had given to Captain Mathewson, were carefully read; and he and\\nSmith were summoned to give testimony anent details. Something very\\nlike fear seized the whole assemblage before the meeting was over,\\nthough there ran through that fear a grim determination which Captain\\nWhipple\\'s bluff and resonant profanity best expressed. They would not\\nnotify the Governor, because a more than legal course seemed necessary.\\nWith hidden powers of uncertain extent apparently at his disposal,\\nCurwen was not a man who could safely be warned to leave town. He must\\nbe surprised at his Pawtuxet farm by a large raiding party of seasoned\\nprivateersmen and given one decisive chance to explain himself. If\\nhe proved a madman, amusing himself with shrieked and imaginary\\nconversations in different voices, he would be properly confined. If\\nsomething graver appeared, and if the underground horrors indeed turned\\nout to be real, he and all with him must die. It could be done quietly,\\nand even the widow and her father need not be told how it came about.\\n\\nWhile these serious steps were under discussion there occurred in the\\ntown an incident so terrible and inexplicable that for a time little\\nelse was mentioned for miles around. In the middle of a moonlit\\nJanuary night with heavy snow underfoot there resounded over the river\\nand up the hill a shocking series of cries which brought sleepy heads\\nto every window; and people around Weybosset Point saw a great white\\nthing plunging frantically along the badly cleared space in front of\\nthe Turk\\'s Head. There was a baying of dogs in the distance, but this\\nsubsided as soon as the clamor of the awakened town became audible.\\nParties of men with lanterns and muskets hurried out to see what\\nwas happening, but nothing rewarded their search. The next morning,\\nhowever, a giant, muscular body, stark naked, was found on the jams\\nof ice around the southern piers of the Great Bridge, where the Long\\nDock stretched out beside Abbott\\'s distil-house, and the identity of\\nthis object became a theme for endless speculation and whispering. It\\nwas not so much the younger as the older folk who whispered, for only\\nin the patriarchs did that rigid face with horror-bulging eyes strike\\nany chord of memory. They, shaking as they did so, exchanged furtive\\nmurmurs of wonder and fear; for in those stiff, hideous features lay a\\nresemblance so marvelous as to be almost an identityâ\\x80\\x94and that identity\\nwas with a man who had died full fifty years before.\\n\\nEzra Weeden was present at the finding; and remembering the baying\\nof the night before, set out along Weybosset Street and across Muddy\\nDock Bridge whence the sound had come. He had a curious expectancy,\\nand was not surprised when, reaching the edge of the settled district\\nwhere the street merged into the Pawtuxet Road, he came upon some very\\ncurious tracks in the snow. The naked giant had been pursued by dogs\\nand many booted men, and the returning tracks of the hounds and their\\nmasters could be easily traced. They had given up the chase upon coming\\ntoo near the town. Weeden smiled grimly, and as a perfunctory detail\\ntraced the footprints back to their source. It was the Pawtuxet farm\\nof Joseph Curwen, as he well knew it would be; and he would have given\\nmuch had the yard been less confusingly trampled. As it was, he dared\\nnot seem too interested in full daylight. Dr. Bowen, to whom Weeden\\nwent at once with his report, performed an autopsy on the strange\\ncorpse, and discovered peculiarities which baffled him utterly. The\\ndigestive tracts of the huge man seemed never to have been in use,\\nwhilst the whole skin had a coarse, loosely-knit texture impossible to\\naccount for. Impressed by what the old man whispered of this body\\'s\\nlikeness to the long-dead blacksmith Daniel Green, whose great-grandson\\nAaron Hoppin was a supercargo in Curwen\\'s employ, Weeden asked casual\\nquestions till he found where Green was buried. That night a party of\\nten visited the old North Burying Ground opposite Herrenden\\'s Lane and\\nopened a grave. They found it vacant, precisely as they had expected.\\n\\n\"They found the grave vacantâ\\x80\\x94precisely as they had expected.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile arrangements had been made with the post riders to intercept\\nJoseph Curwen\\'s mail, and shortly before the incident of the naked body\\nthere was found a letter from one Jedediah Orne of Salem which made the\\ncoÃ¶perating citizens think deeply. Parts of it, copied and preserved in\\nthe private archives of the Smith family where Charles Ward found it,\\nran as follows:\\n\\nI delight that you continue in ye getting at Olde Matters in your\\nWay, and doe not think better was done at Mr. Hutchinson\\'s in\\nSalem-Village.

You inform me, that no Part must be missing if\\nthe finest Effects are to be had, but you can not but know how hard it\\nis to be sure. It seems a great Hazard and Burthen to take away the\\nwhole Box, and in Town (i. e. St. Peter\\'s, St. Paul\\'s, St. Mary\\'s,\\nor Christ Church) it can scarce be done at all. But I know what\\nImperfections were in the one rais\\'d up October last, and how many\\nlive Specimens you were forced to imploy before you hit upon the right\\nMode in the year 1766; so will be guided by you in all Matters. I am\\nimpatient for yr Brig, and inquire daily at Mr. Biddle\\'s Wharf.\\n\\nA third suspicious letter was in an unknown tongue and even an\\nunknown alphabet. In the Smith diary found by Charles Ward a single\\noft-repeated combination of characters is clumsily copied; and\\nauthorities at Brown University have pronounced the alphabet Amharic\\nor Abyssinian, although they do not recognize the word. None of these\\nepistles was ever delivered to Curwen, though the disappearance of\\nJedediah Orne from Salem as recorded shortly afterward showed that the\\nProvidence men took certain quiet steps.\\n\\nCurwen, despite all precautions, apparently felt that something was in\\nthe wind; for he was now remarked to wear an unusually worried look.\\nHis coach was seen at all hours in the town and on the Pawtuxet Road,\\nand he dropped little by little the air of forced geniality with which\\nhe had latterly sought to combat the town\\'s prejudice. The nearest\\nneighbors to his farm, the Fenners, one night remarked a great shaft\\nof light shooting into the sky from some aperture in the roof of that\\ncryptical stone building with the high excessively narrow windows; an\\nevent which they quickly communicated to John Brown in Providence.\\n\\nMr. Brown had become the executive leader of the select group bent\\non Curwen\\'s extirpation, and had informed the Fenners that some\\naction was about to be taken. To them Mr. Brown had entrusted the duty\\nof watching the Curwen farmhouse, and of regularly reporting every\\nincident which took place there.\\n\\nThe probability that Curwen was on guard and attempting unusual things,\\nas suggested by the odd shaft of light, precipitated at last the action\\nso carefully devised by the band of serious citizens. According to the\\nSmith diary a company of about one hundred men met at ten P.M.\\non Friday, April twelfth, 1771, in the great room of Thurston\\'s Tavern\\nat the Sign of the Golden Lion on Weybosset Point across the Bridge.\\nOf the guiding group of prominent men in addition to the leader,\\nJohn Brown, there were present Dr. Bowen, with his case of surgical\\ninstruments, President Manning without the great periwig (the largest\\nin the Colonies) for which he was noted, Governor Hopkins, wrapped in\\na dark cloak and accompanied by his seafaring brother Eseh whom he had\\ninitiated at the last moment with the permission of the rest, John\\nCarter, Captain Mathewson, and Captain Whipple, who was to lead the\\nactual raiding party. These chiefs conferred apart in a rear chamber,\\nafter which Captain Whipple emerged to the great room and gave the\\ngathered seamen their last oaths and instructions. Eleazar Smith was\\nwith the leaders as they sat in the rear apartment awaiting the arrival\\nof Ezra Weeden, whose duty was to keep track of Curwen and report the\\ndeparture of his coach for the farm.\\n\\nAbout ten-thirty a heavy rumble was heard on the Great Bridge, followed\\nby the sound of a coach in the street outside; and at that hour there\\nwas no need of waiting for Weeden in order to know that the doomed\\nman had set out for his last night of unhallowed wizardry. A moment\\nlater, as the receding coach clattered faintly over the Muddy Dock\\nBridge, Weeden appeared; and the raiders fell silently into military\\norder in the street, shouldering the firelocks, fowling-pieces, or\\nwhaling harpoons which they had with them. Weeden and Smith were with\\nthe party, and of the deliberating citizens there were present for\\nactive service Captain Whipple, the leader, Captain Eseh Hopkins, John\\nCarter, President Manning, Captain Mathewson, and Dr. Bowen; together\\nwith Moses Brown, who had come up at the eleventh hour though absent\\nfrom the preliminary session in the tavern. All these freemen and their\\nhundred sailors began the long march without delay, grim and a trifle\\napprehensive as they left the Muddy Dock behind and mounted the gentle\\nrise of Broad Street toward the Pawtuxet Road.\\n\\nAn hour and a quarter later the raiders arrived, as previously agreed,\\nat the Fenner farmhouse; where they heard a final report on their\\nintended victim. He had reached his farm more than half an hour before,\\nand the strange light had soon afterward shot once into the sky. There\\nwere no lights in any visible windows, but this was always the case of\\nlate. Even as this news was given another great glare arose toward the\\nsouth, and the party realized that they had indeed come close to the\\nscene of awesome and unnatural wonders. Captain Whipple now ordered his\\nforce to separate into three divisions; one of twenty men under Eleazar\\nSmith to strike across to the shore and guard the landing-place against\\npossible reinforcements for Curwen until summoned by a messenger for\\ndesperate service; a second of twenty men under Captain Eseh Hopkins to\\nsteal down into the river valley behind the Curwen farm and demolish\\nwith axes or gunpowder the oaken door in the high, steep bank; and\\nthe third to close in on the house and adjacent buildings themselves.\\nOf this last division one third was to be led by Captain Mathewson to\\nthe cryptical stone edifice with high narrow windows, another third to\\nfollow Captain Whipple himself to the main farmhouse, and the remaining\\nthird to preserve a circle around the whole group of buildings until\\nsummoned by a final emergency signal.\\n\\nThe river party would break down the hillside door at the sound of a\\nsingle whistle-blast, waiting and capturing anything which might issue\\nfrom the regions within. At the sound of two whistle blasts it would\\nadvance through the aperture to oppose the enemy or join the rest of\\nthe raiding contingent. The party at the stone building would accept\\nthese respective signals in an analogous manner; forcing an entrance\\nat the first, and at the second descending whatever passage into the\\nground might be discovered, and joining the general or focal warfare\\nexpected to take place within the caverns. A third or emergency signal\\nof three blasts would summon the immediate reserve from its general\\nguard duty; its twenty men dividing equally and entering the unknown\\ndepths through both farmhouse and stone building. Captain Whipple\\'s\\nbelief in the existence of catacombs was absolute, and he took no\\nalternative into consideration when making his plans. He had with him\\na whistle of great power and shrillness and did not fear any mistaking\\nor misunderstanding of signals. The final reserve at the landing, of\\ncourse, was nearly out of the whistle\\'s range; hence, would require a\\nspecial messenger if needed for help. Moses Brown and John Carter went\\nwith Captain Hopkins to the river-bank, while President Manning was\\ndetailed with Captain Mathewson to the stone building. Dr. Bowen, with\\nEzra Weeden, remained in Captain Whipple\\'s party which was to storm the\\nfarmhouse itself. The attack was to begin as soon as a messenger from\\nCaptain Hopkins had joined Captain Whipple to notify him of the river\\nparty\\'s readiness. The leader would then deliver the loud single blast,\\nand the various advance parties would commence their simultaneous\\nattack on three points. Shortly before one A.M. the three\\ndivisions left the Fenner farmhouse; one to guard the landing, another\\nto seek the river valley and the hillside door, and the third to\\nsubdivide and attend to the actual buildings of the Curwen farm.\\n\\nEleazar Smith, who accompanied the shore-guarding party, records in\\nhis diary an uneventful march and a long wait on the bluff by the\\nbay; broken once by what seemed to be the distant sound of the signal\\nwhistle and again by a peculiar muffled blend of roaring and crying\\nand a powder blast which seemed to come from the same direction. Later\\non one man thought he caught some distant gunshots, and still later\\nSmith himself felt the throb of titanic thunderous words resounding\\nin upper air. It was just before dawn that a single haggard messenger\\nwith wild eyes and a hideous unknown odor about his clothing appeared\\nand told the detachment to disperse quietly to their homes and never\\nagain think or speak of the night\\'s doings or of him who had been\\nJoseph Curwen. Something about the bearing of the messenger carried\\na conviction which his mere words could never have conveyed; for\\nthough he was a seaman well known to many of them, there was something\\nobscurely lost or gained in his soul which set him for evermore apart.\\nIt was the same later on when they met other old companions who\\nhad gone into that zone of horror. Most of them had lost or gained\\nsomething imponderable and indescribable. They had seen or heard or\\nfelt something which was not for human creatures, and could not forget\\nit. From them there was never any gossip, for to even the commonest of\\nmortal instincts there are terrible boundaries. And from that single\\nmessenger the party at the shore caught a nameless awe which almost\\nsealed their own lips. Very few are the rumors which ever came from any\\nof them, and Eleazar Smith\\'s diary is the only written record which has\\nsurvived from that whole expedition which set forth from the Sign of\\nthe Golden Lion under the Stars.\\n\\nCharles Ward, however, discovered another vague sidelight in some\\nFenner correspondence which he found in New London, where he knew\\nanother branch of the family had lived. It seems that the Fenners,\\nfrom whose house the doomed farm was distantly visible, had watched\\nthe departing columns of raiders; and had heard very clearly the\\nangry barking of the Curwen dogs, followed by the first shrill blast\\nwhich precipitated the attack. This blast had been followed by a\\nrepetition of the great shaft of light from the stone building, and in\\nanother moment, after a quick sounding of the second signal ordering a\\ngeneral invasion, there had come a subdued rattle of musketry followed\\nby a horrible roaring cry which the correspondent Luke Fenner had\\nrepresented in his epistle by the characters \"Waaaahrrrrrâ\\x80\\x94R\\'waaahrrr.\"\\nThis cry, however, had possessed a quality which no mere writing\\ncould convey, and the correspondent mentions that his mother fainted\\ncompletely at the sound. It was later repeated less loudly, and\\nfurther but more muffled evidences of gunfire ensued; together with\\na loud explosion of powder from the direction of the river. About an\\nhour afterward all the dogs began to bay frightfully, and there were\\nvague ground rumblings so marked that the candlesticks tottered on the\\nmantelpiece. A strong smell of sulphur was noted; and Luke Fenner\\'s\\nfather declared that he heard the third or emergency whistle signal,\\nthough the others failed to detect it. Muffled musketry sounded again,\\nfollowed by a deep scream less piercing but even more horrible than\\nthose which had preceded it; a kind of throaty, nastily plastic cough\\nor gurgle whose quality as a scream must have come more from its\\ncontinuity and psychological import than from its actual acoustic value.\\n\\nThen the flaming thing burst into sight at a point where the Curwen\\nfarm ought to lie, and the human cries of desperate and frightened men\\nwere heard. Muskets flashed and cracked, and the flaming thing fell\\nto the ground. A second flaming thing appeared, and a shriek of human\\norigin was plainly distinguished. Fenner wrote that he could even\\ngather a few words belched in frenzy: \"Almighty, protect thy lamb!\"\\nThen there were more shots, and the second flaming thing fell. After\\nthat came silence for about three-quarters of an hour; at the end of\\nwhich time little Arthur Fenner, Luke\\'s brother, exclaimed that he\\nsaw \"a red fog\" going up to the stars from the accursed farm in the\\ndistance. No one but the child can testify to this, but Luke admits\\nthe significant coincidence implied by the panic of almost convulsive\\nfright which at the same moment arched the backs and stiffened the fur\\nof the three cats then within the room.\\n\\nFive minutes later a chill wind blew up, and the air became suffused\\nwith such an intolerable stench that only the strong freshness of the\\nsea could have prevented its being noticed by the shore party or by\\nany wakeful souls in Pawtuxet village. This stench was nothing which\\nany of the Fenners had ever encountered before, and produced a kind of\\nclutching, amorphous fear beyond that of the tomb or the charnel-house.\\nClose upon it came the awful voice which no hapless hearer will ever be\\nable to forget. It thundered out of the sky like a doom, and windows\\nrattled as its echoes died away. It was deep and musical; powerful as\\na bass organ, but evil as the forbidden books of the Arabs. What it\\nsaid no man can tell, for it spoke in an unknown tongue, but this is\\nthe writing Luke Fenner set down to portray the daemoniac intonations:\\n\"DEESMEESâ\\x80\\x94JESHETâ\\x80\\x94BONEDOSEFEDUVEMAâ\\x80\\x94ENITEMOSS.\" Not till the year 1919\\ndid any soul link this crude transcript with anything else in mortal\\nknowledge, but Charles Ward paled as he recognized what Mirandola\\nhad denounced in shudders as the ultimate horror among black magic\\'s\\nincantations.\\n\\nAn unmistakably human shout or deep chorused scream seemed to answer\\nthis malign wonder from the Curwen farm, after which the unknown\\nstench grew complex with an added odor equally intolerable. A wailing\\ndistinctly different from the scream now burst out and was protracted\\nululantly in rising and falling paroxysms. At times it became almost\\narticulate, though no auditor could trace any definite words; and\\nat one point it seemed to verge toward the confines of diabolic and\\nhysterical laughter. Then a yell of utter, ultimate fright and stark\\nmadness wrenched from scores of human throats; a yell which came strong\\nand clear despite the depth from which it must have burst; after which\\ndarkness and silence ruled all things. Spirals of acrid smoke ascended\\nto blot out the stars, though no flames appeared, and no buildings were\\nobserved to be gone or injured on the following day.\\n\\nToward dawn two frightened messengers with monstrous and unplaceable\\nodor saturating their clothing knocked at the Fenner door and requested\\na keg of rum for which they paid very well indeed. One of them told\\nthe family that the affair of Joseph Curwen was over, and that the\\nevents of the night were not to be mentioned again. Arrogant as the\\norder seemed, the aspect of him who gave it took away all resentment\\nand lent it a fearsome authority; so that only these furtive letters\\nof Luke Fenner, which he urged his Connecticut relative to destroy,\\nremain to tell what was seen and heard. The non-compliance of that\\nrelative, whereby the letters were saved after all, has alone kept\\nthe matter from a merciful oblivion. Charles Ward had one detail to\\nadd as a result of a long canvass of Pawtuxet residents for ancestral\\ntraditions. Old Charles Slocum of that village said that there was\\nknown to his grandfather a queer rumor concerning a charred, distorted\\nbody found in the fields a week after the death of Joseph Curwen was\\nannounced. What kept the talk alive was the notion that this body, so\\nfar as could be seen in its burnt and twisted condition, was neither\\nthoroughly human nor wholly allied to any animal which Pawtuxet folk\\nhad ever seen or read about.\\n\\nNot one man who participated in that terrible raid could ever be\\ninduced to say a word concerning it, and every fragment of the vague\\ndata which survives comes from those outside the final fighting party.\\nThere is something frightful in the care with which these actual\\nraiders destroyed each scrap which bore the least allusion to the\\nmatter.\\n\\nEight sailors had been killed, but although their bodies were not\\nproduced their families were satisfied with the statement that a clash\\nwith customs officers had occurred. The same statement also covered\\nthe numerous cases of wounds, all of which were extensively bandaged\\nand treated only by Dr. Jabez Bowen, who had accompanied the party.\\nHardest to explain was the nameless odor clinging to all the raiders,\\na thing which was discussed for weeks. Of the citizen leaders, Captain\\nWhipple and Moses Brown were most severely hurt, and letters of their\\nwives testify the bewilderment which their reticence and close guarding\\nof their bandages produced. Psychologically every participant was\\naged, sobered, and shaken. It is fortunate that they were all strong\\nmen of action and simple, orthodox religionists, for with more subtle\\nintrospectiveness and mental complexity they would have fared ill\\nindeed. President Manning was the most disturbed; but even he outgrew\\nthe darkest shadow, and smothered memories in prayers. Every man of\\nthose leaders had a stirring part to play in later years, and it is\\nperhaps fortunate that this is so. Little more than a twelve-month\\nafterward Captain Whipple led the mob who burnt the revenue ship Gaspee , and in this bold act we may trace one step in the blotting\\nout of unwholesome images.\\n\\nThere was delivered to the widow of Joseph Curwen a sealed leaden\\ncoffin of curious design, obviously found ready on the spot when\\nneeded, in which she was told her husband\\'s body lay. He had, it was\\nexplained, been killed in a customs battle about which it was not\\npolitic to give details. More than this no tongue ever uttered of\\nJoseph Curwen\\'s end, and Charles Ward had only a single hint wherewith\\nto construct a theory. This hint was the merest threadâ\\x80\\x94a shaky\\nunderscoring of a passage in Jedediah Orne\\'s confiscated letter to\\nCurwen, partly copied in Ezra Weeden\\'s handwriting. The copy was found\\nin the possession of Smith\\'s descendants; and we are left to decide\\nwhether Weeden gave it to his companion after the end, as a mute clue\\nto the abnormality which had occurred, or whether, as is more probable,\\nSmith had it before, and added the underscoring himself from what he\\nhad managed to extract from his friend by shrewd guessing and adroit\\ncross-questioning. The underlined passage is merely this:\\n\\nI say to you againe, doe not call up Any that you cannot put downe;\\nby the which I meane, Any that can in turn calle up somewhat against\\nyou, whereby your powerfullest Devices may not be of use. Ask of the\\nLesser, lest the Greater shall not wish to Answer, and shall commande\\nmore than you.\\n\\nIn the light of this passage, and reflecting on what last unmentionable\\nallies a beaten man might try to summon in his direst extremity,\\nCharles Ward may well have wondered whether any citizen of Providence\\nkilled Joseph Curwen.\\n\\nThe deliberate effacement of every memory of the dead man from\\nProvidence life and annals was vastly aided by the influence of the\\nraiding leaders. They had not at first meant to be so thorough, and\\nhad allowed the widow and her father and child to remain in ignorance\\nof the true conditions; but Captain Tillinghast was an astute man,\\nand soon uncovered enough rumors to whet his horror and cause him to\\ndemand that his daughter and grand-daughter change their name, burn the\\nlibrary and all remaining papers, and chisel the inscription from the\\nslate slab above Joseph Curwen\\'s grave. He knew Captain Whipple well,\\nand probably extracted more hints from that bluff mariner than anyone\\nelse ever gained respecting the end of the accursed sorcerer.\\n\\nFrom that time on the obliteration of Curwen\\'s memory became\\nincreasingly rigid, extending at last by common consent even to the\\ntown records and files of the Gazette . It can be compared in spirit\\nonly to the hush that lay on Oscar Wilde\\'s name for a decade after his\\ndisgrace, and in extent only to the fate of that sinful King of Runagur\\nin Lord Dunsany\\'s tale, whom the gods decided must not only cease to\\nbe, but must cease ever to have been.\\n\\nMrs. Tillinghast, as the widow became known after 1772, sold the\\nhouse in Olney Court and resided with her father in Power\\'s Lane till\\nher death in 1817. The farm at Pawtuxet, shunned by every living\\nsoul, remained to molder through the years; and seemed to decay with\\nunaccountable rapidity. By 1780 only the stone and brickwork were\\nstanding, and by 1800 even these had fallen to shapeless heaps. None\\nventured to pierce the tangled shrubbery on the river-bank behind which\\nthe hillside door may have lain, nor did any try to frame a definite\\nimage of the scenes amidst which Joseph Curwen departed from the\\nhorrors he had wrought.\\n\\nOnly robust old Captain Whipple was heard by alert listeners to mutter\\nonce in awhile to himself, \"Pox on that â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94, but he had no business to\\nlaugh while he screamed. \\'Twas as though the damn\\'d â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94 had some \\'at\\nup his sleeve. For half a crown I\\'d burn his â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94 house.\"\\n\\n3. A Search and an Evocation\\n\\nCharles Ward, as we have seen, first learned in 1918 of his descent\\nfrom Joseph Curwen. That he at once took an intense interest in\\neverything pertaining to the bygone mystery is not to be wondered at;\\nfor every vague rumor that he had heard of Curwen now became something\\nvital to himself, in whom flowed Curwen\\'s blood.\\n\\nIn his first delvings there was not the slightest attempt at\\nsecrecy; he talked freely with his familyâ\\x80\\x94though his mother was not\\nparticularly pleased to own an ancestor like Curwenâ\\x80\\x94and with the\\nofficials of the various museums and libraries he visited. In applying\\nto private families for records thought to be in their possession\\nhe made no concealment of his object, and shared the somewhat\\namused skepticism with which the accounts of the old diarists and\\nletter-writers were regarded.\\n\\nWhen he came across the Smith diary and archives and encountered\\nthe letter from Jedediah Orne he decided to visit Salem and look\\nup Curwen\\'s early activities and connections there, which he did\\nduring the Easter vacation of 1919. At the Essex Institute, which\\nwas well known to him from former sojourns in the glamorous old town\\nof crumbling Puritan gables and clustered gambrel roofs, he was very\\nkindly received, and unearthed there a considerable amount of Curwen\\ndata. He found that his ancestor was born in Salem-Village, now\\nDanvers, seven miles from town, on the eighteenth of February (O. S.)\\n1662-3; and that he had run away to sea at the age of fifteen, not\\nappearing again for nine years, when he returned with the speech,\\ndress, and manners of a native Englishman and settled in Salem proper.\\nAt that time he had little to do with his family, but spent most of\\nhis hours with the curious books he had brought from Europe, and the\\nstrange chemicals which came for him on ships from England, France,\\nand Holland. Certain trips of his into the country were the objects of\\nmuch local inquisitiveness, and were whisperingly associated with vague\\nrumors of fires on the hills at night.\\n\\nCurwen\\'s only close friends had been one Edward Hutchinson of\\nSalem-Village and one Simon Orne of Salem. Hutchinson had a house well\\nout toward the woods, and it was not altogether liked by sensitive\\npeople because of the sounds heard there at night. He was said to\\nentertain strange visitors, and the lights seen from his windows were\\nnot always of the same color. The knowledge he displayed concerning\\nlong-dead persons and long-forgotten events was considered distinctly\\nunwholesome, and he disappeared about the time the witchcraft panic\\nbegan, never to be heard from again. At that time Joseph Curwen also\\ndeparted, but his settlement in Providence was soon learned of. Simon\\nOrne lived in Salem until 1720, when his failure to grow visibly old\\nbegan to excite attention. He thereafter disappeared, though thirty\\nyears later his precise counterpart and self-styled son turned up to\\nclaim his property. The claim was allowed on the strength of documents\\nin Simon Orne\\'s known hand, and Jedediah Orne continued to dwell in\\nSalem till 1771, when certain letters from Providence citizens to the\\nReverend Thomas Barnard and others brought about his quiet removal to\\nparts unknown.\\n\\nCertain documents by and about all of these strange matters were\\navailable at the Essex Institute, the Court House, and the Registry\\nof Deeds, and included both harmless commonplaces such as land titles\\nand bills of sale, and furtive fragments of a more provocative\\nnature. There were four or five unmistakable allusions to them on\\nthe witchcraft trial records; as when one Hepzibah Lawson swore on\\nJuly sixteenth, 1692, at the Court of Oyer and Terminen under Judge\\nHathorne, that \"fortie Witches and the Blacke Man were wont to meete\\nin the Woodes behind Mr. Hutchinson\\'s house,\" and one Amity How\\ndeclared at a session of August eighth before Judge Gedney that \"Mr.\\nG. B. (George Burroughs) on that Nighte put the Divell his Marke upon\\nBridget S., Jonathan A., Simon O. , Deliverance W., Joseph C. ,\\nSusan P., Mehitable C., and Deborah B.\" Then there was a catalogue of\\nHutchinson\\'s uncanny library as found after his disappearance, and an\\nunfinished manuscript in his handwriting, couched in a cipher none\\ncould read. Ward had a photostatic copy of this manuscript made, and\\nbegan to work casually on the cipher as soon as it was delivered to\\nhim. After the following August his labors on the cipher became intense\\nand feverish, and there is reason to believe from his speech and\\nconduct that he hit upon the key before October or November. He never\\nstated, though, whether or not he had succeeded.\\n\\nBut of greatest immediate interest was the Orne material. It took\\nWard only a short time to prove from identity of penmanship a thing\\nhe had already considered established from the text of the letter to\\nCurwen; namely, that Simon Orne and his supposed son were one and the\\nsame person. As Orne had said to his correspondent, it was hardly\\nsafe to live too long in Salem, hence he resorted to a thirty-year\\nsojourn abroad, and did not return to claim his lands except as a\\nrepresentative of a new generation. Orne had apparently been careful to\\ndestroy most of his correspondence, but the citizens who took action\\nin 1771 found and preserved a few letters and papers which excited\\ntheir wonder. There were cryptic formulae and diagrams in his and other\\nhands which Ward now either copied with care or had photographed, and\\none extremely mysterious letter in a chirography that the searcher\\nrecognized from items in the Registry of Deeds as positively Joseph\\nCurwen\\'s.\\n\\nProvidence, 1 May\\n\\nBrother:\\n\\nMy honour\\'d Antient friend, due Respects and earnest Wishes to Him\\nwhom we serve for yr Eternall Power.

The place was indeed only a few\\nsquares from his own home on the great hill\\'s higher ground, and was\\nnow the abode of a Negro family much esteemed for occasional washing,\\nhousecleaning, and furnace-tending services. To find, in distant Salem,\\nsuch sudden proof of the significance of this familiar rookery in his\\nown family history, was a highly impressive thing to Ward; and he\\nresolved to explore the place immediately upon his return.\\n\\nThe more mystical phases of the letter, which he took to be some\\nextravagant kind of symbolism, frankly baffled him; though he noted\\nwith a thrill of curiosity that the Biblical passage referred toâ\\x80\\x94Job\\n14, 14â\\x80\\x94was the familiar verse, \"If a man die, shall he live again? All\\nthe days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.\"\\n\\nYoung Ward came home in a state of pleasant excitement, and spent\\nthe following Saturday in a long and exhaustive study of the house\\nin Olney Court. The place, now crumbling with age, had never been a\\nmansion; but was a modest two-and-a-half story wooden town house of\\nthe familiar Providence Colonial type, with plain peaked roof, large\\ncentral chimney, and artistically carved doorway with rayed fan-light,\\ntriangular pediment, and trim Doric pilasters. It had suffered but\\nlittle alteration externally, and Ward felt he was gazing on something\\nvery close to the sinister matters of his quest.\\n\\nThe present Negro inhabitants were known to him, and he was very\\ncourteously shown about the interior by old Asa and his stout wife\\nHannah. Here there was more change than the outside indicated, and Ward\\nsaw with regret that fully half of the fine scroll-and-urn overmantels\\nand shell-carved cupboard linings were gone, whilst much of the fine\\nwainscotting and bolection moulding was marked, hacked, and gouged,\\nor covered up altogether with cheap wall-paper. It was exciting to\\nstand within the ancestral walls which had housed such a man of horror\\nas Joseph Curwen; he saw with a thrill that a monogram had been very\\ncarefully effaced from the ancient brass knocker.\\n\\nFrom then until after the close of school Ward spent his time on the\\nphotostatic copy of the Hutchinson cipher and the accumulation of local\\nCurwen data. The former still proved unyielding; but of the latter\\nhe obtained so much, and so many clues to similar data elsewhere,\\nthat he was ready by July to make a trip to New London and New York\\nto consult old letters whose presence in those places was indicated.\\nThis trip was very fruitful, for it brought him the Fenner letters\\nwith their terrible description of the Pawtuxet farmhouse raid, and\\nthe Nightingale-Talbot letters in which he learned of the portrait\\npainted on a panel of the Curwen library. This matter of the portrait\\ninterested him particularly, since he would have given much to know\\njust what Joseph Curwen looked like; and he decided to make a second\\nsearch of the house in Olney Court to see if there might not be some\\ntrace of the ancient features beneath peeling coats of later paint or\\nlayers of mouldy wall-paper.\\n\\nEarly in August that search took place, and Ward went carefully\\nover the walls of every room sizeable enough to have been by any\\npossibility the library of the evil builder. He paid especial attention\\nto the large panels of such overmantels as still remained; and was\\nkeenly excited after about an hour, when on a broad area above the\\nfireplace in a spacious ground-floor room he became certain that the\\nsurface brought out by the peeling of several coats of paint was\\nsensibly darker than any ordinary interior paint or the wood beneath it\\nwas likely to have been. A few more careful tests with a thin knife,\\nand he knew that he had come upon an oil portrait of great extent.\\nWith truly scholarly restraint the youth did not risk the damage which\\nan immediate attempt to uncover the hidden picture with the knife\\nmight have done, but just retired from the scene of his discovery to\\nenlist expert help. In three days he returned with an artist of long\\nexperience, Mr. Walter C. Dwight, whose studio is near the foot of\\nCollege Hill; and that accomplished restorer of paintings set to work\\nat once with proper methods and chemical substances. Old Asa and his\\nwife were duly excited over their strange visitors, and were properly\\nreimbursed for this invasion of their domestic hearth.\\n\\nAs day by day the work of restoration progressed, Charles Ward looked\\non with growing interest at the lines and shades gradually unveiled\\nafter their long oblivion. Dwight had begun at the bottom; hence since\\nthe picture was a three-quarter-length one, the face did not come out\\nfor some time. It was meanwhile seen that the subject was a spare,\\nwell-shaped man with dark-blue coat, embroidered waistcoat, black satin\\nsmall-clothes, and white silk stockings, seated in a carved chair\\nagainst the background of a window with wharves and ships beyond. When\\nthe head came out it was observed to bear a neat Albemarle wig, and\\nto possess a thin, calm, undistinguished face which seemed somehow\\nfamiliar to both Ward and the artist. Only at the very last, though,\\ndid the restorer and his client begin to gasp with astonishment\\nat the details of that lean, pallid visage, and to recognize with\\na touch of awe the dramatic trick which heredity had played. For\\nit took the final bath of oil and the final stroke of the delicate\\nscraper to bring out fully the expression which centuries had hidden;\\nand to confront the bewildered Charles Dexter Ward, dweller in the\\npast, with his own living features in the countenance of his horrible\\ngreat-great-great-grandfather.\\n\\nWard brought his parents to see the marvel he had uncovered, and\\nhis father at once determined to purchase the picture despite its\\nexecution on stationary panelling. The resemblance to the boy, despite\\nan appearance of rather greater age, was marvelous; and it could\\nbe seen that through some trick of atavism the physical contours\\nof Joseph Curwen had found precise duplication after a century and\\na half. Mrs. Ward\\'s resemblance to her ancestor was not at all\\nmarked, though she could recall relatives who had some of the facial\\ncharacteristics shared by her son and by the bygone Curwen. She did\\nnot relish the discovery, and told her husband that he had better\\nburn the picture instead of bringing it home. There was, she averred,\\nsomething unwholesome about it; not only intrinsically, but in its very\\nresemblance to Charles. Mr. Ward, however, was a practical man of power\\nand affairsâ\\x80\\x94a cotton manufacturer with extensive mills at Riverpoint\\nin the Pawtuxet Valleyâ\\x80\\x94and not one to listen to feminine scruples.\\nThe picture impressed him mightily with its likeness to his son, and\\nhe believed the boy deserved it as a present. In this opinion, it is\\nneedless to say, Charles most heartily concurred; and a few days later\\nMr. Ward located the owner of the houseâ\\x80\\x94a small rodent-featured person\\nwith a guttural accentâ\\x80\\x94and obtained the whole mantel and overmantel\\nbearing the picture at a curtly fixed price which cut short the\\nimpending torrent of unctuous haggling.\\n\\nIt now remained to take off the panelling and remove it to the Ward\\nhome, where provisions were made for its thorough restoration and\\ninstallation with an electric mock-fireplace in Charles\\' third-floor\\nstudy or library. To Charles was left the task of superintending\\nthis removal, and on the twenty-eighth of August he accompanied two\\nexpert workmen from the Crooker decorating firm to the house in Olney\\nCourt, where the mantel and portrait-bearing overmantel were detached\\nwith great care and precision for transportation in the company\\'s\\nmotor truck. There was left a space of exposed brickwork marking the\\nchimney\\'s course, and in this young Ward observed a cubical recess\\nabout a foot square, which must have lain directly behind the head\\nof the portrait. He found, beneath the deep coatings of dust and\\nsoot some loose yellowed papers, a crude, thick copy-book, and a few\\nmoldering textile shreds which may have formed the ribbon binding the\\nrest together. Blowing away the bulk of the dirt and cinders, he took\\nup the book and looked at the bold inscription on its cover. It was in\\na hand which he had learned to recognize at the Essex Institute, and\\nproclaimed the volume as the \" Journall and Notes of Jos. Curwen,\\nGent., of Providence-Plantations, Late of Salem. \"\\n\\nExcited beyond measure by his discovery, Ward showed the book to the\\ntwo curious workmen beside him. Their testimony is absolute as to\\nthe nature and genuineness of the finding, and Dr. Willett relies on\\nthem to help establish his theory that the youth was not mad when he\\nbegan his major eccentricities. All the other papers were likewise in\\nCurwen\\'s handwriting, and one of them seemed especially portentous\\nbecause of its inscription: \" To Him Who Shal Come After, How He May\\nGett Beyonde Time and Ye Spheres. \" Another was in a cipher; the\\nsame, Ward hoped, as the Hutchinson cipher which had hitherto baffled\\nhim. A third, and here the searcher rejoiced, seemed to be a key to\\nthe cipher; whilst the fourth and fifth were addressed respectively to\\n\"Edw. Hutchinson, Armiger\" and \"Jedediah Orne, Esq.\", \"or Their Heir or\\nHeirs, or Those Represent\\'g Them.\" The sixth and last was inscribed:\\n\" Joseph Curwen his Life and Travells Bet\\'n ye yeares 1678 and 1687:\\nof Whither He Voyag\\'d, Where He Stay\\'d, Whom He Sawe, and What He\\nlearnt. \"\\n\\nWe have now reached the point from which the more academic school of\\nalienists date Charles Ward\\'s madness. Upon his discovery the youth\\nhad looked immediately at a few of the inner pages of the book and\\nmanuscripts, and had evidently seen something which impressed him\\ntremendously. Upon returning home he broke the news with an almost\\nembarrassed air, as if he wished to convey an idea of its supreme\\nimportance without having to exhibit the evidence itself. He did not\\neven show the titles to his parents, but simply told them that he\\nhad found some documents in Joseph Curwen\\'s handwriting, \"mostly in\\ncipher,\" which would have to be studied very carefully before yielding\\nup their true meaning. It is unlikely that he would have shown what he\\ndid to the workmen, had it not been for their unconcealed curiosity. As\\nit was he doubtless wished to avoid any display of peculiar reticence\\nwhich would increase their discussion of the matter.\\n\\nThat night Charles Ward sat up in his room reading the new-found book\\nand papers, and when day came he did not desist. His meals, on his\\nurgent request when his mother called to see what was amiss, were\\nsent up to him; and in the afternoon he appeared only briefly when\\nthe men came to install the Curwen picture and mantelpiece in his\\nstudy. The next night he slept in snatches in his clothes, meanwhile\\nwrestling feverishly with the unraveling of the cipher manuscript. In\\nthe morning his mother saw that he was at work on the photostatic copy\\nof the Hutchinson cipher, which he had frequently showed her before;\\nbut in response to her query he said that the Curwen key could not be\\napplied to it. That afternoon he abandoned his work and watched the\\nmen fascinatedly as they finished their installation of the picture\\nwith its woodwork above a cleverly realistic electric log, setting the\\nmock-fireplace and overmantel a little out from the north wall as if a\\nchimney existed, and boxing in its sides with panelling to match the\\nroom\\'s. After the workmen went he moved his work into the study and\\nsat down before it with his eyes half on the cipher and half on the\\nportrait which stared back at him like a year-adding century-recalling\\nmirror. His parents subsequently recalling his conduct at this period,\\ngive interesting details anent the policy of concealment which he\\npracticed. Before servants he seldom hid any paper which he might be\\nstudying, since he rightly assumed that Curwen\\'s intricate and archaic\\nchirography would be too much for them. With his parents, however,\\nhe was more circumspect; and unless the manuscript in question were\\na cipher, or a mere mass of cryptic symbols and unknown ideographs\\n(as that entitled \" To Him Who Shal Come After etc.\" seemed to\\nbe) he would cover it with some convenient paper until his caller had\\ndeparted. At night he kept the papers under lock and key in an antique\\ncabinet of his, where he also placed them whenever he left the room.\\nHe soon resumed fairly regular hours and habits, except that his long\\nwalks and other outside interests seemed to cease. The opening of\\nschool, where he now began his senior year, seemed a great bore to\\nhim; and he frequently asserted his determination never to bother with\\ncollege. He had, he said, important special investigations to make,\\nwhich would provide him with more avenues toward knowledge and the\\nhumanities than any university which the world could boast.\\n\\nDuring October Ward began visiting the libraries again, but no longer\\nfor the antiquarian matter of his former days. Witchcraft and magic,\\noccultism and daemonology, were what he sought now; and when Providence\\nsources proved unfruitful he would take the train for Boston and tap\\nthe wealth of the great library in Copley Square, the Widener Library\\nat Harvard, or the Zion Research Library in Brookline, where certain\\nrare works on Biblical subjects are available. He bought extensively,\\nand fitted up a whole additional set of shelves in his study for newly\\nacquired works on uncanny subjects; while during the Christmas holidays\\nhe made a round of out-of-town trips including one to Salem to consult\\ncertain records at the Essex Institute.\\n\\nAbout the middle of January, 1920, there entered Ward\\'s bearing an\\nelement of triumph which he did not explain, and he was no more found\\nat work upon the Hutchinson cipher. Instead, he inaugurated a dual\\npolicy of chemical research and record-scanning; fitting up for the\\none a laboratory in the unused attic of the house, and for the latter\\nhaunting all the sources of vital statistics in Providence. Local\\ndealers in drugs and scientific supplies, later questioned, gave\\nastonishingly queer and meaningless catalogues of the substances and\\ninstruments he purchased; but clerks at the State House, the City Hall,\\nand the various libraries agree as to the definite object of his second\\ninterest. He was searching intensely and feverishly for the grave of\\nJoseph Curwen, from whose slate slab an older generation had so wisely\\nblotted the name.\\n\\nLittle by little there grew upon the Ward family the conviction that\\nsomething was wrong. His school work was the merest pretence; he had\\nother concernments now; and when not in his new laboratory with a score\\nof obsolete alchemical books, could be found either poring over old\\nburial records downtown or glued to his volumes of occult lore in his\\nstudy, where the startlinglyâ\\x80\\x94one almost fancied increasinglyâ\\x80\\x94similar\\nfeatures of Joseph Curwen stared blandly at him from the great\\novermantel on the north wall.\\n\\nLate in March Ward added to his archive-searching a ghoulish series of\\nrambles about the various ancient cemeteries of the city. His quest\\nhad suddenly shifted from the grave of Joseph Curwen to that of one\\nNaphthali Field; and this shift was explained when, upon going over\\nthe files that he had been over, the investigators actually found a\\nfragmentary record of Curwen\\'s burial which had escaped the general\\nobliteration, and which stated that the curious leaden coffin had been\\ninterred \"10 ft. S. and 5 ft. W. of Naphthali Field\\'s grave in yeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94.\"\\nHence the ramblesâ\\x80\\x94from which St. John\\'s (the former King\\'s) churchyard\\nand the ancient Congregational burying ground in the midst of Swan\\nPoint Cemetery were excluded, since other statistics had shewn that the\\nonly Naphthali Field (obit. 1729) whose grave could have been meant had\\nbeen a Baptist.\\n\\nIt was toward May when Dr. Willett, at the request of the senior Ward,\\nand fortified with all the Curwen data which the family had gleaned\\nfrom Charles in his non-secretive days, talked with the young man. The\\ninterview was of little value or conclusiveness, for Willett felt at\\nevery moment that Charles was thoroughly master of himself and in touch\\nwith matters of real importance; but it at least forced the secretive\\nyouth to offer some rational explanation of his recent demeanor. Of a\\npallid, impassive type not easily showing embarrassment, Ward seemed\\nquite ready to discuss his pursuits, though not to reveal their object.\\nHe stated that the papers of his ancestor had contained some remarkable\\nsecrets of early scientific knowledge. To take their vivid place in the\\nhistory of human thought they must first be correlated by one familiar\\nwith the background out of which they evolved, and to this task of\\ncorrelation Ward was now devoting himself. He was seeking to acquire as\\nfast as possible those neglected arts of old which a true interpreter\\nof the Curwen data must possess, and hoped in time to make a full\\nannouncement and presentation of the utmost interest to mankind and to\\nthe world of thought.\\n\\nAs to his graveyard search, whose object he freely admitted, but the\\ndetails of whose progress he did not relate, he said he had reason to\\nthink that Joseph Curwen\\'s mutilated headstone bore certain mystic\\nsymbolsâ\\x80\\x94carved from directions in his will and ignorantly spared by\\nthose who had effaced the nameâ\\x80\\x94which were absolutely essential to the\\nfinal solution of his cryptic system. Curwen, he believed, had wished\\nto guard his secret with care; and had consequently distributed the\\ndata in an exceedingly curious fashion. When Dr. Willett asked to see\\nthe mystic documents, Ward displayed much reluctance and tried to put\\nhim off with such things as the photostatic copies of the Hutchinson\\ncipher and Orne formulae and diagrams; but finally showed him the\\nexteriors of some of the real Curwen findsâ\\x80\\x94the \" Journal and\\nNotes ,\" the cipher (title in cipher also) and the formula-filled\\nmessage \" To Him Who Shal Come After \"â\\x80\\x94and let him glance inside\\nsuch as were in obscure characters.\\n\\nHe also opened the diary at a page carefully selected for its\\ninnocuousness and gave Willett a glimpse of Curwen\\'s connected\\nhandwriting in English. The doctor noted very closely the crabbed and\\ncomplicated letters, and the general aura of the seventeenth century\\nwhich clung round both penmanship and style despite the writer\\'s\\nsurvival into the eighteenth century, and became quickly certain that\\nthe document was genuine. The text itself was relatively trivial, and\\nWillett recalled only a fragment. But when Dr. Willett turned the leaf,\\nhe was quickly checked by Ward, who almost snatched the book from his\\ngrasp. All that the doctor had a chance to see on the newly opened page\\nwas a brief pair of sentences; but these, strangely enough, lingered\\ntenaciously in his memory.\\n\\nThey ran: \"Ye Verse from Liber-Damnatus be\\'g spoke V Roodmasses and IV\\nHallows-Eves, I am Hopeful ye Thing is breed\\'g Outside ye Spheres. It\\nwill drawe One who is to Come if I can make sure he shal bee, and he\\nshall think on Past thinges and looke back thro\\' all ye yeares, against\\nye which I must have ready ye Saltes or That to make \\'em with.\"\\n\\nWillett saw no more, but somehow this small glimpse gave a new and\\nvague terror to the painted features of Joseph Curwen which stared\\nblandly down from the overmantel. Ever after that he entertained the\\nodd fancyâ\\x80\\x94which his medical skill of course assured him was only a\\nfancyâ\\x80\\x94that the eyes of the portrait had a sort of tendency to follow\\nyoung Charles Ward as he moved about the room. He stopped before\\nleaving to study the picture closely, marveling at its resemblance to\\nCharles and memorizing every minute detail of the cryptical, colorless\\nface, even down to a slight scar or pit in the smooth brow above the\\nright eye.\\n\\nAssured by the doctor that Charles\\' mental health was in no danger,\\nbut that on the other hand he was engaged in researches which might\\nprove of real importance, the Wards were more lenient than they might\\notherwise have been when during the following June the youth made\\npositive his refusal to attend college. He had, he declared, studies\\nof much more vital importance to pursue; and intimated a wish to go\\nabroad the following year in order to avail himself of certain sources\\nof data not existing in America. The senior Ward, while denying this\\nlatter wish as absurd for a boy of only eighteen, acquiesced regarding\\nthe university; so that after a none too brilliant graduation from the\\nMoses Brown School there ensued for Charles a three year period of\\nintensive occult study and graveyard searching.\\n\\nComing of age in April, 1923, and having previously inherited a small\\ncompetence from his maternal grandfather, Ward determined at last to\\ntake the European trip hitherto denied him. Of his proposed itinerary\\nhe would say nothing save that the needs of his studies would carry\\nhim to many places, but he promised to write his parents fully and\\nfaithfully. When they saw he could not be dissuaded, they ceased all\\nopposition and helped as best they could; so that in June the young\\nman sailed for Liverpool with the farewell blessings of his father\\nand mother, who accompanied him to Boston and waved him out of sight\\nfrom the White Star pier in Charlestown. Letters soon told of his safe\\narrival, and of his securing good quarters in Great Russell Street,\\nLondon; where he proposed to stay, shunning all family friends, till\\nhe had exhausted the resources of the British Museum in a certain\\ndirection. Of his daily life he wrote but little, for there was little\\nto write. Study and experiment consumed all his time, and he mentioned\\na laboratory which he had established in one of his rooms. That he\\nsaid nothing of antiquarian rambles in the glamorous old city with its\\nluring skyline of ancient domes and steeples and its tangles of roads\\nand alleys whose mystic convolutions and sudden vistas alternately\\nbeckon and surprise, was taken by his parents as a good index of the\\ndegree to which his new interests had engrossed his mind.\\n\\nIn June, 1924, a brief note told of his departure for Paris, to\\nwhich he had before made one or two flying trips for material in the\\nBibliotheque Nationale. For three months thereafter he sent only postal\\ncards, giving an address in the Rue St. Jacques and referring to a\\nspecial search among rare manuscripts in the library of an unnamed\\nprivate collector. He avoided acquaintances, and no tourists brought\\nback reports of having seen him. Then came a silence, and in October\\nthe Wards received a picture card from Prague, Czecho-Slovakia, stating\\nthat Charles was in that ancient town for the purpose of conferring\\nwith a certain very aged man supposed to be the last living possessor\\nof some very curious mediaeval information. He gave an address in\\nthe Newstadt, and announced no move till the following January; when\\nhe dropped several cards from Vienna telling of his passage through\\nthat city on the way toward a more easterly region whither one of his\\ncorrespondents and fellow-delvers into the occult had invited him.\\n\\nThe next card was from Klausenburg in Transylvania, and told of\\nWard\\'s progress toward his destination. He was going to visit a Baron\\nFerenczy, whose estate lay in the mountains east of Rakus; and was to\\nbe addressed at Rakus in the care of that nobleman. Another card from\\nRakus a week later, saying that his host\\'s carriage had met him and\\nthat he was leaving the village for the mountains, was his last message\\nfor a considerable time; indeed, he did not reply to his parents\\'\\nfrequent letters until May, when he wrote to discourage the plan of his\\nmother for a meeting in London, Paris, or Rome during the summer, when\\nthe elder Wards were planning to travel in Europe. His researches, he\\nsaid, were such that he could not leave his present quarters; while\\nthe situation of Baron Ferenczy\\'s castle did not favor visits. It was\\non a crag in the dark wooded mountains, and the region was so shunned\\nby the country folk that normal people could not help feeling ill at\\nease. Moreover, the Baron was not a person likely to appeal to correct\\nand conservative New England gentlefolk. His aspect and manners had\\nidiosyncrasies, and his age was so great as to be disquieting. It would\\nbe better, Charles said, if his parents would wait for his return to\\nProvidence; which could scarcely be far distant.\\n\\nThat return did not, however, take place until May, 1925, when after a\\nfew heralding cards the young wanderer quietly slipped into New York\\non the Homeric and traversed the long miles to Providence by\\nmotor coach eagerly drinking in the green rolling hills, the fragrant,\\nblossoming orchards, and the white steepled towns of Connecticut in\\nspring; his first taste of ancient New England in nearly four years.\\n\\nOld Providence! It was this place and the mysterious forces of its\\nlong, continuous history which had brought him into being, and which\\nhad drawn him back toward marvels and secrets whose boundaries no\\nprophet might fix. Here lay the arcana, wondrous or dreadful as the\\ncase might be, for which all his years of travel and application\\nhad been preparing him. A taxicab whirled him through Post Office\\nSquare with its glimpse of the river, and up the steep curved slope\\nof Waterman Street to Prospect. Then eight squares past the fine old\\nestates his childish eyes had known, and the quaint brick sidewalks\\nso often trodden by his youthful feet. And at last the little white\\novertaken farmhouse on the right, and on the left the classic Adam\\nporch and stately bayed faÃ§ade of the great brick house where he was\\nborn. It was twilight, and Charles Dexter Ward had come home.\\n\\nWard was now visibly aged and hardened, but was still normal in his\\ngeneral reactions; and in several talks with Willett displayed\\na balance which no madmanâ\\x80\\x94even an incipient oneâ\\x80\\x94could feign\\ncontinuously for long. What elicited the notion of insanity at this\\nperiod were the sounds heard at all hours from Ward\\'s attic\\nlaboratory, in which he kept himself most of the time. There were\\nchantings and repetitions, and thunderous declamations in uncanny\\nrhythms; and although these sounds were always in Ward\\'s own voice,\\nthere was something in the quality of that voice and in the accents\\nof the formulae it pronounced, which could not but chill the blood of\\nevery hearer. It was noticed that Nig, the venerable and beloved black\\ncat of the household, bristled and arched his back perceptibly when\\ncertain of the tones were heard.\\n\\nThe odors occasionally wafted from the laboratory were likewise\\nexceedingly strange. Sometimes they were very noxious, but more often\\nthey were aromatic, with a haunting, elusive quality which seemed to\\nhave the power of inducing fantastic images. People who smelled them\\nhad a tendency to glimpse momentary mirages of enormous vistas, with\\nstrange hills or endless avenues of sphinxes and hippogriffs stretching\\noff into infinite distance. His older aspect increased to a startling\\ndegree his resemblance to the Curwen portrait in his library; and Dr.\\nWillett would often pause by the latter after a call, marvelling at\\nthe virtual identity, and reflecting that only the small pit above the\\npicture\\'s right eye now remained to differentiate the long-dead wizard\\nfrom the living youth. Frequently he noted peculiar things about;\\nlittle wax images of grotesque design on the shelves or tables, and the\\nhalf-erased remnants of circles, triangles, and pentagrams in chalk or\\ncharcoal on the cleared central space of the large room. And always\\nin the night those rhythms and incantations thundered, till it became\\nvery difficult to keep servants or suppress furtive talk of Charles\\'\\nmadness.\\n\\nIn January, 1927, a peculiar incident occurred. One night about\\nmidnight, as Charles was chanting a ritual whose weird cadence echoed\\nunpleasantly through the house below, there came a sudden gust of chill\\nwind from the bay, and a faint, obscure trembling of the earth which\\neveryone in the neighborhood noted. At the same time the cat exhibited\\nphenomenal traces of fright, while dogs bayed for as much as a mile\\naround. This was the prelude to a sharp thunderstorm, anomalous for\\nthe season, which brought with it such a crash that Mr. and Mrs. Ward\\nbelieved the house had been struck. They rushed upstairs to see what\\ndamage had been done, but Charles met them at the door to the attic;\\npale, resolute, and portentous, with an almost fearsome combination of\\ntriumph and seriousness on his face. He assured them that the house\\nhad not really been struck, and that the storm would soon be over.\\nThe thunder sank to a sort of dull mumbling chuckle and finally died\\naway. Stars came out, and the stamp of triumph on Charles Ward\\'s face\\ncrystallized into a very singular expression.\\n\\nFor two months or more after this incident Ward was less confined\\nthan usual to his laboratory. He exhibited a curious interest in the\\nweather, and made odd inquiries about the date of the spring thawing of\\nthe ground. One night late in March he left the house after midnight,\\nand did not return till almost morning; when his mother, being wakeful,\\nheard a rumbling motor draw up the carriage entrance. Muffled oaths\\ncould be distinguished, and Mrs. Ward, rising and going to the window,\\nsaw four dark figures removing a long, heavy box from a truck at\\nCharles\\' direction and carrying it within by the side door. She heard\\nlabored breathing and ponderous footfalls on the stairs, and finally a\\ndull thumping in the attic; after which the footfalls descended again,\\nand the four men reappeared outside and drove off in their truck.\\n\\nThe next day Charles resumed his strict attic seclusion, drawing\\ndown the dark shades of his laboratory windows and appearing to be\\nworking on some metal substance. He would open the door to no one,\\nand steadfastly refused all proffered food. About noon a wrenching\\nsound followed by a terrible cry and a fall were heard, but when Mrs.\\nWard rapped at the door her son at length answered faintly, and told\\nher that nothing had gone amiss. The hideous and indescribable stench\\nnow welling out was absolutely harmless and unfortunately necessary.\\nSolitude was the one prime essential, and he would appear later for\\ndinner. That afternoon, after the conclusion of some odd hissing sounds\\nwhich came from behind the locked portal, he did finally appear;\\nwearing an extremely haggard aspect and forbidding anyone to enter\\nthe laboratory upon any pretext. This, indeed, proved the beginning\\nof a new policy of secrecy; for never afterward was any other person\\npermitted to visit either the mysterious garret workroom or the\\nadjacent storeroom which he cleared out, furnished roughly, and added\\nto his inviolably private domain as a sleeping apartment. Here he\\nlived, with books brought up from his library beneath, till the time\\nhe purchased the Pawtuxet bungalow and moved to it all his scientific\\neffects.\\n\\nIn the evening Charles secured the paper before the rest of the family\\nand damaged part of it through an apparent accident. Later on Dr.\\nWillett, having fixed the date from statements by various members of\\nthe household, looked up an intact copy at the Journal office\\nand found that in the destroyed section the following small item had\\noccurred:\\n\\nNocturnal Diggers Surprised in North Burial Ground\\n\\nRobert Hart, night watchman at the North Burial Ground, this morning\\ndiscovered a party of several men with a motor truck in the oldest\\npart of the cemetery, but apparently frightened them off before they\\nhad accomplished whatever their object may have been.\\n\\nThe discovery took place at about four o\\'clock, when Hart\\'s\\nattention was attracted by the sound of a motor outside his shelter.\\nInvestigating, he saw a large truck on the main drive several rods\\naway; but could not reach it before the sound of his feet on the\\ngravel had revealed his approach. The men hastily placed a large box\\nin the truck and drove away toward the street before they could be\\novertaken; and since no known grave was disturbed, Hart believes that\\nthis box was an object which they wished to bury.\\n\\nThe diggers must have been at work for a long while before detection,\\nfor Hart found an enormous hole dug at a considerable distance back\\nfrom the roadway in the lot of Amosa Field, where most of the old\\nstones have long ago disappeared. The hole, a place as large and\\ndeep as a grave, was empty; and did not coincide with any interment\\nmentioned in the cemetery records.\\n\\nSergeant Riley of the Second Station viewed the spot and gave the\\nopinion that the hole was dug by bootleggers rather gruesomely and\\ningeniously seeking a safe cache for liquor in a place not likely to\\nbe disturbed. In reply to questions Hart said he thought the escaping\\ntruck had headed up Rochambeau Avenue, though he could not be sure.\\n\\nDuring the next few days Charles Ward was seldom seen by his family.\\nHaving added sleeping quarters to his attic realm, he kept closely to\\nhimself there, ordering food brought to the door and not taking it\\nin until after the servant had gone away. The droning of monotonous\\nformulae and the chanting of bizarre rhythms recurred at intervals,\\nwhile at other times occasional listeners could detect the sound of\\ntinkling glass, hissing chemicals, running water, or roaring gas\\nflames. Odors of the most unplaceable quality, wholly unlike any before\\nnoted, hung at times around the door; and the air of tension observable\\nin the young recluse whenever he did venture briefly forth was such as\\nto excite the keenest speculation. Once he made a hasty trip to the\\nAthenaeum for a book he required, and again he hired a messenger to\\nfetch him a highly obscure volume from Boston. Suspense was written\\nportentously over the whole situation, and both the family and Dr.\\nWillett confessed themselves wholly at a loss what to do or think about\\nit.\\n\\nThen on the fifteenth of April a strange development occurred. While\\nnothing appeared to grow different in kind, there was certainly a very\\nterrible difference in degree; and Dr. Willett somehow attaches great\\nsignificance to the change. The day was Good Friday, a circumstance of\\nwhich the servants made much, but which others quite naturally dismiss\\nas an irrelevant coincidence. Late in the afternoon young Ward began\\nrepeating a certain formula in a singularly loud voice, at the same\\ntime burning some substance so pungent that its fumes escaped over the\\nentire house. The formula was so plainly audible in the hall outside\\nthe locked door that Mrs. Ward could not help memorizing it as she\\nwaited and listened anxiously, and later on she was able to write it\\ndown at Dr. Willett\\'s request. It ran as follows, and experts have told\\nDr. Willett that its very close analogue can be found in the mystic\\nwritings of \"Eliphas Levi,\" that cryptic soul who crept through a crack\\nin the forbidden door and glimpsed the frightful vistas of the void\\nbeyond:\\n\\nPer Adonai Eloim, Adonai Jehova, Adonai Sabaoth, Metraton Ou Agla\\nMethon, verbum pythonicum, mysterium salamandrae, conventus sylvorum,\\nantra, gnomorum, daemonia Coeli God, Almonsin, Gibor, Jehosua, Evam,\\nZariatnatmik, veni, veni, veni.\\n\\nThis had been going on for two hours without change or intermission\\nwhen over all the neighborhood a pandemoniac howling of dogs set in.\\nThe extent of this howling can be judged from the space it received\\nin the papers the next day, but to those in the Ward household it was\\nover-shadowed by the odor which instantly followed it; a hideous,\\nall-pervasive odour which none of them had ever smelt before or have\\never smelt since. In the midst of this mephitic flood there came a\\nvery perceptible flash like that of lightning, which would have been\\nblinding and impressive but for the daylight around; and then was heard the voice that no listener can ever forget because of its thunderous\\nremoteness, its incredible depth, and its eldritch dissimilarity to\\nCharles Ward\\'s voice. It shook the house, and was clearly heard by at\\nleast two neighbors above the howling of the dogs. Mrs. Ward, who had\\nbeen listening in despair outside her son\\'s locked laboratory, shivered\\nas she recognized its hellish import; for Charles had told her of its\\nevil fame in dark books, and of the manner in which it had thundered,\\naccording to the Fenner letters, above the doomed Pawtuxet farmhouse on\\nthe night of Joseph Curwen\\'s annihilation. There was no mistaking that\\nnightmare phrase, for Charles had described it too vividly in the old\\ndays when he had talked frankly of his Curwen investigations. And yet\\nit was only this fragment of an archaic and forgotten language: \"DIES\\nMIES JESCHET BOENE DOESEF DOUVEMA ENITEMAUS.\"\\n\\nClose upon this thundering there came a momentary darkening\\nof the daylight, though sunset was still an hour distant,\\nand then a puff of added odor, different from the first but\\nequally unknown and intolerable. Charles was chanting again\\nnow and his mother could hear syllables that sounded like\\n\"Yi-ngah-Yog-Sothoth-he-lglb-fi-throdag\"â\\x80\\x94ending in a \"Yah!\" whose\\nmaniacal force mounted in an ear-splitting crescendo. A second later\\nall previous memories were effaced by the wailing scream which burst\\nout with frantic explosiveness and gradually changed form to a paroxysm\\nof diabolic and hysterical laughter. Mrs. Ward, with the mingled fear\\nand blind courage of maternity, advanced and knocked affrightedly\\nat the concealing panels, but obtained no sign of recognition. She\\nknocked again, but paused nervelessly as a second shriek arose, this\\none unmistakably in the familiar voice of her son, and sounding\\nconcurrently with the still bursting cachinnations of that other\\nvoice . Presently she fainted, although she is still unable to recall\\nthe precise and immediate cause. Memory sometimes makes merciful\\ndeletions.\\n\\nMr. Ward returned from the business section at about quarter past\\nsix; and not finding his wife downstairs, was told by the frightened\\nservants that she was probably watching at Charles\\' door, from which\\nthe sounds had been far stranger than ever before. Mounting the stairs\\nat once, he saw Mrs. Ward stretched at full length on the floor of the\\ncorridor outside the laboratory; and realizing that she had fainted,\\nhastened to fetch a glass of water from a set bowl in a neighboring\\nalcove. Dashing the cold fluid in her face, he was heartened to observe\\nan immediate response on her part, and was watching the bewildered\\nopening of her eyes when a chill shot through him and threatened to\\nreduce him to the very state from which she was emerging. For the\\nseemingly silent laboratory was not as silent as it had appeared to be,\\nbut held the murmurs of a tense, muffled conversation in tones too low\\nfor comprehension, yet of a quality profoundly disturbing to the soul.\\n\\nIt was not, of course, new for Charles to mutter formulae; but this\\nmuttering was definitely different. It was so palpably a dialogue, or\\nimitation of a dialogue, with the regular alternation of inflections\\nsuggesting question and answer, statement and response. One voice\\nwas undisguisedly that of Charles, but the other had a depth and\\nhollowness which the youth\\'s best powers of ceremonial mimicry had\\nscarcely approached before. There was something hideous, blasphemous,\\nand abnormal about it, and but for a cry from his recovering wife\\nwhich cleared his mind by arousing his protective instincts, it is not\\nlikely that Theodore Howland Ward could have maintained for nearly\\na year more his old boast that he had never fainted. As it was, he\\nseized his wife in his arms and bore her quickly downstairs before\\nshe could notice the voices which had so horribly disturbed him. Even\\nso, however, he was not quick enough to escape catching something\\nhimself which caused him to stagger dangerously with his burden. For\\nMrs. Ward\\'s cry had evidently been heard by others than he and there\\nhad come in response to it from behind the locked door the first\\ndistinguishable words which that hushed and terrible colloquy had\\nyielded. They were merely an excited caution in Charles\\' own voice, but\\nsomehow their implications held a nameless fright for the father who\\noverheard them. The phrase was just this: \" Sshh!â\\x80\\x94write! \"\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Ward conferred at some length after dinner, and the former\\nresolved to have a firm and serious talk with Charles that very night.\\nNo matter how important the object, such conduct could no longer be\\npermitted; for these latest developments transcended every limit of\\nsanity and formed a menace to the order and nervous well-being of the\\nentire household. The youth must indeed have taken complete leave of\\nhis senses, since only downright madness could have prompted the wild\\nscreams and imaginary conversations in assumed voices which the present\\nday had brought forth. All this must be stopped, or Mrs. Ward would be\\nmade ill and the keeping of servants become an impossibility.\\n\\nMr. Ward rose at the close of the meal and started upstairs for\\nCharles\\' laboratory. On the third floor, however, he paused at the\\nsounds which he heard proceeding from the now disused library of his\\nson. Books were apparently being flung about and papers wildly rustled,\\nand upon stepping to the door Mr. Ward beheld the youth within,\\nexcitedly assembling a vast armful of literary matter of every size\\nand shape. Charles\\' aspect was very drawn and haggard, and he dropped\\nhis entire load with a start at the sound of his father\\'s voice. At\\nthe elder man\\'s command he sat down, and for some time listened to the\\nadmonitions he had so long deserved. There was no scene. At the end of\\nthe lecture he agreed that his father was right, and that his noises,\\nmutterings, incantations, and chemical odors were indeed inexcusable\\nnuisances. For the fright and fainting of his mother he expressed the\\nkeenest contrition, and explained that the conversation later heard\\nwas part of an elaborate symbolism designed to create a certain mental\\natmosphere. His use of abstruse chemical terms somewhat bewildered\\nMr. Ward, but the parting impression was one of undeniable sanity and\\npoise, despite a mysterious tension of the utmost gravity. Mr. Ward\\nhardly knew what to make of the entire business. It was as mysterious\\nas the death of poor old Nig, whose stiffening form had been found an\\nhour before in the basement, with staring eyes and fear-distorted mouth.\\n\\nDriven by some vague detective instinct, the bewildered parent now\\nglanced curiously at the vacant shelves to see what his son had\\ntaken up to the attic. The youth\\'s library was plainly and rigidly\\nclassified, so that one might tell at a glance the books or at least\\nthe kind of books which had been withdrawn. On this occasion Mr. Ward\\nwas astonished to find that nothing of the occult or the antiquarian,\\nbeyond what had been previously removed, was missing. These new\\nwithdrawals were all modern items; histories, scientific treatises,\\ngeographies, manuals of literature, philosophic works, and certain\\ncontemporary newspapers and magazines. It was a very curious shift\\nfrom Charles Ward\\'s recent run of reading, and the father paused in a\\ngrowing vortex of perplexity and an engulfing sense of strangeness. The\\nstrangeness was a very poignant sensation, and almost clawed at his\\nchest as he strove to see just what was wrong around him. Something was\\nindeed wrong, and tangibly as well as spiritually so.\\n\\nOn the north wall rose still the ancient carved overmantel from the\\nhouse in Olney Court, but to the cracked and precariously restored\\noils of the large Curwen portrait disaster had come. Time and unequal\\nheating had done their work at last, and at some time since the room\\'s\\nlast cleaning the worst had happened. Peeling clear of the wood,\\ncurling tighter and tighter, and finally crumbling into small bits with\\nwhat must have been malignly silent suddenness, the portrait of Joseph\\nCurwen had resigned for ever its staring surveillance of the youth it\\nso strangely resembled, and now lay scattered on the floor as a thin\\ncoating of fine bluish-gray dust.\\n\\n4. A Mutation and a Madness\\n\\nIn the week following that memorable Good Friday, Charles Ward was seen\\nmore often than usual, and was continually carrying books between his\\nlibrary and the attic laboratory. His actions were quiet and rational,\\nbut he had a furtive, hunted look which his mother did not like, and\\ndeveloped an incredibly ravenous appetite as gauged by his demands upon\\nthe cook.\\n\\nDr. Willett had been told of those Friday noises and happenings, and\\non the following Tuesday had a long conversation with the youth in the\\nlibrary where the picture stared no more. The interview was, as always,\\ninconclusive; but Willett is still ready to swear that the youth\\nwas sane and himself at the time. He held out promises of an early\\nrevelation, and spoke of the need of securing a laboratory elsewhere.\\nAt the loss of the portrait he grieved singularly little considering\\nhis first enthusiasm over it, but seemed to find something of positive\\nhumor in its sudden crumbling.\\n\\nAbout the second week Charles began to be absent from the house for\\nlong periods, and one day when good old black Hannah came to help with\\nthe spring cleaning she mentioned his frequent visits to the old house\\nin Olney Court, where he would come with a large valise and perform\\ncurious delvings in the cellar. He was always very liberal to her and\\nto old Asa, but seemed more worried than he used to be; which grieved\\nher very much, since she had watched him grow up from birth.\\n\\nAnother report of his doings came from Pawtuxet, where some friends\\nof the family saw him at a distance a surprising number of times. He\\nseemed to haunt the resort and canoe-house of Rhodes-on-the-Pawtuxet,\\nand subsequent inquiries by Dr. Willett at that place brought out\\nthe fact that his purpose was always to secure access to the rather\\nhedged-in river-bank, along which he would walk toward the north,\\nusually not reappearing for a very long while.\\n\\nLater in May came a momentary revival of ritualistic sounds in the\\nattic laboratory which brought a stern reproof from Mr. Ward and a\\nsomewhat distracted promise of amendment from Charles. It occurred one\\nmorning, and seemed to form a resumption of the imaginary conversation\\nnoted on that turbulent Good Friday. The youth was arguing or\\nremonstrating hotly with himself, for there suddenly burst forth a\\nperfectly distinguishable series of clashing shouts in differentiated\\ntones like alternate demands and denials, which caused Mrs. Ward to run\\nupstairs and listen at the door. She could hear no more than a fragment\\nwhose only plain words were \"must have it red for three months,\" and\\nupon her knocking all sounds ceased at once. When Charles was later\\nquestioned by his father he said that there were certain conflicts of\\nspheres of consciousness which only great skill could avoid, but which\\nhe would try to transfer to other realms.\\n\\nAbout the middle of June a queer nocturnal incident occurred. In the\\nearly evening there had been some noise and thumping in the laboratory\\nupstairs, and Mr. Ward was on the point of investigating when it\\nsuddenly quieted down. That midnight, after the family had retired, the\\nbutler was nightlocking the front door when according to his statement\\nCharles appeared somewhat blunderingly and uncertainly at the foot of\\nthe stairs with a large suitcase and made signs that he wished egress.\\nThe youth spoke no word, but the worthy Yorkshireman caught one sight\\nof his fevered eyes and trembled causelessly. He opened the door and\\nyoung Ward went out, but in the morning he presented his resignation to\\nMrs. Ward. There was, he said, something unholy in the glance Charles\\nhad fixed on him. It was no way for a young gentleman to look at an\\nhonest person, and he could not possibly stay another night. Mrs. Ward\\nallowed the man to depart, but she did not value his statement highly.\\nTo fancy Charles in a savage state that night was quite ridiculous, for\\nas long as she had remained awake she had heard faint sounds from the\\nlaboratory above; sounds as if of sobbing and pacing, and of a sighing\\nwhich told only of despair\\'s profoundest depths. Mrs. Ward had grown\\nused to listening for sounds in the night, for the mystery of her son\\nwas fast driving all else from her mind.\\n\\nThe next evening, much as on another evening nearly three months\\nbefore, Charles Ward seized the newspaper very early and accidentally\\nlost the main section. This matter was not recalled till later,\\nwhen Dr. Willett began checking up loose ends and searching out\\nmissing links here and there. In the Journal office he found the\\nsection which Charles had lost, and marked two items as of possible\\nsignificance. They were as follows:\\n\\nMore Cemetery Delving\\n\\nIt was this morning discovered by Robert Hart, night watchman at the\\nNorth Burial ground, that ghouls were again at work in the ancient\\nportion of the cemetery. The grave of Ezra Weeden, who was born\\nin 1740 and died in 1824 according to his uprooted and savagely\\nsplintered slate headstone, was found excavated and rifled, the work\\nbeing evidently done with a spade stolen from an adjacent tool shed.\\n\\nWhatever the contents may have been after more than a century of\\nburial, all was gone except a few slivers of decayed wood. There\\nwere no wheel tracks, but the police have measured a single set of\\nfootprints which they found in the vicinity, and which indicate the\\nboots of a man of refinement.\\n\\nHart is inclined to link this incident with the digging discovered\\nlast March, when a party in a motor truck were frightened away after\\nmaking a deep excavation; but Sergeant Riley of the Second Station\\ndiscounts this theory and points to vital differences in the two\\ncases. In March the digging had been in a spot where no grave was\\nknown; but this time a well-marked and cared-for grave had been\\nrifled with every evidence of deliberate purpose and with a conscious\\nmalignity expressed in the splintering of the slab which had been\\nintact up to the day before.\\n\\nMembers of the Weeden family, notified of the happening, expressed\\ntheir astonishment and regret; and were wholly unable to think of any\\nenemy who would care to violate the grave of their ancestor. Hazard\\nWeeden of 598 Angell Street recalls a family legend according to which\\nEzra Weeden was involved in some very peculiar circumstances, not\\ndishonourable to himself, shortly before the Revolution; but of any\\nmodern feud or mystery he is frankly ignorant. Inspector Cunningham\\nhas been assigned to the case, and hopes to uncover some valuable\\nclues in the near future.\\n\\nDogs Noisy in Pawtuxet\\n\\nResidents of Pawtuxet were aroused about three A.M. today by a\\nphenomenal baying of dogs which seemed to centre near the river just\\nnorth of Rhodes-on-the-Pawtuxet. The volume and quality of the howling\\nwere unusually odd, according to most who heard it; and Fred Lemdin,\\nnight watchman at Rhodes, declares it was mixed with something very\\nlike the shrieks of a man in mortal terror and agony. A sharp and very\\nbrief thunderstorm, which seemed to strike somewhere near the bank\\nof the river, put an end to the disturbance. Strange and unpleasant\\nodours, probably from the oil tanks along the bay, are popularly\\nlinked with this incident; and may have had their share in exciting\\nthe dogs.\\n\\nThe aspect of Charles now became very haggard and hunted, and all\\nagree in retrospect that he may have wished at this period to make\\nsome statement or confession from which sheer terror withheld him. The\\nmorbid listening of his mother in the night brought out the fact that\\nhe made frequent sallies abroad under cover of darkness, and most of\\nthe more academic alienists unite at present in charging him with the\\nrevolting cases of vampirism which the press so sensationally reported\\nabout this time, but which have not yet been definitely traced to any\\nknown perpetrator. These cases, too recent and celebrated to need\\ndetailed mention, involved victims of every age and type and seemed\\nto cluster around two distinct localities; the residential hill and\\nthe North End, near the Ward home, and the suburban districts across\\nthe Cranston line near Pawtuxet. Both late wayfarers and sleepers with\\nopen windows were attacked, and those who lived to tell the tale spoke\\nunanimously of a lean, lithe, leaping monster with burning eyes which\\nfastened its teeth in the throat or upper arm and feasted ravenously.\\n\\n\"These cases of Vampirism involved victims of every age and type.\"\\n\\nDr. Willett, who refuses to date the madness of Charles Ward as far\\nback as even this, is cautious in attempting to explain these horrors.\\nHe has, he declares, certain theories of his own; and limits his\\npositive statements to a peculiar kind of negation. \"I will not,\"\\nhe says, \"state who or what I believe perpetrated these attacks and\\nmurders, but I will declare that Charles Ward was innocent of them. I\\nhave reason to be sure he was ignorant of the taste of blood, as indeed\\nhis continued anaemic decline and increasing pallor prove better than\\nany verbal argument. Ward meddled with terrible things, but he has paid\\nfor it, and he was never a monster or a villain.\\n\\n\"As for now, I don\\'t like to think. A change came, and I\\'m content to\\nbelieve that the old Charles Ward died with it. His soul did, anyhow,\\nfor that mad flesh that vanished from Waite\\'s hospital had another.\"\\n\\nWillett speaks with authority, for he was often at the Ward home\\nattending Mrs. Ward, whose nerves had begun to snap under the strain.\\nHer nocturnal listening had bred some morbid hallucinations which\\nshe confided to the doctor with hesitancy, and which he ridiculed in\\ntalking to her, although they made him ponder deeply when alone. These\\ndelusions always concerned the faint sounds which she fancied she heard\\nin the attic laboratory and bedroom, and emphasized the occurrence\\nof muffled sighs and sobbings at the most impossible times. Early in\\nJuly Willett ordered Mrs. Ward to Atlantic City for an indefinite\\nrecuperative sojourn, and cautioned both Mr. Ward and the haggard and\\nelusive Charles to write her only cheering letters. It is probably\\nto this enforced and reluctant escape that she owes her life and\\ncontinued sanity.\\n\\nNot long after his mother\\'s departure Charles Ward began negotiating\\nfor the Pawtuxet bungalow. It was a squalid little wooden edifice with\\na concrete garage, perched high on the sparsely settled bank of the\\nriver slightly above Rhodes, but for some odd reason the youth would\\nhave nothing else. He gave the real-estate agencies no peace till one\\nof them secured it for him at an exorbitant price from a somewhat\\nreluctant owner, and as soon as it was vacant he took possession under\\ncover of darkness, transporting in a great closed van the entire\\ncontents of his attic laboratory, including the books both weird and\\nmodern which he had borrowed from his study. He had this van loaded in\\nthe black small hours, and his father recalls only a drowsy realization\\nof stifled oaths and stamping feet on the night the goods were taken\\naway. After that Charles moved back to his own old quarters on the\\nthird floor, and never haunted the attic again.\\n\\nTo the Pawtuxet bungalow Charles transferred all the secrecy with\\nwhich he had surrounded his attic realm, save that he now appeared to\\nhave two sharers of his mysteries; a villainous-looking Portuguese\\nhalf-caste from the South Main Street Waterfront who acted as a\\nservant, and a thin scholarly stranger with dark glasses and a\\nstubbly full beard of dyed aspect whose status was evidently that of\\na colleague. Neighbors vainly tried to engage these odd persons in\\nconversation. The mulatto, Gomes, spoke very little English, and the\\nbearded man who gave his name as Dr. Allen voluntarily followed his\\nexample. Ward himself tried to be more affable, but succeeded only in\\nprovoking curiosity with his rambling accounts of chemical research.\\nBefore long queer tales began to circulate regarding the all-night\\nburning of lights; and somewhat later, after this burning had suddenly\\nceased, there rose still queerer tales of disproportionate orders of\\nmeat from the butcher\\'s and of the muffled shouting, declamation,\\nrhythmic chanting, and screaming supposed to come from some very deep\\ncellar below the place. Most distinctly the new and strange household\\nwas bitterly disliked by the honest bourgeoisie of the vicinity, and it\\nis not remarkable that dark hints were advanced connecting the hated\\nestablishment with the current epidemic of vampiristic attacks and\\nmurders; especially since the radius of that plague seemed now confined\\nwholly to Pawtuxet and the adjacent streets of Edgewood.\\n\\nWard spent most of his time at the bungalow, but slept occasionally at\\nhome and was still reckoned a dweller beneath his father\\'s roof. Twice\\nhe was absent from the city on week-long trips, whose destinations have\\nnot yet been discovered. He grew steadily paler and more emaciated even\\nthan before, and lacked some of his former assurance when repeating\\nto Dr. Willett his old, old story of vital research and future\\nrevelations. Willett often waylaid him at his father\\'s house, for the\\nelder Ward was deeply worried and perplexed, and wished his son to get\\nas much sound oversight as could be managed in the case of so secretive\\nand independent an adult. The doctor still insists that the youth was\\nsane even as late as this, and adduces many a conversation to prove his\\npoint.\\n\\nAbout September the vampirism declined, but in the following January,\\nWard almost became involved in serious trouble. For some time the\\nnocturnal arrival and departure of motor trucks at the Pawtuxet\\nbungalow had been commented upon, and at this juncture an unforeseen\\nhitch exposed the nature of at least one item of their contents. In a\\nlonely spot near Hope Valley had occurred one of the frequent sordid\\nwaylayings of trucks by \"hi-jackers\" in quest of liquor shipments,\\nbut this time the robbers had been destined to receive the greater\\nshock. For the long cases they seized proved upon opening to contain\\nsome exceedingly gruesome things; so gruesome, in fact, that the matter\\ncould not be kept quiet amongst the denizens of the underworld. The\\nthieves had hastily buried what they discovered, but when the State\\nPolice got wind of the matter a careful search was made. A recently\\narrested vagrant, under promise of immunity from prosecution on any\\nadditional charge, at last consented to guide a party of troopers to\\nthe spot; and there was found in that hasty cache a very hideous and\\nshameful thing. It would not be well for the nationalâ\\x80\\x94or even the\\ninternationalâ\\x80\\x94sense of decorum if the public were ever to know what\\nwas uncovered by that awestruck party. There was no mistaking it, even\\nby these far from studious officers; and telegrams to Washington ensued\\nwith feverish rapidity.\\n\\nThe cases were addressed to Charles Ward at his Pawtuxet bungalow,\\nand State and Federal officials at once paid him a very forceful and\\nserious call. They found him pallid and worried with his two odd\\ncompanions, and received from him what seemed to be a valid explanation\\nand evidence of innocence. He had needed certain anatomical specimens\\nas part of a program of research whose depth and genuineness anyone\\nwho had known him in the last decade could prove, and had ordered\\nthe required kind and number from agencies which he had thought as\\nreasonably legitimate as such things can be. Of the identity of the\\nspecimens he had known absolutely nothing, and was properly shocked\\nwhen the inspectors hinted at the monstrous effect on public sentiment\\nand national dignity which a knowledge of the matter would produce. In\\nthis statement he was firmly sustained by his bearded colleague Dr.\\nAllen, whose oddly hollow voice carried even more conviction than his\\nown nervous tones; so that in the end the officials took no action,\\nbut carefully set down the New York name and address which Ward gave\\nthem as a basis for a search which came to nothing. It is only fair\\nto add that the specimens were quickly and quietly restored to their\\nproper places, and that the general public will never know of their\\nblasphemous disturbance.\\n\\nOn February 9, 1928, Dr. Willett received a letter from Charles Ward\\nwhich he considers of extraordinary importance, and about which he has\\nfrequently quarreled with Dr. Lyman. Lyman believes that this note\\ncontains positive proof of a well-developed case of dementia praecox ,\\nbut Willett on the other hand regards it as the last perfectly sane\\nutterance of the hapless youth. He calls especial attention to the\\nnormal character of the penmanship; which though shewing traces of\\nshattered nerves, is nevertheless distinctly Ward\\'s own. The text in\\nfull is as follows:\\n\\n100 Prospect St., Providence, R. I., March 8, 1928.\\n\\nDear Dr. Willettâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nI feel that at last the time has come for me to make the disclosures\\nwhich I have so long promised you, and for which you have pressed me\\nso often. The patience you have shewn in waiting, and the confidence\\nyou have shewn in my mind and integrity, are things I shall never\\ncease to appreciate.\\n\\nAnd now that I am ready to speak, I must own with humiliation that no\\ntriumph such as I dreamed of can ever be mine. Instead of triumph I\\nhave found terror, and my talk with you will not be a boast of victory\\nbut a plea for help and advice in saving both myself and the world\\nfrom a horror beyond all human conception or calculation. You recall\\nwhat those Fenner letters said of the old raiding party at Pawtuxet.\\nThat must all be done again, and quickly. Upon us depends more than\\ncan be put into wordsâ\\x80\\x94all civilisation, all natural law, perhaps even\\nthe fate of the solar system and the universe. I have brought to light\\na monstrous abnormality, but I did it for the sake of knowledge. Now\\nfor the sake of all life and nature you must help me thrust it back\\ninto the dark again.\\n\\nI have left that Pawtuxet place forever, and we must extirpate\\neverything existing there, alive or dead. I shall not go there again,\\nand you must not believe it if you ever hear that I am there. I will\\ntell you why I say this when I see you. I have come home for good, and\\nwish you would call on me at the very first moment that you can spare\\nfive or six hours continuously to hear what I have to say. It will\\ntake that longâ\\x80\\x94and believe me when I tell you that you never had a\\nmore genuine professional duty than this. My life and reason are the\\nvery least things which hang in the balance.\\n\\nI dare not tell my father, for he could not grasp the whole thing. But\\nI have told him of my danger, and he has four men from a detective\\nagency watching the house. I don\\'t know how much good they can do, for\\nthey have against them forces which even you could scarcely envisage\\nor acknowledge. So come quickly if you wish to see me alive and hear\\nhow you may help to save the cosmos from stark hell.\\n\\nAny time will doâ\\x80\\x94I shall not be out of the house. Don\\'t telephone\\nahead, for there is no telling who or what may try to intercept you.\\nAnd let us pray to whatever gods there be that nothing may prevent\\nthis meeting.\\n\\nIn utmost gravity and desperation,\\n\\nCharles Dexter Ward.\\n\\nP. S.â\\x80\\x94Shoot Dr. Allen on sight and dissolve his body in acid. Don\\'t\\nburn it.\\n\\nDr. Willett received this note about ten-thirty a.m., and immediately\\narranged to spare the whole late afternoon and evening for the\\nmomentous talk, letting it extend on into the night as long as might\\nbe necessary. He planned to arrive about four o\\'clock, and through\\nall the intervening hours was so engulfed in every sort of wild\\nspeculation that most of his tasks were very mechanically performed.\\nManiacal as the letter would have sounded to a stranger, Willett had\\nseen too much of Charles Ward\\'s oddities to dismiss it as sheer raving.\\nThat something very subtle, ancient, and horrible was hovering about\\nhe felt quite sure, and the reference to Dr. Allen could almost be\\ncomprehended in view of what Pawtuxet gossip said of Ward\\'s enigmatical\\ncolleague. Willett had never seen the man, but had heard much of his\\naspect and bearing, and could not but wonder what sort of eyes those\\nmuch-discussed dark glasses might conceal.\\n\\nPromptly at four Dr. Willett presented himself at the Ward residence,\\nbut found to his annoyance that Charles had not adhered to his\\ndetermination to remain indoors. The guards were there, but said that\\nthe young man seemed to have lost part of his timidity. He had that\\nmorning done much apparently frightened arguing and protesting over\\nthe telephone, one of the detectives said, replying to some unknown\\nvoice with phrases such as \"I am very tired and must rest awhile,\"\\n\"I can\\'t receive anyone for some time, you\\'ll have to excuse me,\"\\n\"Please postpone decisive action till we can arrange some sort of\\ncompromise,\" or \"I am very sorry, but I must take a complete vacation\\nfrom everything; I\\'ll talk with you later.\" Then, apparently gaining\\nboldness through meditation, he had slipped out so quietly that no one\\nhad seen him depart or knew that he had gone until he returned about\\none o\\'clock and entered the house without a word. He had gone upstairs,\\nwhere a bit of his fear must have surged back; for he was heard to cry\\nout in a high terrified fashion upon entering his library, afterward\\ntrailing off into a kind of choking gasp. When, however, the butler had\\ngone to inquire what the trouble was, he had appeared at the door with\\na great show of boldness, and had silently gestured the man away in a\\nmanner that terrified him unaccountably. Then he had evidently done\\nsome rearranging of his shelves, for a great clattering and thumping\\nand creaking ensued; after which he had reappeared and left at once.\\nWillett inquired whether or not any message had been left, but was\\ntold that there was none. The butler seemed queerly disturbed about\\nsomething in Charles\\' appearance and manner, and asked solicitously if\\nthere was much hope for a cure of his disordered nerves.\\n\\nFor almost two hours Dr. Willett waited vainly in Charles Ward\\'s\\nlibrary, watching the dusty shelves with their wide gaps where books\\nhad been removed, and smiling grimly at the paneled overmantel on\\nthe north wall, whence a year before the suave features of old Joseph\\nCurwen had looked mildly down. After a time the shadows began to\\ngather, and the sunset cheer gave place to a vague growing terror which\\nflew shadow-like before the night. Mr. Ward finally arrived, and showed\\nmuch surprise and anger at his son\\'s absence after all the pains which\\nhad been taken to guard him. He had not known of Charles\\' appointment,\\nand promised to notify Willett when the youth returned. In bidding\\nthe doctor good night he expressed his utter perplexity at his son\\'s\\ncondition, and urged his caller to do all he could to restore the boy\\nto normal poise. Willett was glad to escape from that library, for\\nsomething frightful and unholy seemed to haunt it; as if the vanished\\npicture had left behind a legacy of evil. He had never liked that\\npicture; and even now, strong-nerved though he was, there lurked a\\nquality in its vacant panel which made him feel an urgent need to get\\nout into the pure air as soon as possible.\\n\\nThe next morning Willett received a message from the senior Ward,\\nsaying that Charles was still absent. Mr. Ward mentioned that Dr.\\nAllen had telephoned him to say that Charles would remain at Pawtuxet\\nfor some time, and that he must not be disturbed. This was necessary\\nbecause Allen himself was suddenly called away for an indefinite\\nperiod, leaving the researches in need of Charles\\' constant oversight.\\nCharles sent his best wishes, and regretted any bother his abrupt\\nchange of plans might have caused. In listening to this message Mr.\\nWard heard Dr. Allen\\'s voice for the first time, and it seemed to\\nexcite some vague and elusive memory which could not be actually\\nplaced, but which was disturbing to the point of fearfulness.\\n\\nFaced by these baffling and contradictory reports, Dr. Willett was\\nfrankly at a loss what to do. The frantic earnestness of Charles\\'\\nnote was not to be denied, yet what could one think of its writer\\'s\\nimmediate violation of his own expressed policy? Young Ward had written\\nthat his delvings had become blasphemous and menacing, that they and\\nhis bearded colleague must be extirpated at any cost, and that he\\nhimself would never return to their final scene; yet according to\\nlatest advices he had forgotten all this and was back in the thick\\nof the mystery. Common sense bade one leave the youth alone with his\\nfreakishness, yet some deeper instinct would not permit the impression\\nof that frenzied letter to subside. Willett read it over again, and\\ncould not make its essence sound as empty and insane as both its\\nbombastic verbiage and its lack of fulfilment would seem to imply.\\nIts terror was too profound and real, and in conjunction with what\\nthe doctor already knew evoked too vivid hints of monstrosities from\\nbeyond time and space, to permit of any cynical explanation. There were\\nnameless horrors abroad; and no matter how little one might be able to\\nget at them, one ought to stand prepared for any sort of action at any\\ntime.\\n\\nFor over a week Dr. Willett pondered on the dilemma which seemed thrust\\nupon him, and became more and more inclined to pay Charles a call at\\nthe Pawtuxet bungalow. No friend of the youth had ever ventured to\\nstorm this forbidden retreat, and even his father knew of its interior\\nonly from such descriptions as he chose to give; but Willett felt that\\nsome direct conversation with his patient was necessary. Mr. Ward had\\nbeen receiving brief and non-committal typed notes from his son, and\\nsaid that Mrs. Ward in her Atlantic City retirement had had no better\\nword. So at length the doctor resolved to act; and despite a curious\\nsensation inspired by old legends of Joseph Curwen, and by more recent\\nrevelations and warnings from Charles Ward, set boldly out for the\\nbungalow on the bluff above the river.\\n\\nWillett had visited the spot before through sheer curiosity, though of\\ncourse never entering the house or proclaiming his presence; hence knew\\nexactly the route to take. Driving out Broad Street one early afternoon\\ntoward the end of February in his small motor, he thought oddly of the\\ngrim party which had taken that selfsame road a hundred and fifty-seven\\nyears before, on a terrible errand which none might ever comprehend.\\n\\nThe ride through the city\\'s decaying fringe was short, and trim\\nEdgewood and sleepy Pawtuxet presently spread out ahead. Willett turned\\nto the right down Lockwood Street and drove his car as far along that\\nrural road as he could, then alighted and walked north to where the\\nbluff towered above the lovely bends of the river and the sweep of\\nmisty downlands beyond. Houses were still few here, and there was no\\nmistaking the isolated bungalow with its concrete garage on a high\\npoint of land at his left. Stepping briskly up the neglected gravel\\nwalk he rapped at the door with a firm hand, and spoke without a tremor\\nto the evil Portuguese mulatto who opened it to the width of a crack.\\n\\nHe must, he said, see Charles Ward at once on vitally important\\nbusiness. No excuse would be accepted, and a repulse would mean only\\na full report of the matter to the elder Ward. The mulatto still\\nhesitated, and pushed against the door when Willett attempted to open\\nit; but the doctor merely raised his voice and renewed his demands.\\nThen there came from the dark interior a husky whisper which somehow\\nchilled the hearer through and through, though he did not know why he\\nfeared it. \"Let him in, Tony,\" it said, \"we may as well talk now as\\never.\" But disturbing as was the whisper, the greater fear was that\\nwhich immediately followed. The floor creaked and the speaker hove in\\nsightâ\\x80\\x94and the owner of those strange and resonant tones was seen to be\\nno other than Charles Dexter Ward.\\n\\nThe minuteness with which Dr. Willett recalled and recorded his\\nconversation of that afternoon is due to the importance he assigns\\nto this particular period. For at last he concedes a vital change in\\nCharles Dexter Ward\\'s mentality, and believes that the youth now spoke\\nfrom a brain hopelessly alien to the brain whose growth he had watched\\nfor six and twenty years. Controversy with Dr. Lyman has compelled him\\nto be very specific, and he definitely dates the madness of Charles\\nWard from the time the typewritten notes began to reach his parents.\\nThose notes are not in Ward\\'s normal style; not even in the style of\\nthat last frantic letter to Willett. Instead, they are strange and\\narchaic, as if the snapping of the writer\\'s mind had released a flood\\nof tendencies and impressions picked up unconsciously through boyhood\\nantiquarianism. There is an obvious effort to be modern, but the spirit\\nand occasionally the language are those of the past.\\n\\nThe past, too, was evident in Ward\\'s every tone and gesture as he\\nreceived the doctor in that shadowy bungalow. He bowed, motioned\\nWillett to a seat, and began to speak abruptly in that strange whisper\\nwhich he sought to explain at the very outset.\\n\\n\"I am grown phthisical,\" he began, \"from this cursed river air. You\\nmust excuse my speech. I suppose you are come from my father to see\\nwhat ails me, and I hope you will say nothing to alarm him.\"\\n\\nWillett was studying these scraping tones with extreme care, but\\nstudying even more closely the face of the speaker. Something, he felt,\\nwas wrong; and he thought of what the family had told him about the\\nfright of that Yorkshire butler one night. He wished it were not so\\ndark, but did not request that any blind be opened. Instead, he merely\\nasked Ward why he had so belied the frantic note of little more than a\\nweek before.\\n\\n\"I was coming to that,\" the host replied. \"You must know, I am in a\\nvery bad state of nerves, and do and say queer things I cannot account\\nfor. As I have told you often, I am on the edge of great matters; and\\nthe bigness of them has a way of making me light-headed. Any man might\\nwell be frighted of what I have found, but I am not to be put off for\\nlong. I was a dunce to have that guard and stick at home; for having\\ngone this far, my place is here. I am not well spoke of by my prying\\nneighbors, and perhaps I was led by weakness to believe myself what\\nthey say of me. There is no evil to any in what I do, so long as I do\\nit rightly. Have the goodness to wait six months, and I\\'ll show you\\nwhat will pay your patience well.\\n\\n\"You may as well know I have a way of learning old matters from things\\nsurer than books, and I\\'ll leave you to judge the importance of what I\\ncan give to history, philosophy, and the arts by reason of the doors\\nI have access to. My ancestor had all this when those witless peeping\\nToms came and murdered him. I now have it again, or am coming very\\nimperfectly to have a part of it. This time nothing must happen, and\\nleast of all through any idiot fears of my own. Pray forget all I writ\\nyou, Sir, and have no fear of this place or any in it. Dr. Allen is a\\nman of fine parts, and I owe him an apology for anything ill I have\\nsaid of him. I wish I had no need to spare him, but there were things\\nhe had to do elsewhere. His zeal is equal to mine in all those matters,\\nand I suppose that when I feared the work I feared him too as my\\ngreatest helper in it.\"\\n\\nWard paused, and the doctor hardly knew what to say or think. He felt\\nalmost foolish in the face of this calm repudiation of the letter;\\nand yet there clung to him the fact that while the present discourse\\nwas strange and alien and indubitably mad, the note itself had been\\ntragic in its naturalness and likeness to the Charles Ward he knew.\\nWillett now tried to turn the talk on early matters, and recall to the\\nyouth some past events which would restore a familiar mood; but in\\nthis process he obtained only the most grotesque results. It was the\\nsame with all the alienists later on. Important sections of Charles\\nWard\\'s store of mental images, mainly those touching modern times and\\nhis own personal life, had been unaccountably expunged; while all the\\nmassed antiquarianism of his youth had welled up from some profound\\nsubconsciousness to engulf the contemporary and the individual. The\\nyouth\\'s ultimate knowledge of elder things was abnormal and unholy, and\\nhe tried his best to hide it. When Willett would mention some favorite\\nobject of his boyhood archaistic studies he often shed by pure accident\\nsuch a light as no normal mortal could conceivably be expected to possess, and\\nthe doctor shuddered as the glib allusion glided by.\\n\\nIt was not wholesome to know so much about the way the fat sheriff\\'s\\nwig fell off as he leaned over at the play in Mr. Douglass\\' Histrionick\\nAcademy in King Street on the eleventh of February, 1762, which fell of\\na Thursday; or about how the actors cut the text of Steele\\'s \"Conscious\\nLover\" so badly that one was almost glad the Baptist-ridden legislature\\nclosed the theater a fortnight later. That Thomas Sabin\\'s Boston coach\\nwas \"damn\\'d uncomfortable\" old letters may well have told; but what\\nhealthy antiquarian could recall how the creaking of Epenetus Olney\\'s\\nnew signboard (the gaudy Crown he set up after he took to calling his\\ntavern the Crown Coffee House) was exactly like the first few notes of\\nthe new jazz piece all the radios in Pawtuxet were playing?\\n\\nWard, however, would not be quizzed long in this vein. Modern and\\npersonal topics he waved aside quite summarily, whilst regarding\\nantique affairs he soon shewed the plainest boredom. What he wished\\nclearly enough was only to satisfy his visitor enough to make him\\ndepart without the intention of returning. To this end he offered to\\nshew Willett the entire house, and at once proceeded to lead the doctor\\nthrough every room from cellar to attic. Willett looked sharply, but\\nnoted that the visible books were far too few and trivial ever to have\\nfilled the wide gaps on Ward\\'s shelves at home, and that the meager\\nso-called \"laboratory\" was the flimsiest sort of a blind. Clearly,\\nthere were a library and a laboratory elsewhere; but just where, it\\nwas impossible to say. Essentially defeated in his quest for something\\nhe could not name, Willett returned to town before evening and told\\nthe senior Ward everything which had occurred. They agreed that the\\nyouth must be definitely out of his mind, but decided that nothing\\ndrastic need be done just then. Above all, Mrs. Ward must be kept in as\\ncomplete an ignorance as her son\\'s own strange typed notes would permit.\\n\\nMr. Ward now determined to call in person upon his son, making it\\nwholly a surprise visit. Dr. Willett took him in his car one evening,\\nguiding him to within sight of the bungalow and waiting patiently for\\nhis return. The session was a long one, and the father emerged in a\\nvery saddened and perplexed state. His reception had developed much\\nlike Willett\\'s, save that Charles had been an excessively long time\\nin appearing after the visitor had forced his way into the hall and\\nsent the Portuguese away with an imperative demand; and in the bearing\\nof the altered son there was no trace of filial affection. The lights\\nhad been dim, yet even so the youth had complained that they dazzled\\nhim outrageously. He had not spoke out loud at all, averring that his\\nthroat was in a very poor condition; but in his hoarse whisper there\\nwas a quality so vaguely disturbing that Mr. Ward could not banish it\\nfrom his mind.\\n\\nNow definitely leagued together to do all they could toward the youth\\'s\\nmental salvation, Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett set about collecting\\nevery scrap of data which the case might afford. Pawtuxet gossip was\\nthe first item they studied, and this was relatively easy to glean\\nsince both had friends in that region. Dr. Willett obtained the most\\nrumors because people talked more frankly to him than to a parent of\\nthe central figure, and from all he heard he could tell that young\\nWard\\'s life had become indeed a strange one. Common tongues would\\nnot dissociate his household from the vampirism of the previous\\nsummer, while the nocturnal comings and goings of the motor trucks\\nprovided their share of dark speculation. Local tradesmen spoke of\\nthe queerness of the orders brought them by the evil-looking mulatto,\\nand in particular of the inordinate amounts of meat and fresh blood\\nsecured from the two butcher shops in the immediate neighborhood. For a\\nhousehold of only three, these quantities were quite absurd.\\n\\nThen there was the matter of the sounds beneath the earth. Reports of\\nthese things were harder to pin down, but all the vague hints tallied\\nin certain basic essentials. Noises of a ritual nature positively\\nexisted, and at times when the bungalow was dark. They might, of\\ncourse, have come from the known cellar; but rumor insisted that there\\nwere deeper and more spreading crypts. Recalling the ancient tales of\\nJoseph Curwen\\'s catacombs, and assuming for granted that the present\\nbungalow had been selected because of its situation on the old Curwen\\nsite as revealed in one or another of the documents found behind the\\npicture, Willett and Mr. Ward gave this phase of the gossip much\\nattention; and searched many times without success for the door in the\\nriver bank which old manuscripts mentioned. As to popular opinions of\\nthe bungalow\\'s various inhabitants, it was soon plain that the Brava\\nPortuguese was loathed, the bearded and spectacled Dr. Allen feared,\\nand the pallid young scholar disliked to a profound extent. During\\nthe last week or two Ward had obviously changed much, abandoning his\\nattempts at affability and speaking only in hoarse but oddly repellent\\nwhispers on the few occasions that he ventured forth.\\n\\nSuch were the shreds and fragments gathered here and there; and over\\nthese Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett held many long and serious conferences.\\nThey strove to exercise deduction, induction, and constructive\\nimagination to their utmost extent; and to correlate every known fact\\nof Charles\\' later life, including the frantic letter which the doctor\\nnow shewed the father, with the meager documentary evidence available\\nconcerning old Joseph Curwen. They would have given much for a glimpse\\nof the papers Charles had found, for very clearly the key to the\\nyouth\\'s madness lay in what he had learned of the ancient wizard and\\nhis doings.\\n\\nAnd yet, after all, it was from no step of Mr. Ward\\'s or Dr. Willett\\'s\\nthat the next move in this singular case proceeded. The father and\\nthe physician, rebuffed and confused by a shadow too shapeless and\\nintangible to combat, had rested uneasily on their oars while the\\ntyped notes of young Ward to his parents grew fewer and fewer. Then\\ncame the first of the month with its customary financial adjustments,\\nand the clerks at certain banks began a peculiar shaking of heads and\\ntelephoning from one to the other. Officials who knew Charles Ward\\nby sight went down to the bungalow to ask why every cheque of his\\nappearing at this juncture was a clumsy forgery, and were reassured\\nless than they ought to have been when the youth hoarsely explained\\nthat his hand had lately been so much affected by a nervous shock as\\nto make normal writing impossible. He could, he said, form no written\\ncharacters at all except with great difficulty; and could prove it by\\nthe fact that he had been forced to type all his recent letters, even\\nthose to his father and mother, who would bear out the assertion.\\n\\nWhat made the investigators pause in confusion was not this\\ncircumstance alone, for that was nothing unprecedented or fundamentally\\nsuspicious; nor even the Pawtuxet gossip, of which one or two of them\\nhad caught echoes. It was the muddled discourse of the young man\\nwhich nonplussed them, implying as it did a virtually total loss of\\nmemory concerning important monetary matters which he had had at his\\nfingertips only a month or two before. Something was wrong; for despite\\nthe apparent coherence and rationality of his speech, there could be\\nno normal reason for this ill-concealed blankness on vital points.\\nMoreover, although none of these men knew Ward well, they could not\\nhelp observing the change in his language and manner. They had heard\\nhe was an antiquarian, but even the most hopeless antiquarians do not\\nmake daily use of obsolete phraseology and gestures. Altogether, this\\ncombination of hoarseness, palsied hands, bad memory, and altered\\nspeech and bearing must represent some disturbance or malady of genuine\\ngravity, which, no doubt, formed the basis of the prevailing odd\\nrumors; and after their departure the party of officials decided that a\\ntalk with the senior Ward was imperative.\\n\\nSo on the sixth of March, 1928, there was a long and serious conference\\nin Mr. Ward\\'s office, after which the utterly bewildered father\\nsummoned Dr. Willett in a kind of helpless resignation. Willett looked\\nover the strained and awkward signatures of the cheques, and compared\\nthem in his mind with the penmanship of that last frantic note.\\nCertainly, the change was radical and profound, and yet there was\\nsomething damnably familiar about the new writing. It had crabbed and\\narchaic tendencies of a very curious sort, and seemed to result from a\\ntype of stroke utterly different from that which the youth had always\\nused. It was strangeâ\\x80\\x94but where had he seen it before? On the whole, it\\nwas obvious that Charles was insane. Of that there could be no doubt.\\nAnd since it appeared unlikely that he could handle his property or\\ncontinue to deal with the outside world much longer, something must\\nquickly be done toward his oversight and possible cure. It was then\\nthat the alienists were called in, Drs. Peck and Waite of Providence\\nand Dr. Lyman of Boston, to whom Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett gave the most\\nexhaustive possible history of the case, and who conferred at length\\nin the now unused library of their young patient, examining what books\\nand papers of his were left in order to gain some further notion of\\nhis habitual mental cast. After scanning this material and examining\\nthe meaningless note to Willett, they all agreed that Charles Ward\\'s\\nstudies had been enough to unseat or at least to warp any ordinary\\nintellect, and wished most heartily that they could see his more\\nintimate volumes and documents; but this latter they knew they could\\ndo, if at all, only after a scene at the bungalow itself. Willett now\\nreviewed the whole case with febrile energy; it being at this time that\\nhe obtained the statements of the workmen who had seen Charles find the\\nCurwen documents, and that he collated the incidents of the destroyed\\nnewspaper items, looking up the latter at the Journal office.\\n\\nOn Thursday, the eighth of March, Drs. Willett, Peck, Lyman and Waite,\\naccompanied by Mr. Ward, paid the youth their momentous call; making\\nno concealment of their object and questioning the now acknowledged\\npatient with extreme minuteness. Charles, though he was ordinately\\nlong in answering the summons and was still redolent of strange\\nand noxious laboratory odors when he did finally make his agitated\\nappearance, proved a far from recalcitrant subject; and admitted\\nfreely that his memory and balance had suffered somewhat from close\\napplication to abstruse studies. He offered no resistance when his\\nremoval to other quarters was insisted upon; and seemed, indeed, to\\ndisplay a high degree of intelligence as apart from mere memory. His\\nconduct would have sent his interviewers away in bafflement had not\\nthe persistently archaic trend of his speech and the unmistakable\\nreplacement of modern by ancient ideas in his consciousness marked\\nhim out as one definitely removed from the normal. Of his work he\\nwould say no more to the group of doctors than he had formerly said to\\nhis family and to Dr. Willett, and his frantic note of the previous\\nmonth he dismissed as mere nerves and hysteria. He insisted that the\\nshadowy bungalow possessed no library or laboratory beyond the visible\\nones, and waxed abstruse in explaining the absence from the house of\\nsuch odors as now saturated all his clothing. Neighborhood gossip he\\nattributed to nothing more than the cheap inventiveness of baffled\\ncuriosity. Of the whereabouts of Dr. Allen he said he did not feel\\nat liberty to speak definitely, but assured his inquisitors that the\\nbearded and spectacled man would return when needed. In paying off\\nthe stolid Brava who resisted all questioning by the visitors, and in\\nclosing the bungalow which still seemed to hold such nighted secrets,\\nWard shewed no sign of nervousness save a barely noticed tendency to\\npause as though listening for something very faint. He was apparently\\nanimated by a calmly philosophic resignation, as if his removal were\\nthe merest transient incident which would cause the least trouble if\\nfacilitated and disposed of once and for all. It was clear that he\\ntrusted to his obviously unimpaired keenness of absolute mentality to\\novercome all the embarrassments into which his twisted memory, his\\nlost voice and handwriting, and his secretive and eccentric behavior\\nhad led him. His mother, it was agreed, was not to be told of the\\nchange; his father supplying typed notes in his name. Ward was taken to\\nthe restfully and picturesquely situated private hospital maintained\\nby Dr. Waite on Conanicut Island in the bay, and subjected to the\\nclosest scrutiny and questioning by all the physicians connected\\nwith the case. It was then that the physical oddities were noticed;\\nthe slackened metabolism, the altered skin, and the disproportionate\\nneural reactions. Dr. Willett was the most perturbed of the various\\nexaminers, for he had attended Ward all his life and could appreciate\\nwith terrible keenness the extent of his physical disorganization. Even\\nthe familiar olive-mark on his hip was gone, while on his chest was a\\ngreat black mole or cicatrice which had never been there before, and\\nwhich made Willett wonder whether the youth had ever submitted to any\\nof the \"witch markings\" reputed to be inflicted at certain unwholesome\\nnocturnal meetings in wild and lonely places. The doctor could not keep\\nhis mind off a certain transcribed witch-trial record from Salem which\\nCharles had shewn him in the old non-secretive days, and which read:\\n\"Mr. G. B. on that Nighte putt ye Divell his Marke upon Bridget S.,\\nJonathan A., Simon O., Deliverance W., Joseph C., Susan P., Mehitable\\nC., and Deborah B.\" Ward\\'s face, too, troubled him horribly, till at\\nlength he suddenly discovered why he was horrified. Above the young\\nman\\'s right eye was something which he had never previously noticedâ\\x80\\x94a\\nsmall scar or pit precisely like that in the crumbled painting of\\nold Joseph Curwen, and perhaps attesting some hideous ritualistic\\ninoculation to which both had submitted at a certain stage of their\\noccult careers.\\n\\nWhile Ward himself was puzzling all the doctors at the hospital, a very\\nstrict watch was kept on all mail addressed either to him or to Dr.\\nAllen, which Mr. Ward had ordered delivered at the family home. Willett\\nhad predicted that very little would be found, since any communications\\nof a vital nature would probably have been exchanged by messenger; but\\nin the latter part of March there did come a letter from Prague for Dr.\\nAllen which gave both the doctor and the father deep thought. It was in\\na very crabbed and archaic hand; and though clearly not the effort of a\\nforeigner, shewed almost as singular a departure from modern English as\\nthe speech of young Ward himself. It read:\\n\\nKleinstrasse 11, Altstadt, Prague, 11th Feby. 1928.\\n\\nBrother in Almousin-Metraton!â\\x80\\x94\\n\\nI this day receiv\\'d yr mention of what came up from the Salts I sent\\nyou.

C. in Providence.\\n\\nMr. Ward and Dr. Willett paused in utter chaos before this apparent\\nbit of unrelieved insanity. Only by degrees did they absorb what it\\nseemed to imply. So the absent Dr. Allen, and not Charles Ward, had\\ncome to be the leading spirit at Pawtuxet? That must explain the wild\\nreference and denunciation in the youth\\'s last frantic letter. And\\nwhat of this addressing of the bearded and spectacled stranger as \"Mr.\\nJ. C.?\" There was no escaping the inference, but there are limits to\\npossible monstrosity. Who was \"Simon O.\"; the old man Ward had visited\\nin Prague four years previously? Perhaps, but in the centuries behind\\nthere had been another Simon O.â\\x80\\x94Simon Orne, alias Jedediah, of Salem,\\nwho vanished in 1771, and whose peculiar handwriting Dr. Willett\\nnow unmistakably recognized from the photostatic copies of the Orne\\nformulae which Charles had once shewn him . What horrors and mysteries,\\nwhat contradictions and contraventions of nature, had come back after a\\ncentury and a half to harass Old Providence with her clustered spires\\nand domes?\\n\\nThe father and the old physician, virtually at a loss what to do or\\nthink, went to see Charles at the hospital and questioned him as\\ndelicately as they could about Dr. Allen, and the Prague visit, and\\nabout what he had learned of Simon or Jedediah Orne of Salem. To all\\nthese inquiries the youth was politely non-committal, merely barking\\nin his hoarse whisper that he had found Dr. Allen to have a remarkable\\nspiritual rapport with certain souls from the past, and that any\\ncorrespondent that the bearded man might have in Prague would probably\\nbe similarly gifted. When they left, Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett realized\\nto their chagrin that they had really been the ones under catechism;\\nand that without imparting anything vital himself, the confined youth\\nhad adroitly pumped them of everything the Prague letter had contained.\\n\\nDrs. Peck, Waite, and Lyman were not inclined to attach much\\nimportance to the strange correspondence of young Ward\\'s companion; for\\nthey knew the tendency of kindred eccentrics and monomaniacs to band\\ntogether, and believed that Charles or Allen had merely unearthed an\\nexpatriated counterpartâ\\x80\\x94perhaps one who had seen Orne\\'s handwriting\\nand copied it in an attempt to pose as the bygone character\\'s\\nreincarnation. Allen himself was perhaps a similar case, and may have\\npersuaded the youth into accepting him as an avatar of the long-dead\\nCurwen. Such things had been known before, and on the same basis the\\nhard-headed doctors disposed of Willett\\'s growing disquiet about\\nCharles Ward\\'s present handwriting, as studied from unpremeditated\\nspecimens obtained by various ruses. Willett thought he had placed its\\nodd familiarity at last, and that what it vaguely resembled was the\\nbygone penmanship of old Joseph Curwen himself; but this the other\\nphysicians regarded as a phase of imitativeness only to be expected\\nin a mania of this sort, and refused to grant it any importance\\neither favorable or unfavorable. Recognizing this prosaic attitude\\nin his colleagues, Willett advised Mr. Ward to keep to himself the\\nletter which arrived for Dr. Allen on the second of April from Rakus,\\nTransylvania, in a handwriting so intensely and fundamentally like that\\nof the Hutchinson cipher that both father and physician paused in awe\\nbefore breaking the seal. This read as follows:\\n\\nCastle Ferenczy, 7 March 1928.\\n\\nDear C.â\\x80\\x94\\n\\nHadd a Squd of 20 Militia up to talk about what the Country Folk say.\\nMust digg deeper and have less Hearde.

Providence.\\n\\nBut if Willett and Mr. Ward refrained from shewing this letter to\\nthe alienists, they did not refrain from acting upon it themselves.\\nNo amount of learned sophistry could controvert the fact that the\\nstrangely bearded and spectacled Dr. Allen, of whom Charles\\' frantic\\nletter had spoken as such a monstrous menace, was in close and sinister\\ncorrespondence with two inexplicable creatures whom Ward had visited\\nin his travels and who plainly claimed to be survivals or avatars of\\nCurwen\\'s old Salem colleagues; that he was regarding himself as the\\nreincarnation of Joseph Curwen, and that he entertainedâ\\x80\\x94or was at\\nleast advised to entertainâ\\x80\\x94murderous designs against a \"boy\" who could\\nscarcely be other than Charles Ward. There was organized horror afoot;\\nand no matter who had started it, the missing Allen was by this time\\nat the bottom of it. Therefore, thanking Heaven that Charles was now\\nsafe in the hospital, Mr. Ward lost no time in engaging detectives to\\nlearn all they could of the cryptic bearded doctor; finding whence he\\nhad come and what Pawtuxet knew of him, and if possible discovering\\nhis current whereabouts. Supplying the men with one of the bungalow\\nkeys which Charles had yielded up, he urged them to explore Allen\\'s\\nvacant room which had been identified when the patient\\'s belongings had\\nbeen packed; obtaining what clues they could from any effects he might\\nhave left about. Mr. Ward talked with the detectives in his son\\'s old\\nlibrary, and they felt a marked relief when they left it at last; for\\nthere seemed to hover about the place a vague aura of evil. Perhaps it\\nwas what they had heard of the infamous old wizard whose picture had\\nonce stared from the paneled overmantel, and perhaps it was something\\ndifferent and irrelevant; but in any case they all half-sensed an\\nintangible miasma which centered in that carven vestige of an older\\ndwelling and which at times almost rose to the intensity of a material\\nemanation.\\n\\n5. A Nightmare and a Cataclysm\\n\\nAnd now swiftly followed that hideous experience which has left its\\nindelible mark of fear on the soul of Marinus Bicknell Willett, and\\nhas added a decade to the visible age of one whose youth was even then\\nfar behind. Dr. Willett had conferred at length with Mr. Ward, and had\\ncome to an agreement with him on several points which both felt the\\nalienists would ridicule. There was, they conceded, a terrible movement\\nalive in the world, whose direct connection with a necromancy even\\nolder than the Salem witchcraft could not be doubted. That at least\\ntwo living menâ\\x80\\x94and one other of whom they dared not thinkâ\\x80\\x94were in\\nabsolute possession of minds or personalities which had functioned as\\nearly as 1690 or before was likewise almost unassailably proved even in\\nthe face of all known natural laws. What these horrible creaturesâ\\x80\\x94and\\nCharles Ward as wellâ\\x80\\x94were doing or trying to do seemed fairly clear\\nfrom their letters and from every bit of light both old and new which\\nhad filtered in upon the case. They were robbing the tombs of all the\\nages, including those of the world\\'s wisest and greatest men, in the\\nhope of recovering from bygone ashes some vestige of the consciousness\\nand lore which had once animated and informed them.\\n\\nA hideous traffic was going on among these nightmare ghouls, whereby\\nillustrious bones were bartered with the calm calculativeness of\\nschoolboys swapping books; and from what was extorted from this\\ncenturied dust there was anticipated a power and a wisdom beyond\\nanything which the cosmos had ever seen concentrated in one man or\\ngroup. They had found unholy ways to keep their brains alive, either\\nin the same body or different bodies; and had evidently achieved a way\\nof tapping the consciousness of the dead whom they gathered together.\\nThere had, it seems, been some truth in chimerical old Borellus when\\nhe wrote of preparing from even the most antique remains certain\\n\"Essential Saltes\" from which the shade of a long-dead living thing\\nmight be raised up. There was a formula for evoking such a shade, and\\nanother for putting it down; and it had now been so perfected that it\\ncould be taught successfully. One must be careful about evocations, for\\nthe markers of old graves are not always accurate.\\n\\nWillett and Mr. Ward shivered as they passed from conclusion to\\nconclusion. Thingsâ\\x80\\x94presences or voices of some sortâ\\x80\\x94could be drawn\\ndown from unknown places as well as from the grave, and in this process\\nalso one must be careful. Joseph Curwen had indubitably evoked many\\nforbidden things, and as for Charlesâ\\x80\\x94what might one think of him?\\nWhat forces \"outside the spheres\" had reached him from Joseph Curwen\\'s\\nday and turned his mind on forgotten things? He had been led to find\\ncertain directions, and he had used them. He had talked with the man\\nof horror in Prague and stayed long with the creature in the mountains\\nof Transylvania. And he must have found the grave of Joseph Curwen at\\nlast. That newspaper item and what his mother had heard in the night\\nwere too significant to overlook. Then he had summoned something, and\\nit must have come. That mighty voice aloft on Good Friday, and those different tones in the locked attic laboratory. What were they\\nlike, with their depth and hollowness? Was there not here some awful\\nforeshadowing of the dreaded stranger Dr. Allen with his spectral bass?\\nYes, that was what Mr. Ward had felt with vague horror in his single\\ntalk with the manâ\\x80\\x94if man it wereâ\\x80\\x94over the telephone!\\n\\nWhat hellish consciousness or voice, what morbid shade or presence,\\nhad come to answer Charles Ward\\'s secret rites behind that locked\\ndoor? Those voices heard in argumentâ\\x80\\x94\"must have it red for three\\nmonths\"â\\x80\\x94Good God! Was not that just before the vampirism broke out?\\nThe rifling of Ezra Weeden\\'s ancient grave, and the cries later at\\nPawtuxetâ\\x80\\x94whose mind had planned the vengeance and rediscovered the\\nshunned seat of elder blasphemies? And then the bungalow and the\\nbearded stranger, and the gossip, and the fear. The final madness of\\nCharles neither father nor doctor could attempt to explain, but they\\ndid feel sure that the mind of Joseph Curwen had come to earth again\\nand was following its ancient morbidities. Was demoniac possession\\nin truth a possibility? Allen had something to do with it, and the\\ndetectives must find out more about one whose existence menaced the\\nyoung man\\'s life. In the meantime, since the existence of some vast\\ncrypt beneath the bungalow seemed virtually beyond dispute, some\\neffort must be made to find it. Willett and Mr. Ward, conscious of\\nthe sceptical attitude of the alienists, resolved during their final\\nconference to undertake a joint secret exploration of unparalleled\\nthoroughness; and agreed to meet at the bungalow on the following\\nmorning with valises and with certain tools and accessories suited to\\narchitectural search and underground exploration.\\n\\nThe morning of April sixth dawned clear, and both explorers were at the\\nbungalow by ten o\\'clock. Mr. Ward had the key, and an entry and cursory\\nsurvey were made. From the disordered condition of Dr. Allen\\'s room it\\nwas obvious that the detectives had been there before, and the later\\nsearchers hoped that they had found some clue which might prove of\\nvalue. Of course the main business lay in the cellar; so thither they\\ndescended without much delay, again making the circuit which each had\\nvainly made before in the presence of the mad young owner. For a time\\neverything seemed baffling, each inch of the earthen floor and stone\\nwalls having so solid and innocuous an aspect that the thought of a\\nyawning aperture was scarcely to be entertained. Willett reflected that\\nsince the original cellar was dug without knowledge of any catacombs\\nbeneath, the beginning of the passage would represent the strictly\\nmodern delving of young Ward and his associates, where they had probed\\nfor the ancient vaults whose rumor could have reached them by no\\nwholesome means.\\n\\nThe doctor tried to put himself in Charles\\' place and see how a delver\\nwould be likely to start, but could not gain much inspiration from this\\nmethod. Then he decided on elimination as a policy, and went carefully\\nover the whole subterranean surface both vertical and horizontal,\\ntrying to account for every inch separately. He was soon substantially\\nnarrowed down, and at last had nothing left but the small platform\\nbefore the washtubs, which he had tried once before in vain. Now\\nexperimenting in every possible way, and exerting a double strength,\\nhe finally found that the top did indeed turn and slide horizontally\\non a corner pivot. Beneath it lay a trim concrete surface with an iron\\nman-hole, to which Mr. Ward at once rushed with excited zeal. The\\ncover was not hard to lift, and the father had quite removed it when\\nWillett noticed the queerness of his aspect. He was swaying and nodding\\ndizzily, and in the gust of noxious air which swept up from the black\\npit beneath the doctor soon recognized ample cause.\\n\\nIn a moment Dr. Willett had his fainting companion on the floor above\\nand was reviving him with cold water. Mr. Ward responded feebly, but it\\ncould be seen that the mephitic blast from the crypt had in some way\\ngravely sickened him. Wishing to take no chances, Willett hastened out\\nto Broad Street for a taxicab and had soon dispatched the sufferer home\\ndespite his weak-voiced protests; after which he produced an electric\\ntorch, covered his nostrils with a band of sterile gauze, and descended\\nonce more to peer into the new-found depths. The foul air had now\\nslightly abated, and Willett was able to send a beam of light down the\\nStygian hole. For about ten feet, he saw, it was a sheer cylindrical\\ndrop with concrete walls and an iron ladder; after which the hole\\nappeared to strike a flight of old stone steps which must originally\\nhave emerged to earth somewhat southward of the present building.\\n\\nWillett freely admits that for a moment the memory of the old Curwen\\nlegends kept him from climbing down alone into that malodorous gulf.\\nHe could not help thinking of what Luke Fenner had reported on that\\nlast monstrous night. Then duty asserted itself and he made the plunge,\\ncarrying a great valise for the removal of whatever papers might\\nprove of supreme importance. Slowly, as befitted one of his years,\\nhe descended the ladder and reached the slimy steps below. This was\\nancient masonry, his torch told him; and upon the dripping walls he\\nsaw the unwholesome moss of centuries. Down, down, ran the steps; not\\nspirally, but in three abrupt turns; and with such narrowness that two\\nmen could have passed only with difficulty. He had counted about thirty\\nwhen a sound reached him very faintly; and after that he did not feel\\ndisposed to count any more.\\n\\nIt was a godless sound; one of those low-keyed, insidious outrages\\nof nature which are not meant to be. To call it a dull wail, a\\ndoom-dragged whine, or a hopeless howl of chorused anguish and\\nstricken flesh without mind would be to miss its most quintessential\\nloathesomeness and soul-sickening overtones. Was it for this that\\nWard had seemed to listen on that day he was removed? It was the most\\nshocking thing that Willett had ever heard, and it continued from\\nno determinate point as the doctor reached the bottom of the steps\\nand cast his torchlight around on lofty corridor walls surmounted by\\nCyclopean vaulting and pierced by numberless black archways. The hall\\nin which he stood was perhaps fourteen feet high to the middle of\\nthe vaulting and ten or twelve feet broad. Its pavement was of large\\nchipped flagstones, and its walls and roof were of dressed masonry. Its\\nlength he could not imagine, for it stretched ahead indefinitely into\\nthe blackness. Of the archways, some had doors of the old six-paneled\\ncolonial type, whilst others had none.\\n\\nOvercoming the dread induced by the smell and the howling, Willett\\nbegan to explore these archways one by one; finding beyond them\\nrooms with groined stone ceilings, each of medium size and apparently\\nof bizarre uses. Most of them had fireplaces, the upper courses of\\nwhose chimneys would have formed an interesting study in engineering.\\nNever before or since had he seen such instruments or suggestions\\nof instruments as here loomed up on every hand through the burying\\ndust and cobwebs of a century and a half, in many cases evidently\\nshattered as if by the ancient raiders. For many of the chambers\\nseemed wholly untrodden by modern feet, and must have represented the\\nearliest and most obsolete phases of Joseph Curwen\\'s experimentation.\\nFinally there came a room of obvious modernity, or at least of recent\\noccupancy. There were oil heaters, bookshelves and tables, chairs and\\ncabinets, and a desk piled high with papers of varying antiquity and\\ncontemporaneousness. Candlesticks and oil lamps stood about in several\\nplaces; and finding a match safe handy, Willett lighted such as were\\nready for use.\\n\\nIn the fuller gleam it appeared that this apartment was nothing less\\nthan the latest study or library of Charles Ward. Of the books the\\ndoctor had seen many before, and a good part of the furniture had\\nplainly come from the Prospect Street mansion. Here and there was\\na piece well known to Willett, and the sense of familiarity became\\nso great that he half forgot the noisomeness and the wailing, both\\nof which were plainer here than they had been at the foot of the\\nsteps. His first duty, as planned long ahead, was to find and seize\\nany papers which might seem of vital importance; especially those\\nportentous documents found by Charles so long ago behind the picture\\nin Olney Court. As he searched he perceived how stupendous a task the\\nfinal unraveling would be; for file on file was stuffed with papers\\nin curious hands and bearing curious designs, so that months or even\\nyears might be needed for a thorough deciphering and editing. Once he\\nfound large packets of letters with Prague and Rakus postmarks, and in\\nwriting clearly recognizable as Orne\\'s and Hutchinson\\'s; all of which\\nhe took with him as part of the bundle to be removed in his valise.\\n\\nAt last, in a locked mahogany cabinet once gracing the Ward home,\\nWillett found the batch of old Curwen papers; recognizing them from\\nthe reluctant glimpse Charles had granted him so many years ago. The\\nyouth had evidently kept them together very much as they had been when\\nfirst he found them, since all the titles recalled by the workmen were\\npresent except the papers addressed to Orne and Hutchinson, and the\\ncipher with its key. Willett placed the entire lot in his valise and\\ncontinued his examination of the files. Since young Ward\\'s immediate\\ncondition was the greatest matter at stake, the closest searching was\\ndone among the most obviously recent matter; and in this abundance of\\ncontemporary manuscript one very baffling oddity was noted. That oddity\\nwas the slight amount in Charles\\' normal writing, which indeed included\\nnothing more recent than two months before. On the other hand, there\\nwere literally reams of symbols and formulae, historical notes and\\nphilosophical comment, in a crabbed penmanship absolutely identical\\nwith the ancient script of Joseph Curwen, though of undeniably modern\\ndating. Plainly, a part of the latter-day program had been a sedulous\\nimitation of the old wizard\\'s writing, which Charles seemed to have\\ncarried to a marvelous state of perfection. Of any third hand which\\nmight have been Allen\\'s there was not a trace. If he had indeed\\ncome to be the leader, he must have forced young Ward to act as his\\namanuensis.\\n\\nIn this new material one mystic formula, or rather pair of formulae,\\nrecurred so often that Willett had it by heart before he had half\\nfinished his quest. It consisted of two parallel columns, the left-hand\\none surmounted by the archaic symbol called \"Dragon\\'s Head\" and used\\nin almanacs to indicate the ascending node, and the right-hand one\\nheaded by the corresponding sign of \"Dragon\\'s Tail\" or descending\\nnode. The appearance of the whole was something like this, and almost\\nunconsciously the doctor realized that the second half was no more\\nthan the first written syllabically backward with the exception of the\\nfinal monosyllables and of the odd name Yog-Sothoth , which he had\\ncome to recognize under various spellings from other things he had\\nseen in connection with this horrible matter. The formulae were as\\nfollowsâ\\x80\\x94 exactly so, as Willett is abundantly able to testifyâ\\x80\\x94and\\nthe first one struck an odd note of uncomfortable latent memory in his\\nbrain, which he recognized later when reviewing the events of that\\nhorrible Good Friday of the previous year.\\n\\nSo haunting were these formulae, and so frequently did he come upon\\nthem, that before the doctor knew it he was repeating them under his\\nbreath. Eventually, however, he felt he had secured all the papers he\\ncould digest to advantage for the present; hence resolved to examine no\\nmore till he could bring the sceptical alienists en masse for an ample\\nand more systematic raid. He had still to find the hidden laboratory,\\nso leaving his valise in the lighted room he emerged again into the\\nblack noisome corridor whose vaulting echoed ceaselessly with that dull\\nand hideous whine.\\n\\nThe next few rooms he tried were all abandoned or filled only with\\ncrumbling boxes and ominous-looking leaden coffins; but impressed him\\ndeeply with the magnitude of Joseph Curwen\\'s original operations. He\\nthought of the slaves and seamen who had disappeared, of the graves\\nwhich had been violated in every part of the world, and of what\\nthat final raiding party must have seen; and then he decided it was\\nbetter not to think any more. Once a great stone staircase mounted at\\nhis right, and he deduced that this must have reached to one of the\\nCurwen outbuildingsâ\\x80\\x94perhaps the famous stone edifice with the high\\nslitlike windowsâ\\x80\\x94provided the steps he had descended had led from the\\nsteep-roofed farmhouse. Suddenly the walls seemed to fall away ahead,\\nand the stench and the wailing grew stronger. Willett saw that he had\\ncome upon a vast open space, so great that his torchlight would not\\ncarry across it; and as he advanced he encountered occasional stout\\npillars supporting the arches of the roof.\\n\\nAfter a time he reached a circle of pillars grouped like the monoliths\\nof Stonehenge, with a large carved altar on a base of three steps in\\nthe center; and so curious were the carvings on that altar that he\\napproached to study them with his electric light. But when he saw what\\nthey were he shrank away shuddering, and did not stop to investigate\\nthe dark stains which discolored the upper surface and had spread down\\nthe sides in occasional thin lines. Instead, he found the distant wall\\nand traced it as it swept around in a gigantic circle perforated by\\noccasional black doorways and indented by a myriad of shallow cells\\nwith iron gratings and wrist and ankle bonds on chains fastened to the\\nstone of the concave rear masonry. These cells were empty, but still\\nthe horrible odor and the dismal moaning continued, more insistent\\nnow than ever, and seemingly varied at times by a sort of slippery\\nthumping.\\n\\nFrom that frightful smell and that uncanny noise Willett\\'s attention\\ncould no longer be diverted. Both were plainer and more hideous in the\\ngreat pillared hall than anywhere else, and carried a vague impression\\nof being far below, even in this dark nether world of subterrene\\nmystery. Before trying any of the black archways for steps leading\\nfurther down, the doctor cast his beam of light about the stone-flagged\\nfloor. It was very loosely paved, and at irregular intervals there\\nwould occur a slab curiously pierced by small holes in no definite\\narrangement, while at one point there lay a very long ladder carelessly\\nflung down. To this ladder, singularly enough, appeared to cling a\\nparticularly large amount of the frightful odor which encompassed\\neverything. As he walked slowly about, it suddenly occurred to Willett\\nthat both the noise and the odor seemed strongest directly above the\\noddly pierced slabs, as if they might be crude trap-doors leading down\\nto some still deeper region of horror. Kneeling by one, he worked at it\\nwith his hands, and found that with extreme difficulty he could budge\\nit. At his touch the moaning beneath ascended to a louder key, and only\\nwith vast trepidation did he persevere in the lifting of the heavy\\nstone. A stench unnamable now rose from below, and the doctor\\'s head\\nreeled dizzily as he laid back the slab and turned his torch upon the\\nexposed square yard of gaping blackness.\\n\\nIf he had expected a flight of steps to some wide gulf of ultimate\\nabomination, Willett was destined to be disappointed; for amidst\\nthat foetor and cracked whining he discerned only the brick-faced\\ntop of a cylindrical well perhaps a yard and a half in diameter and\\ndevoid of any ladder or other means of descent. As the light shone\\ndown, the wailing changed suddenly to a series of horrible yelps; in\\nconjunction with which there came again that sound of blind, futile\\nscrambling and slippery thumping. The explorer trembled, unwilling even\\nto imagine what noxious thing might be lurking in that abyss; but in\\na moment mustered up the courage to peer over the rough-hewn brink;\\nlying at full length and holding the torch downward at arm\\'s length to\\nsee what might lie below. For a second he could distinguish nothing\\nbut the slimy, moss-grown brick walls sinking illimitably into that\\nhalf-tangible miasma of murk and foulness and anguished frenzy; and\\nthen he saw that something dark was leaping clumsily and frantically\\nup and down at the bottom of the narrow shaft, which must have been\\nfrom twenty to twenty-five feet below the stone floor where he lay.\\nThe torch shook in his hand, but he looked again to see what manner\\nof living creature might be immured there in the darkness of that\\nunnatural well; left starving by young Ward through all the long month\\nsince the doctors had taken him away, and clearly only one of a vast\\nnumber prisoned in the kindred wells whose pierced stone covers so\\nthickly studded the floor of the great vaulted cavern. Whatever the\\nthings were, they could not lie down in their cramped spaces; but must\\nhave crouched and whined and waited and feebly leaped all those hideous\\nweeks since their master had abandoned them unheeded.\\n\\nBut Marinus Bicknell Willett was sorry that he looked again; for\\nsurgeon and veteran of the dissecting-room though he was, he has not\\nbeen the same since. It is hard to explain just how a single sight of\\na tangible object with measurable dimensions could so shake and change\\na man; and we may only say that there is about certain outlines and\\nentities a power of symbolism and suggestion which acts frightfully\\non a sensitive thinker\\'s perspective and whispers terrible hints\\nof obscure cosmic relationships and unnamable realities behind the\\nprotective illusions of common vision. In that second look Willett\\nsaw such an outline or entity, for during the next few instants he was\\nundoubtedly as stark mad as any inmate of Dr. Waite\\'s private hospital.\\nHe dropped the electric torch from a hand drained of muscular power or\\nnervous coordination, nor heeded the sound of crunching teeth which\\ntold of its fate at the bottom of the pit. He screamed and screamed\\nand screamed in a voice whose falsetto panic no acquaintance of his\\nwould ever have recognized, and though he could not rise to his feet he\\ncrawled and rolled desperately away over the damp pavement where dozens\\nof Tartarean wells poured forth their exhausted whining and yelping\\nto answer his own insane cries. He tore his hands on the rough, loose\\nstones, and many times bruised his head against the frequent pillars,\\nbut still he kept on. Then at last he slowly came to himself in the\\nutter blackness and stench, and stopped his ears against the droning\\nwail into which the burst of yelping had subsided. He was drenched\\nwith perspiration and without means of producing a light; stricken and\\nunnerved in the abysmal blackness and horror, and crushed with a memory\\nhe never could efface. Beneath him dozens of those things still lived,\\nand from one of the shafts the cover was removed. He knew that what he\\nhad seen could never climb up the slippery walls, yet shuddered at the\\nthought that some obscure foothold might exist.\\n\\nWhat the thing was, he would never tell. It was like some of the\\ncarvings on the hellish altar, but it was alive. Nature had never made\\nit in this form, for it was too palpably unfinished . The deficiencies\\nwere of the most surprising sort, and the abnormalities of proportion\\ncould not be described. Willett consents only to say that this type\\nof thing must have represented entities which Ward called up from imperfect salts , and which he kept for servile or ritualistic\\npurposes. If it had not had a certain significance, its image would not\\nhave been carved on that damnable stone. It was not the worst thing\\ndepicted on that stoneâ\\x80\\x94but Willett never opened the other pits. At the\\ntime, the first connected idea in his mind was an idle paragraph from\\nsome of the old Curwen data he had digested long before; a phrase used\\nby Simon or Jedediah Orne in that portentous confiscated letter to the\\nbygone sorcerer:\\n\\n\"Certainly, there was Noth\\'g butt ye liveliest Awfullness in That which\\nH. rais\\'d upp from What he cou\\'d gather onlie a Part of.\"\\n\\nThen, horribly supplementing rather than displacing this image, there\\ncame a recollection of those ancient lingering rumors anent the burned\\nand twisted thing found in the fields a week after the Curwen raid.\\nCharles Ward had once told the doctor what old Slocum said of that\\nobject; that it was neither thoroughly human, nor wholly allied to any\\nanimal which Pawtuxet folk had ever seen or read about.\\n\\nThese words hummed in the doctor\\'s mind as he rocked to and fro,\\nsquatting on the nitrous stone floor. He tried to drive them out,\\nand repeated the Lord\\'s Prayer to himself; eventually trailing off\\ninto a mnemonic hodge-podge like the modernistic \"Waste Land\" of Mr.\\nT. S. Eliot and finally reverting to the oft-repeated dual formula\\nhe had lately found in Ward\\'s underground library: \" Y\\'ai \\'ng-\\'ngah,\\nYog-Sothoth ,\" and so on till the final underlined \" Zhro .\" It seemed\\nto soothe him and he staggered to his feet after a time; lamenting\\nbitterly his fright-lost torch and looking wildly about for any gleam\\nof light in the clutching inkiness of the chilly air. Think he would\\nnot; but he strained his eyes in every direction for some faint glint\\nor reflection of the bright illumination he had left in the library.\\nAfter awhile he thought he detected a suspicion of a glow infinitely\\nfar away, and toward this he crawled in agonized caution on hands and\\nknees amidst the stench and howling, always feeling ahead lest he\\ncollide with the numerous great pillars or stumble into the abominable\\npit he had uncovered.\\n\\nOnce his shaking fingers touched something which he knew must be the\\nsteps leading to the hellish altar, and from this spot he recoiled\\nin loathing. At another time he encountered the pierced slab he had\\nremoved, and here his caution became almost pitiful. But he did not\\ncome upon the dread aperture after all, nor did anything issue from\\nthat aperture to detain him. What had been down there made no sound\\nnor stir. Evidently its crunching of the fallen electric torch had not\\nbeen good for it. Each time Willett\\'s fingers felt a perforated slab\\nhe trembled. His passage over it would sometimes increase the groaning\\nbelow, but generally it would produce no effect at all, since he moved\\nvery noiselessly. Several times during his progress the glow ahead\\ndiminished perceptibly, and he realized that the various candles and\\nlamps he had left must be expiring one by one. The thought of being\\nlost in utter darkness without matches amidst this underground world of\\nnightmare labyrinths impelled him to rise to his feet and run, which he\\ncould safely do now that he had passed the open pit; for he knew that\\nonce the light failed his only hope of rescue and survival would lie\\nin whatever relief party Mr. Ward might send after missing him for a\\nsufficient period.\\n\\nPresently, however, he emerged from the open space into the narrower\\ncorridor and definitely located the glow as coming from a door on his\\nright. In a moment he had reached it and was standing once more in\\nyoung Ward\\'s secret library, trembling with relief, and watching the\\nsputterings of that last lamp which had brought him to safety.\\n\\nIn another moment he was hastily filling the burned-out lamps from an\\noil supply he had previously noticed, and when the room was bright\\nagain he looked about to see if he might find a lantern for further\\nexploration. For racked though he was with horror, his sense of\\ngrim purpose was still uppermost, and he was firmly determined to\\nleave no stone unturned in his search for the hideous facts behind\\nCharles Ward\\'s bizarre madness. Failing to find a lantern, he chose\\nthe smallest of the lamps to carry; also filling his pockets with\\ncandles and matches, and taking with him a gallon can of oil, which\\nhe proposed to keep for reserve use in whatever hidden laboratory he\\nmight uncover beyond the terrible open space with its unclean altar and\\nnameless covered wells. To traverse that space again would require his\\nutmost fortitude, but he knew it must be done. Fortunately neither the\\nfrightful altar nor the opened shaft was near the vast cell-indented\\nwall which bounded the cavern area, and whose black mysterious archways\\nwould form the next goals of a logical search.\\n\\nSo Willett went back to that great pillared hall of stench and\\nanguished howling; turning down his lamp to avoid any distant glimpse\\nof the hellish altar, or of the uncovered pit with the pierced stone\\nslab beside it. Most of the black doorways led merely to small\\nchambers, some vacant and some evidently used as store rooms; and\\nin several of the latter he saw some very curious accumulations of\\nvarious objects. One was packed with rotting and dust-draped bales\\nof spare clothing, and the explorer thrilled when he saw that it was\\nunmistakably the clothing of a century and a half before. In another\\nroom he found numerous odds and ends of modern clothing, as if gradual\\nprovisions were being made to equip a large body of men. But what\\nhe disliked most of all were the huge copper vats which occasionally\\nappeared; these, and the sinister incrustations upon them. He liked\\nthem even less than the weirdly figured leaden bowls whose ruins\\nretained such obnoxious deposits and around which clung repellent odors\\nperceptible above even the general noisomeness of the crypt. When\\nhe had completed about half the entire circuit of the wall he found\\nanother corridor like that from which he had come, and out of which\\nmany doors opened.\\n\\nThis he proceeded to investigate; and after entering three rooms of\\nmedium size and of no significant contents, he came at last to a large\\noblong apartment whose businesslike tanks and tables, furnaces and\\nmodern instruments, occasional books and endless shelves of jars and\\nbottles proclaimed it indeed the long-sought laboratory of Charles\\nWardâ\\x80\\x94and no doubt of old Joseph Curwen before him.\\n\\nAfter lighting the three lamps which he found filled and ready, Dr.\\nWillett examined the place and all its appurtenances with the keenest\\ninterest; noting from the relative quantities of various reagents on\\nthe shelves that young Ward\\'s dominant concern must have been with some\\nbranch of organic chemistry. On the whole, little could be learned from\\nthe scientific ensemble, which included a gruesome-looking dissecting\\ntable; so that the room was really rather a disappointment. Among the\\nbooks was a tattered old copy of Borellus in black-letter, and it was\\nweirdly interesting to note that Ward had underlined the same passage\\nwhose marking had so perturbed good Mr. Merritt at Curwen\\'s farmhouse\\nmore than a century and a half before. That older copy, of course,\\nmust have perished along with the rest of Curwen\\'s occult library in\\nthe final raid. Three archways opened off the laboratory, and these\\nthe doctor proceeded to sample in turn. From his cursory survey he\\nsaw that two led merely to small storerooms; but these he canvassed\\nwith care, remarking the piles of coffins in various stages of damage\\nand shuddering violently at two or three of the few coffin-plates he\\ncould decipher. There was much clothing also stored in these rooms,\\nand several new and tightly-nailed boxes which he did not stop to\\ninvestigate. Most interesting of all, perhaps, were some odd bits which\\nhe judged to be fragments of old Joseph Curwen\\'s laboratory appliances.\\nThese had suffered damage at the hands of the raiders, but were still\\npartly recognizable as the chemical paraphernalia of the Georgian\\nperiod.\\n\\nThe third archway led to a very sizeable chamber entirely lined with\\nshelves and having in the center a table bearing two lamps. These\\nlamps Willett lighted, and in their brilliant glow studied the endless\\nshelving which surrounded him. Some of the upper levels were wholly\\nvacant, but most of the space was filled with small odd-looking\\nleaden jars of two general types; one tall and without handles like a\\nGrecian lekythos or oil-jug, and the other with a single handle and\\nproportioned like a Phaleron jug. All had metal stoppers, and were\\ncovered with peculiar-looking symbols moulded in low relief. In a\\nmoment the doctor noticed that these jugs were classified with great\\nrigidity; all the lekythoi being on one side of the room with a large\\nwooden sign reading \"Custodes\" above them, and all the Phalerons on\\nthe other, correspondingly labeled with a sign reading \"Materia.\" Each\\nof the jars or jugs, except some on the upper shelves that turned out\\nto be vacant, bore a cardboard tag with a number apparently referring\\nto a catalogue; and Willett resolved to look for the latter presently.\\nFor the moment, however, he was more interested in the nature of the\\narray as a whole; and experimentally opened several of the lekythoi\\nand Phalerons at random with a view to a rough generalization. The\\nresult was invariable. Both types of jar contained a small quantity\\nof a single kind of substance; a fine dusty powder of very light\\nweight and of many shades of dull neutral color. To the colors which\\nformed the only point of variation there was no apparent method of\\ndisposal; and no distinction between what occurred in the lekythoi and\\nwhat occurred in the Phalerons. A bluish-gray powder might be by the\\nside of a pinkish-white one, and any one in a Phaleron might have its\\nexact counterpart in a lekythos. The most individual feature about\\nthe powders was their non-adhesiveness. Willett would pour one into\\nhis hand, and upon returning it to its jug would find that no residue\\nwhatever remained on his palm.\\n\\nThe meaning of the two signs puzzled him, and he wondered why this\\nbattery of chemicals was separated so radically from those in glass\\njars on the shelves of the laboratory proper. \"Custodes,\" \"Materia\";\\nthat was the Latin for \"Guards\" and \"Material,\" respectivelyâ\\x80\\x94and\\nthen there came a flash of memory as to where he had seen that word\\n\"Guards\" before in connection with this dreadful mystery. It was, of\\ncourse, in the recent letter to Dr. Allen purporting to be from old\\nEdward Hutchinson; and the phrase had read: \"There was no Neede to keep\\nthe Guards in shape and eat\\'g off their Heades, and it made much to\\nbe founde in Case of Trouble, as you too welle Knowe.\" What did this\\nsignify? But waitâ\\x80\\x94was there not still another reference to \"guards\"\\nin this matter which he had failed wholly to recall when reading the\\nHutchinson letter? Back in the old non-secretive days Ward had told him\\nof the Eleazar Smith diary recording the spying of Smith and Weeden\\non the Curwen farm, and in that dreadful chronicle there had been\\na mention of conversations overheard before the old wizard betook\\nhimself wholly beneath the earth. There had been, Smith and Weeden\\ninsisted, terrible colloquies wherein figured Curwen, certain captives\\nof his, and the guards of those captives . Those guards, according to\\nHutchinson or his avatar, had \"eaten their heads off,\" so that now Dr.\\nAllen did not keep them in shape . And if not in shape , how save\\nas the \"salts\" to which it appears this wizard band was engaged in\\nreducing as many human bodies or skeletons as they could?\\n\\nSo that was what these lekythoi contained; the monstrous fruit of\\nunhallowed rites and deeds, presumably won or cowed to such submission\\nas to help when called up by some hellish incantation, in the defense\\nof their blasphemous master or the questioning of those who were not so\\nwilling? Willett shuddered at the thought of what he had been pouring\\nin and out of his hands, and for a moment felt an impulse to flee in\\npanic from that cavern of hideous shelves with their silent and perhaps\\nwatching sentinels. Then he thought of the \"Materia\"â\\x80\\x94in the myriad\\nPhaleron jugs on the other side of the room. Salts tooâ\\x80\\x94and if not the\\nsalts of \"guards,\" then the salts of what? God! Could it be possible\\nthat here lay the mortal relics of half the titan thinkers of all the\\nages; snatched by supreme ghouls from crypts where the world thought\\nthem safe, and subject to the beck and call of madmen who sought to\\ndrain their knowledge for some still wilder end whose ultimate effect\\nwould concern, as poor Charles had hinted in his frantic note, \"all\\ncivilization, all natural law, perhaps even the fate of the solar\\nsystem and the universe?\" And Marinus Bicknell Willett had sifted their\\ndust through his hands!\\n\\nThen he noticed a small door at the farther end of the room, and calmed\\nhimself enough to approach it and examine the crude sign chiseled\\nabove. It was only a symbol, but it filled him with vague spiritual\\ndread; for a morbid, dreaming friend of his had once drawn it on paper\\nand told him a few of the things it means in the dark abyss of sleep.\\nIt was the sign of Koth, that dreamers see fixed above the archway\\nof a certain black tower standing alone in twilightâ\\x80\\x94and Willett did\\nnot like what his friend Randolph Carter had said of its powers. But\\na moment later he forgot the sign as he recognized a new acrid odor\\nin the stench-filled air. This was a chemical rather than animal\\nsmell, and came clearly from the room beyond the door. And it was,\\nunmistakably, the same odor which had saturated Charles Ward\\'s clothing\\non the day the doctors had taken him away. So it was here that the\\nyouth had been interrupted by the final summons? He was wiser than old\\nJoseph Curwen, for he had not resisted. Willett, boldly determined to\\npenetrate every wonder and nightmare this nether realm might contain,\\nseized the small lamp and crossed the threshold. A wave of nameless\\nfright rolled out to meet him, but he yielded to no whim and deferred\\nto no intuition. There was nothing alive here to harm him, and he would\\nnot be stayed in his piercing of the eldritch cloud which engulfed his\\npatient.\\n\\nThe room beyond the door was of medium size, and had no furniture\\nsave a table, a single chair, and two groups of curious machines with\\nclamps and wheels which Willett recognized after a moment as medieval\\ninstruments of torture. On one side of the door stood a rack of savage\\nwhips, above which were some shelves bearing empty rows of shallow\\npedestaled cups of lead shaped like Grecian kylikes. On the other side\\nwas the table; with a powerful Argand lamp, a pad and pencil, and\\ntwo of the stoppered lekythoi from the shelves outside set down at\\nirregular places as if temporarily or in haste. Willett lighted the\\nlamp and looked carefully at the pad to see what notes young Ward\\nmight have been jotting down when interrupted; but found nothing more\\nintelligible than the following disjointed fragments in that crabbed\\nCurwen chirography, which shed no light on the case as a whole:\\n\\n\"B. dy\\'d not. Escap\\'d into walls and founde Place below.\\n\\n\"Saw olde V. saye ye Sabaoth and learnt ye Way.\\n\\n\"Rais\\'d Yog-Sothoth thrice and was ye nexte Day deliver\\'d.\\n\\n\"F. soughte to wipe out all know\\'g howe to raise Those from Outside.\"\\n\\nAs the strong Argand blaze lit up the entire chamber the doctor saw\\nthat the wall opposite the door, between the two groups of torturing\\nappliances in the corners, was covered with pegs from which hung a set\\nof shapeless looking robes of a rather dismal yellowish-white. But\\nfar more interesting were the two vacant walls, both of which were\\nthickly covered with mystic symbols and formulae roughly chiseled in\\nthe smooth dressed stone. The damp floor also bore marks of carving;\\nand with but little difficulty Willett deciphered a huge pentagram in\\nthe center, with a plain circle about three feet wide halfway between\\nthis and each corner. In one of these four circles, near where a\\nyellowish robe had been flung carelessly down, there stood a shallow\\nkylix of the sort found on the shelves above the whip-rack; and just\\noutside the periphery was one of the Phaleron jugs from the shelves in\\nthe other room, its tag numbered 118. This was unstoppered, and proved\\nupon inspection to be empty; but the explorer saw with a shiver that\\nthe kylix was not. Within its shallow area, and saved from scattering\\nonly by the absence of wind in this sequestered cavern, lay a small\\namount of a dry, dull-greenish efflorescent powder which must have\\nbelonged in the jug; and Willett almost reeled at the implications that\\ncame sweeping over him as he correlated little by little the several\\nelements and antecedents of the scene. The whips and the instruments of\\ntorture; the dust or salts from the jug of \"Materia,\" the two lekythoi\\nfrom the \"Custodes\" shelf, the robes, the formulae on the walls, the\\nnotes on the pad, the hints from letters and legends, and the thousand\\nglimpses, doubts, and suppositions which had come to torment the\\nfriends and parents of Charles Wardâ\\x80\\x94all these engulfed the doctor in a\\ntidal wave of horror as he looked at that dry greenish powder outspread\\nin the pedestalled leaden kylix on the floor.\\n\\nWith an effort, however, Willett pulled himself together and began\\nstudying the formulae chiseled on the walls. From the stained and\\nincrusted letters it was obvious that they were carved in Joseph\\nCurwen\\'s time, and their text was such as to be vaguely familiar to\\none who had read much Curwen material or delved extensively into the\\nhistory of magic. One the doctor clearly recognized as what Mrs. Ward\\nheard her son chanting on that ominous Good Friday a year before,\\nand what an authority had told him was a very terrible invocation\\naddressed to secret gods outside the normal spheres. It was not\\nspelled here exactly as Mrs. Ward had set it down from memory, nor\\nyet as the authority had shewn it to him in the forbidden pages of\\n\"Eliphas Levi\"; but its identity was unmistakable, and such words as Sabaoth , Metraton , Almonsin , and Zariatnatmik sent a shudder\\nof fright through the searcher who had seen and felt so much of cosmic\\nabomination just around the corner.\\n\\nThis was on the left-hand wall as one entered the room. The right-hand\\nwall was no less thickly inscribed, and Willett felt a start of\\nrecognition as he came upon the pair of formulae so frequently\\noccurring in the recent notes in the library. They were, roughly\\nspeaking, the same; with the ancient symbols of \"Dragon\\'s Head\" and\\n\"Dragon\\'s Tail\" heading them as in Ward\\'s scribblings. But the spelling\\ndiffered quite widely from that of the modern versions, as if old\\nCurwen had had a different way of recording sound, or as if later study\\nhad evolved more powerful and perfected variants of the invocations in\\nquestion. The doctor tried to reconcile the chiseled version with the\\none which still ran persistently in his head, and found it hard to do.\\nWhere the script he had memorized began \" Y\\'ai \\'Ng\\'ngah, Yog-Sothoth ,\"\\nthis epigraph started out as \" Aye, cngengah, Yogge-Sothotha \"; which\\nto his mind would seriously interfere with the syllabification of the\\nsecond word.\\n\\nGround as the later text was into his consciousness, the discrepancy\\ndisturbed him; and he found himself chanting the first of the formulae\\naloud in an effort to square the sound he conceived with the letters\\nhe found carved. Weird and menacing in that abyss of antique blasphemy\\nrang his voice! its accents keyed to a droning sing-song either through\\nthe spell of the past and the unknown, or through the hellish example\\nof that dull, godless wail from the pits whose inhuman cadences rose\\nand fell rhythmically in the distance through the stench and darkness.\\n\\nBut what was this cold wind which had sprung into life at the very\\noutset of the chant? The lamps were sputtering woefully, and the\\ngloom grew so dense that the letters on the wall nearly faded from\\nsight. There was smoke, too, and an acrid odor which quite drowned out\\nthe stench from the far-away wells; an odor like that he had smelt\\nbefore, yet infinitely stronger and more pungent. He turned from the\\ninscriptions to face the room with its bizarre contents, and saw\\nthat the kylix on the floor, in which the ominous efflorescent powder\\nhad lain, was giving forth a cloud of thick, greenish-black vapor of\\nsurprising volume and opacity. That powderâ\\x80\\x94Great God! it had come from\\nthe shelf of \"Materia\"â\\x80\\x94what was it doing now, and what had started it?\\nThe formula he had been chantingâ\\x80\\x94the first of the pairâ\\x80\\x94Dragon\\'s Head, ascending node â\\x80\\x94Blessed Saviour, could it beâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nThe doctor reeled, and through his head raced wildly disjointed scraps\\nfrom all he had seen, heard, and read of the frightful case of Joseph\\nCurwen and Charles Dexter Ward. \"I say to you againe, doe not call up\\nAny that you cannot put downe.... Have ye Wordes for laying at all\\ntimes readie, and stopp not to be sure when there is any Doubte of Whom you haveâ\\x80\\x94Three Talkes with What was therein inhum\\'dâ\\x80\\x94\" Mercy\\nof Heaven, what is that shape behind the parting smoke?\\n\\nMarinus Bicknell Willett has no hope that any part of his tale will\\nbe believed except by certain sympathetic friends, hence has made\\nno attempt to tell it beyond his most intimate circle. Only a few\\noutsiders have ever heard it repeated, and of these the majority laugh\\nand remark that the doctor surely is getting old. He has been advised\\nto take a long vacation and to shun future cases dealing with mental\\ndisturbance. But Mr. Ward knows that the veteran physician speaks only\\na horrible truth. Did not he himself see the noisome aperture in the\\nbungalow cellar? Did not Willett send him home overcome and ill at\\neleven o\\'clock that portentous morning? Did he not telephone the doctor\\nin vain that evening, and again the next day, and had he not driven\\nto the bungalow itself on that following noon, finding his friend\\nunconscious but unharmed on one of the beds upstairs? Willett had been\\nbreathing stertorously, and opened his eyes slowly when Mr. Ward gave\\nhim some brandy fetched from the car. Then he shuddered and screamed,\\ncrying out, \" That beardâ\\x80\\x94those eyesâ\\x80\\x94God, who are you? \" A very\\nstrange thing to say to a trim, blue-eyed, clean-shaven gentleman whom\\nhe had known from the latter\\'s boyhood.\\n\\nIn the bright noon sunlight the bungalow was unchanged since the\\nprevious morning. Willett\\'s clothing bore no disarrangement beyond\\ncertain smudges and worn places at the knees, and only a faint acrid\\nodor reminded Mr. Ward of what he had smelt on his son that day he was\\ntaken to the hospital. The doctor\\'s flashlight was missing, but his\\nvalise was safely there, as empty as when he had brought it. Before\\nindulging in any explanations, and obviously with great moral effort,\\nWillett staggered dizzily down to the cellar and tried the fateful\\nplatform before the tubs. It was unyielding. Crossing to where he had\\nleft his yet-unused tool satchel the day before, he obtained a chisel\\nand began to pry up the stubborn planks one by one. Underneath the\\nsmooth concrete was still visible, but of any opening or perforation\\nthere was no longer a trace. Nothing yawned this time to sicken the\\nmystified father who had followed the doctor downstairs; only the\\nsmooth concrete underneath the planksâ\\x80\\x94no noisome well, no world of\\nsubterrene horrors, no secret library, no Curwen papers, no nightmare\\npits of stench and howling, no laboratory or shelves or chiseled\\nformulae, noâ\\x80\\x94Dr. Willett turned pale, and clutched at the younger man.\\n\"Yesterday,\" he asked softly, \"did you see it hereâ\\x80\\x94and smell it?\" And\\nwhen Mr. Ward, himself transfixed with dread and wonder, found strength\\nto nod an affirmative, the physician gave a sound half a sigh and half\\na gasp, and nodded in turn. \"Then I will tell you,\" he said.\\n\\nSo for an hour, in the sunniest room they could find upstairs, the\\nphysician whispered his frightful tale to the wondering father. There\\nwas nothing to relate beyond the looming up of that form when the\\ngreenish-black vapor from the kylix parted, and Willett was too tired\\nto ask himself what had really occurred. There were futile, bewildered\\nhead-shakings from both men, and once Mr. Ward ventured a hushed\\nsuggestion, \"Do you suppose it would be of any use to dig?\" The doctor\\nwas silent, for it seemed hardly fitting for any human brain to answer\\nwhen powers of unknown spheres had so vitally encroached on this side\\nof the Great Abyss. Again Mr. Ward asked, \"But where did it go? It\\nbrought you here, you know, and it sealed up the hole somehow.\"\\n\\nAnd Willett again let silence answer for him.\\n\\nBut after all, this was not the final phase of the matter. Reaching for\\nhis handkerchief before rising to leave, Dr. Willett\\'s fingers closed\\nupon a piece of paper in his pocket which had not been there before,\\nand which was companioned by the candles and matches he had seized in\\nthe vanished vault. It was a common sheet, torn obviously from the\\ncheap pad in that fabulous room of horror somewhere underground, and\\nthe writing upon it was that of an ordinary lead pencilâ\\x80\\x94doubtless\\nthe one which had lain beside the pad. It was folded very carelessly,\\nand beyond the faint acrid scent of the cryptic chamber bore no print\\nor mark of any world but this. But in the text itself it did indeed\\nreek with wonder; for here was no script of any wholesome age, but the\\nlabored strokes of mediaeval darkness, scarcely legible to the laymen\\nwho now strained over it, yet having combinations of symbols which\\nseemed vaguely familiar. The briefly scrawled message was this, and its\\nmystery lent purpose to the shaken pair, who forthwith walked steadily\\nout to the Ward car and gave orders to be driven first to a quiet\\ndining place and then to the John Hay Library on the hill.\\n\\nAt the library it was easy to find good manuals of palaeography,\\nand over these the two men puzzled till the lights of evening shone\\nout from the great chandelier. In the end they found what was needed.\\nThe letters were indeed no fantastic invention, but the normal script\\nof a very dark period. They were the pointed Saxon minuscules of the\\neighth or ninth century A. D., and brought with them memories of an\\nuncouth time when under a fresh Christian veneer ancient faiths and\\nancient rites stirred stealthily, and the pale moon of Britain looked\\nsometimes on strange deeds in the Roman ruins at Caerleon and Hexhaus,\\nand by the Towers along Hadrian\\'s crumbling wall. The words were in\\nsuch Latin as a barbarous age might rememberâ\\x80\\x94\" Corvinus, necandus\\nest. Cadaver aq(ua) forti dissolvendum, nec aliq(ui)d retinendum.\\nTace ut potes. \"â\\x80\\x94which may roughly be translated, \"Curwen must be\\nkilled. The body must be dissolved in aqua fortis, nor must anything be\\nretained. Keep silence as best you are able.\"\\n\\nWillett and Mr. Ward were mute and baffled. They had met the unknown,\\nand found that they lacked emotions to respond to it as they vaguely\\nbelieved they ought. With Willett, especially, the capacity for\\nreceiving fresh impressions of awe was well-nigh exhausted; and both\\nmen sat still and helpless till the closing of the library forced them\\nto leave. Then they drove listlessly to the Ward mansion in Prospect\\nStreet, and talked to no purpose into the night. The doctor rested\\ntoward morning, but did not go home. And he was still there Sunday\\nnoon when a telephone message came from the detectives who had been\\nassigned to look up Dr. Allen.\\n\\nMr. Ward, who was pacing nervously about in a dressing-gown, answered\\nthe call in person; and told the men to come up early the next day when\\nhe heard their report was almost ready. Both Willett and he were glad\\nthat this phase of the matter was taking form, for whatever the origin\\nof the strange minuscule message, it seemed certain that the \"Curwen\"\\nwho must be destroyed could be no other than the bearded and spectacled\\nstranger. Charles had feared this man, and had said in the frantic note\\nthat he must be killed and dissolved in acid. Allen, moreover, had been\\nreceiving letters from the strange wizards in Europe under the name\\nof Curwen, and palpably regarded himself as an avatar of the bygone\\nnecromancer. And now from a fresh and unknown source had come a message\\nsaying that \"Curwen\" must be killed and dissolved in acid. The linkage\\nwas too unmistakable to be factitious; and besides, was not Allen\\nplanning to murder young Ward upon the advice of the creature called\\nHutchinson? Of course, the letter they had seen had never reached\\nthe bearded stranger; but from its text they could see that Allen\\nhad already formed plans for dealing with the youth if he grew too\\n\"squeamish.\" Without doubt, Allen must be apprehended; and even if the\\nmost drastic directions were not carried out, he must be placed where\\nhe could inflict no harm upon Charles Ward.\\n\\nThat afternoon, hoping against hope to extract some gleam of\\ninformation anent the inmost mysteries from the only available one\\ncapable of giving it, the father and the doctor went down the bay and\\ncalled on young Charles at the hospital. Simply and gravely Willett\\ntold him all he had found, and noticed how pale he turned as each\\ndescription made certain the truth of the discovery. The physician\\nemployed as much dramatic effect as he could, and watched for a\\nwincing on Charles\\' part when he approached the matter of the covered\\npits and the nameless hybrids within. But Ward did not wince. Willett\\npaused, and his voice grew indignant as he spoke of how the things were\\nstarving. He taxed the youth with shocking inhumanity, and shivered\\nwhen only a sardonic laugh came in reply. For Charles, having dropped\\nas useless his pretense that the crypt did not exist, seemed to see\\nsome ghastly jest in this affair; and chuckled hoarsely at something\\nwhich amused him. Then he whispered, in accents doubly terrible\\nbecause of the cracked voice he used, \"Damn \\'em, they do eat, but\\nthey don\\'t need to! That\\'s the rare part! A month, you say, without\\nfood? Lud, Sir, you be modest! D\\'ye know, that was the joke on poor old\\nWhipple with his virtuous bluster! Kill everything off, would he? Why,\\ndamme, he was half-deaf with the noise from Outside and never saw or\\nheard aught from the wells. He never dreamed they were there at all!\\nDevil take ye, those cursed things have been howling down there ever\\nsince Curwen was done for a hundred and fifty-seven years gone !\"\\n\\nBut no more than this could Willett get from the youth. Horrified, yet\\nalmost convinced against his will, he went on with his tale in the hope\\nthat some incident might startle his auditor out of the mad composure\\nhe maintained. Looking at the youth\\'s face, the doctor could not but\\nfeel a kind of terror at the changes which recent months had wrought.\\nTruly, the boy had drawn down nameless horrors from the skies. When the\\nroom with the formulae and the greenish dust was mentioned, Charles\\nshewed his first sign of animation. A quizzical look overspread his\\nface as he heard what Willett had read on the pad, and he ventured\\nthe mild statement that those notes were old ones, of no possible\\nsignificance to anyone not deeply initiated in the history of magic.\\n\"But,\" he added, \"had you but known the words to bring up that which I\\nhad out in the cup, you had not been here to tell me this. \\'Twas Number\\n118, and I conceive you would have shook had you looked it up in my\\nlist in t\\'other room. \\'Twas never raised by me, but I meant to have it\\nup that day you came to invite me hither.\"\\n\\nThen Willett told of the formula he had spoken and of the\\ngreenish-black smoke which had arisen; and as he did so he saw true\\nfear dawn for the first time on Charles Ward\\'s face. \"It came , and\\nyou be here alive!\" As Ward croaked the words his voice seemed almost\\nto burst free of its trammels and sink to cavernous abysses of uncanny\\nresonance. Willett, gifted with a flash of inspiration, believed he\\nsaw the situation, and wove into his reply a caution from a letter he\\nremembered. \"No. 118, you say? But don\\'t forget that stones are all\\nchanged now in nine grounds out of ten. You are never sure till you\\nquestion! \" And then, without warning, he drew forth the minuscule\\nmessage and flashed it before the patient\\'s eyes. He could have wished\\nno stronger result, for Charles Ward fainted forthwith.\\n\\nAll this conversation, of course, had been conducted with the greatest\\nsecrecy lest the resident alienists accuse the father and the physician\\nof encouraging a madman in his delusions. Unaided, too, Dr. Willett\\nand Mr. Ward picked up the stricken youth and placed him on the couch.\\nIn reviving, the patient mumbled many times of some word which he must\\nget to Orne and Hutchinson at once; so when his consciousness seemed\\nfully back the doctor told him that of those strange creatures at\\nleast one was his bitter enemy, and had given Dr. Allen advice for his\\nassassination. This revelation produced no visible effect, and before\\nit was made the visitors could see that their host had already the look\\nof a hunted man. After that he would converse no more, so Willett and\\nthe father departed presently; leaving behind a caution against the\\nbearded Allen, to which the youth only replied that this individual\\nwas very safely taken care of, and could do no one any harm even if he\\nwished.\\n\\nThis was said with an almost evil chuckle very painful to hear. They\\ndid not worry about any communications Charles might write to that\\nmonstrous pair in Europe, since they knew that the hospital authorities\\nseized all outgoing mail for censorship and would pass no wild or\\noutrÃ©-looking missive.\\n\\nThere is, however, a curious sequel to the matter of Orne and\\nHutchinson, if such indeed the exiled wizards were. Moved by some vague\\npresentiment amidst the horrors of that period, Willett arranged with\\nan international press-cutting bureau for accounts of notable current\\ncrimes and accidents in Prague and in eastern Transylvania; and after\\nsix months believed that he had found two very significant things\\namongst the multifarious items he received and had translated. One\\nwas the total wrecking of a house by night in the oldest quarter of\\nPrague, and the disappearance of the evil old man called Josef Nadeh,\\nwho had dwelt in it alone ever since anyone could remember. The other\\nwas a titan explosion in the Transylvania mountains east of Rakus, and\\nthe utter extirpation with all its inmates of the ill-regarded Castle\\nFerenczy, whose master was so badly spoken of by peasants and soldiery\\nalike that he would shortly have been summoned to Bucharest for serious\\nquestioning had not this incident cut off a career already so long as\\nto antedate all common memory. Willett maintains that the hand which\\nwrote those minuscules was able to wield stronger weapons as well; and\\nthat while Curwen was left to him to dispose of, the writer felt able\\nto find and deal with Orne and Hutchinson itself. Of what their fate\\nmay have been the doctor strives sedulously not to think.\\n\\nThe following morning Dr. Willett hastened to the Ward home to\\nbe present when the detectives arrived. Allen\\'s destruction or\\nimprisonmentâ\\x80\\x94or Curwen\\'s, if one might regard the tacit claim to\\nreincarnation as validâ\\x80\\x94he felt must be accomplished at any cost, and\\nhe communicated this conviction to Mr. Ward as they sat waiting for the\\nmen to come. They were downstairs this time, for the upper parts of the\\nhouse were beginning to be shunned because of a peculiar nauseousness\\nwhich hung indefinitely about; a nauseousness which the older servants\\nconnected with some curse left by the vanished Curwen portrait.\\n\\nAt nine o\\'clock the three detectives presented themselves and\\nimmediately delivered all that they had to say. They had not,\\nregrettably enough, located the Brava Tony Gomes as they had wished,\\nnor had they found the least trace of Dr. Allen\\'s source or present\\nwhereabouts; but they had managed to unearth a considerable number of\\nlocal impressions and facts concerning the reticent stranger. Allen\\nhad struck Pawtuxet people as a vaguely unnatural being and there was\\nan universal belief that his thick Vandyke beard was either dyed or\\nfalseâ\\x80\\x94a belief conclusively upheld by the finding of such a false\\nbeard, together with a heavy pair of dark glasses, in his room at the\\nfateful bungalow. His voice, Mr. Ward could well testify from his one\\ntelephone conversation, had a depth and hollowness that could not be\\nforgotten; and his glance seemed malign even through his smoked and\\nhorn-rimmed glasses. One shopkeeper, in the course of negotiations, had\\nseen a specimen of his handwriting and declared it was very queer and\\ncrabbed; this being confirmed by penciled notes of no clear meaning\\nfound in his room and identified by the merchant.\\n\\nIn connection with the vampirism ructions of the preceding summer, a\\nmajority of the gossips believed that Allen rather than Ward was the\\nactual vampire. Statements were also obtained from the officials who\\nhad visited the bungalow after the unpleasant incident of the motor\\ntruck robbery. They had felt less of the sinister in Dr. Allen, but had\\nrecognized him as the dominant figure in the queer shadowy cottage. The\\nplace had been too dark for them to observe him clearly, but they would\\nknow him again if they saw him. His beard had looked odd, and they\\nthought he had some slight scar above his dark spectacled right eye. As\\nfor the search of Allen\\'s room, it yielded nothing definite save the\\nbeard and glasses, and several penciled notes in a crabbed writing,\\nwhich Willett at once saw was identical with that shared by the old\\nCurwen manuscripts and by the voluminous recent notes of young Ward\\nfound in the vanished catacombs of horror.\\n\\nDr. Willett and Mr. Ward caught something of a profound, subtle, and\\ninsidious cosmic fear from this data as it was gradually unfolded,\\nand almost trembled in following up the vague, mad thought which had\\nsimultaneously reached their minds. The false beard and glasses, the\\ncrabbed Curwen penmanshipâ\\x80\\x94the old portrait and its tiny scarâ\\x80\\x94 and\\nthe altered youth in the hospital with such a scar â\\x80\\x94that deep, hollow\\nvoice on the telephoneâ\\x80\\x94was it not of this that Mr. Ward was reminded\\nwhen his son barked forth those pitiable tones to which he now claimed\\nto be reduced? Who had ever seen Charles and Allen together? Yes, some\\nofficials had once, but who later on? Was it not when Allen left that\\nCharles suddenly lost his growing fright and began to live wholly at\\nthe bungalow? Curwenâ\\x80\\x94Allenâ\\x80\\x94Wardâ\\x80\\x94in what blasphemous and abominable\\nfusion had two ages and two persons become involved? That damnable\\nresemblance of the picture to Charlesâ\\x80\\x94had it not used to stare and\\nstare, and follow the boy around the room with its eyes? Why, too, did\\nboth Allen and Charles copy Joseph Curwen\\'s handwriting, even when\\nalone and off guard? And then the frightful work of those peopleâ\\x80\\x94the\\nlost crypt of horrors that had aged the doctor overnight; the starved\\nmonsters in the noisome pits; the awful formula which had yielded such\\nnameless results; the message in minuscules found in Willett\\'s pocket;\\nthe papers and the letters and all the talk of graves and \"salts\" and\\ndiscoveriesâ\\x80\\x94whither did everything lead? In the end Mr. Ward did the\\nmost sensible thing. Steeling himself against any realization of why he\\ndid it, he gave the detectives an article to be shewn to such Pawtuxet\\nshopkeepers as had seen the portentous Dr. Allen. That article was a\\nphotograph of his luckless son, on which he now carefully drew in ink\\nthe pair of heavy glasses and the black pointed beard, which the men\\nhad brought from Allen\\'s room.\\n\\nFor two hours he waited with the doctor in the oppressive house where\\nfear and miasma were slowly gathering as the empty panel in the\\nupstairs library leered and leered and leered. Then the men returned.\\nYes, the altered photograph was a very passable likeness of Dr.\\nAllen . Mr. Ward turned pale, and Willett wiped a suddenly dampened\\nbrow with his handkerchief. Allenâ\\x80\\x94Wardâ\\x80\\x94Curwenâ\\x80\\x94it was becoming too\\nhideous for coherent thought. What had the boy called out of the void,\\nand what had it done to him? What really had happened from first to\\nlast? Who was this Allen who sought to kill Charles as too \"squeamish,\"\\nand why had his destined victim said in the postscript to that frantic\\nletter that he must be so completely obliterated in acid? Why, too,\\nhad the minuscule message, of whose origin no one dared think, said\\nthat \"Curwen\" must be likewise obliterated? What was the change ,\\nand when had the final stage occurred? That day when his frantic note\\nwas receivedâ\\x80\\x94he had been nervous all the morning, then there was an\\nalteration. He had slipped out unseen and swaggered boldly in past the\\nmen hired to guard him. That was the time, when he was out. But noâ\\x80\\x94had\\nhe not cried out in terror as he entered his studyâ\\x80\\x94this very room?\\nWhat had he found there? Or waitâ\\x80\\x94 what had found him? That simulacrum\\nwhich brushed boldly in without having been seen to goâ\\x80\\x94was that an\\nalien shadow and a horror forcing itself upon a trembling figure which\\nhad never gone out at all? Had not the butler spoken of queer noises?\\n\\nWillett rang for the man and asked him some low-toned questions. It\\nhad, surely enough, been a bad business. There had been noisesâ\\x80\\x94a cry,\\na gasp, a choking, and a sort of clattering or creaking or thumping,\\nor all of these. And Mr. Charles was not the same when he stalked out\\nwithout a word. The butler shivered as he spoke, and sniffed at the\\nheavy air that blew down from some open window upstairs. Terror had\\nsettled definitely upon the house, and only the businesslike detectives\\nfailed to imbibe a full measure of it. Even they were restless, for\\nthis case had held vague elements in the background which pleased\\nthem not at all. Dr. Willett was thinking deeply and rapidly, and his\\nthoughts were terrible ones. Now and then he would almost break into\\nmuttering as he ran over in his head a new, appalling, and increasingly\\nconclusive chain of nightmare happenings.\\n\\nThen Mr. Ward made a sign that the conference was over, and everyone\\nsave him and the doctor left the room. It was noon now, but shadows as\\nof coming night seemed to engulf the phantom-haunted mansion. Willett\\nbegan talking very seriously to his host, and urged that he leave a\\ngreat deal of the future investigation to him. There would be, he\\npredicted, certain obnoxious elements which a friend could bear better\\nthan a relative. As family physician he must have a free hand, and\\nthe first thing he required was a period alone and undisturbed in the\\nabandoned library upstairs, where the ancient overmantel had gathered\\nabout itself an aura of noisome horror more intense than when Joseph\\nCurwen\\'s features themselves glanced slyly down from the painted panel.\\n\\nMr. Ward, dazed by the flood of grotesque morbidities and unthinkably\\nmaddening suggestions that poured in upon him from every side, could\\nonly acquiesce; and half an hour later the doctor was locked in the\\nshunned room with the paneling from Olney Court. The father, listening\\noutside, heard fumbling sounds of moving and rummaging as the moments\\npassed; and finally a wrench and a creak, as if a tight cupboard door\\nwere being opened. Then there was a muffled cry, a kind of snorting\\nchoke, and a hasty slamming of whatever had been opened. Almost at\\nonce the key rattled and Willett appeared in the hall, haggard and\\nghastly, and demanding wood for the real fireplace on the south wall\\nof the room. The furnace was not enough, he said; and the electric log\\nhad little practical use. Longing yet not daring to ask questions,\\nMr. Ward gave the requisite orders and a man brought some stout pine\\nlogs, shuddering as he entered the tainted air of the library to place\\nthem in the grate. Willett meanwhile had gone up to the dismantled\\nlaboratory and brought down a few odds and ends not included in the\\nmoving of the July before. They were in a covered basket, and Mr. Ward\\nnever saw what they were.\\n\\nThen the doctor locked himself up in the library once more, and by the\\nclouds of smoke which rolled down past the windows from the chimney it\\nwas known that he had lighted the fire. Later, after a great rustling\\nof newspapers, that odd wrench and creaking were heard again; followed\\nby a thumping which none of the eavesdroppers liked. Thereafter two\\nsuppressed cries of Willett\\'s were heard, and hard upon these came a\\nswishing rustle of indefinable hatefulness. Finally the smoke that the\\nwind beat down from the chimney grew very dark and acrid, and everyone\\nwished that the weather had spared them this choking and venomous\\ninundation of peculiar fumes. Mr. Ward\\'s head reeled, and the servants\\nall clustered together in a knot to watch the horrible black smoke\\nswoop down. After an age of waiting the vapors seemed to lighten, and\\nhalf-formless sounds of scraping, sweeping, and other minor operations\\nwere heard behind the bolted door. And at last, after the slamming\\nof some cupboard within, Willett made his appearance, sad, pale and\\nhaggard, and bearing the cloth-draped basket he had taken from the\\nupstairs laboratory. He had left the window open, and into that once\\naccursed room was pouring a wealth of pure, wholesome air to mix with\\na queer new smell of disinfectants. The ancient overmantel still\\nlingered; but it seemed robbed of malignity now, and rose as calm and\\nstately in its white paneling as if it had never borne the picture of\\nJoseph Curwen. Night was coming on, yet this time its shadows held\\nno latent fright, but only a gentle melancholy. Of what he had done\\nthe doctor would never speak. To Mr. Ward he said, \"I can answer no\\nquestions, but I will say that there are different kinds of magic. I\\nhave made a great purgation. Those in this house will sleep the better\\nfor it.\"\\n\\nThat Dr. Willett\\'s \"purgation\" had been an ordeal almost as\\nnerve-racking in its way as his hideous wandering in the vanished crypt\\nis shewn by the fact that the elderly physician gave out completely\\nas soon as he reached home that evening. For three days he rested\\nconstantly in his room, though servants later muttered something\\nabout having heard him after midnight on Wednesday, when the outer\\ndoor softly opened, and closed with phenomenal softness. Servants\\'\\nimaginations, fortunately, are limited, else comment might have been\\nexcited by an item in Thursday\\'s Evening Bulletin which ran as\\nfollows:\\n\\nNorth End Ghouls Again Active\\n\\nAfter a lull of ten months since the dastardly vandalism in the Weeden\\nlot at the North Burial Ground, a nocturnal prowler was glimpsed early\\nthis morning in the same cemetery by Robert Hart, the night watchman.\\nHappening to glance for a moment from his shelter at about two a.m.,\\nHart observed a glow of a lantern or pocket torch not far to the\\nnorthward, and upon opening the door detected the figure of a man with\\na trowel very plainly silhouetted against a nearby electric light. At\\nonce starting in pursuit, he saw the figure dart hurriedly toward the\\nmain entrance, gaining the street and losing himself among the shadows\\nbefore approach or capture was possible.\\n\\nLike the first of the ghouls active during the past year, this\\nintruder had done no real damage before detection. A vacant part of\\nthe Ward lot shewed signs of a little superficial digging, but nothing\\neven nearly the size of a grave had been attempted, and no previous\\ngrave had been disturbed.\\n\\nHart, who cannot describe the prowler except as a small man probably\\nhaving a full beard, inclines to the view that all three of the\\ndigging incidents have a common source; but police from the Second\\nStation think otherwise on account of the savage nature of the second\\nincident, where an ancient coffin was removed and its headstone\\nviolently shattered.\\n\\nThe first of the incidents, in which it is thought an attempt to bury\\nsomething was frustrated, occurred a year ago last March, and has\\nbeen attributed to bootleggers seeking a cache. It is possible, says\\nSergeant Riley, that this third affair is of similar nature. Officers\\nat the Second Station are taking especial pains to capture the gang of\\nmiscreants responsible for these repeated outrages.\\n\\nAll day Thursday Dr. Willett rested as if recuperating from something\\npast or nerving himself for something to come. In the evening he wrote\\na note to Mr. Ward, which was delivered the next morning and which\\ncaused the half-dazed parent to ponder long and deeply. Mr. Ward\\nhad not been able to go down to business since the shock of Monday\\nwith its baffling reports and its sinister \"purgation,\" but he found\\nsomething calming about the doctor\\'s letter in spite of the despair it\\nseemed to promise and the fresh mysteries it seemed to evoke.\\n\\n10 Barnes St., Providence, R. I., April 12, 1928.\\n\\nDear Theodore:\\n\\nI feel that I must say a word to you before doing what I am going\\nto do tomorrow. It will conclude the terrible business we have been\\ngoing through (for I feel that no spade is ever likely to reach that\\nmonstrous place we know of), but I\\'m afraid it won\\'t set your mind at\\nrest unless I expressly assure you how very conclusive it is.\\n\\nYou have known me ever since you were a small boy, so I think you will\\nnot distrust me when I hint that some matters are best left undecided\\nand unexplored. It is better that you attempt no further speculation\\nas to Charles\\'s case, and almost imperative that you tell his mother\\nnothing more than she already suspects. When I call on you tomorrow\\nCharles will have escaped. That is all which need remain in anyone\\'s\\nmind. He was mad, and he escaped.\\n\\nSo don\\'t ask me any questions when I call. It may be that something\\nwill go wrong, but I\\'ll tell you if it does. I don\\'t think it will.\\nThere will be nothing more to worry about, for Charles will be very,\\nvery safe. He is nowâ\\x80\\x94safer than you dream. You need hold no fears\\nabout Allen, and who or what he is. He forms as much a part of the\\npast as Joseph Curwen\\'s picture, and when I ring your doorbell you\\nmay feel certain that there is no such person. And what wrote that\\nminuscule message will never trouble you or yours.\\n\\nBut you must steel yourself to melancholy, and prepare your wife to do\\nthe same. I must tell you frankly that Charles\\'s escape will not mean\\nhis restoration to you. He has been afflicted with a peculiar disease,\\nas you must realize from the subtle physical as well as mental changes\\nin him, and you must not hope to see him again. He stumbled on things\\nno mortal ought ever to know, and reached back through the years as no\\none ever should reach; and something came out of those years to engulf\\nhim.\\n\\nAnd now comes the matter in which I must ask you to trust me most of\\nall. For there will be, indeed, no uncertainty about Charles\\'s fate.\\nIn about a year, say, you can if you wish devise a suitable account of\\nthe end, for the boy will be no more. You can put up a stone in your\\nlot at the North Burial ground exactly ten feet west of your father\\'s\\nand facing the same way, and that will mark the true resting-place\\nof your son. Nor need you fear that it will mark any abnormality\\nor changeling. The ashes in that grave will be those of your own\\nunaltered bone and sinewâ\\x80\\x94of the real Charles Dexter Ward whose mind\\nyou watched from infancyâ\\x80\\x94the real Charles with the olive-mark on his\\nhip and without the black witch-mark on his chest or the pit on his\\nforehead. The Charles who never did actual evil, and who will have\\npaid with his life for his \"squeamishness.\"\\n\\nThat is all. Charles will have escaped, and a year from now you can\\nput up his stone. Do not question me tomorrow. And believe that the\\nhonour of your ancient family remains untainted now, as it has been at\\nall times in the past.\\n\\nWith profoundest sympathy, and exhortations to fortitude, calmness,\\nand resignation, I am ever\\n\\nSincerely your friend,\\n\\nMarinus B. Willett.\\n\\nSo on the morning of Friday, April 13, 1928, Marinus Bicknell Willett\\nvisited the room of Charles Dexter Ward at Dr. Waite\\'s private\\nhospital on Conanicut Island. After the interchange of a few strained\\nformalities, a new element of constraint crept in, as Ward seemed to\\nread behind the doctor\\'s masklike face a terrible purpose which had\\nnever been there before.\\n\\nWard actually turned pale, and the doctor was the first to speak.\\n\"More,\" he said, \"has been found out, and I must warn you fairly that a\\nreckoning is due.\"\\n\\n\"Digging again, and coming upon more poor starving pets?\" was the\\nironic reply. It was evident that the youth meant to shew bravado to\\nthe last.\\n\\n\"No,\" Willett slowly rejoined, \"this time I did not have to dig. We\\nhave had men looking up Dr. Allen, and they found the false beard and\\nspectacles in the bungalow!\"\\n\\n\"Excellent,\" commented the disquieted host in an effort to be wittily\\ninsulting, \"and I trust they proved more becoming than the beard and\\nglasses you now have on!\"\\n\\n\"They would become you very well,\" came the even and studied response,\\n\" as indeed they seem to have done .\"\\n\\nAs Willett said this, it almost seemed as though a cloud passed over\\nthe sun; though there was no change in the shadows on the floor. Then\\nWard ventured:\\n\\n\"And is this what asks so hotly for a reckoning? Suppose a man does\\nfind it now and then useful to be twofold?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Willett gravely, \"again you are wrong. It is no business of\\nmine if any man seeks duality; provided he has any right to exist at\\nall, and provided he does not destroy what called him out of space .\"\\n\\nWard now started violently. \"Well, Sir, what have ye found, and what\\nd\\'ye want with me?\"\\n\\nThe doctor let a little time elapse before replying, as if choosing his\\nwords for an effective answer.\\n\\n\"I have found,\" he finally intoned, \"something in a cupboard behind an\\nancient overmantel where a picture once was, and I have burned it and\\nburied the ashes where the grave of Charles Dexter Ward ought to be.\"\\n\\nThe madman choked and sprang from the chair in which he had been\\nsitting:\\n\\n\"Damn ye, who did ye tellâ\\x80\\x94and who\\'ll believe it was he after these\\nfull two months, with me alive? What d\\'ye mean to do?\"\\n\\nWillett, though a small man, actually took on a kind of judicial\\nmajesty as he calmed the patient with a gesture.\\n\\n\"I have told no one. This is no common caseâ\\x80\\x94it is a madness out of\\ntime and a horror from beyond the spheres which no police or lawyers\\nor courts or alienists could ever fathom or grapple with. You cannot\\ndeceive me, Joseph Curwen, for I know that your accursed magic is true!\\n\\n\"I know how you wove the spell that brooded outside the years and\\nfastened on your double and descendant; I know how you drew him into\\nthe past and got him to raise you up from your detestable grave; I\\nknow how he kept you hidden in his laboratory while you studied modern\\nthings and roved abroad as a vampire by night, and how you later\\nshewed yourself in beard and glasses that no one might wonder at your\\ngodless likeness to him; I know what you resolved to do when he balked\\nat your monstrous rifling of the world\\'s tombs, and at what you\\nplanned afterward , and I know how you did it.\\n\\n\"You left off your beard and glasses and fooled the guards around\\nthe house. They thought it was he who went in, and they thought it\\nwas he who came out when you had strangled and hidden him. But you\\nhadn\\'t reckoned on the different contacts of two minds. You were a\\nfool, Curwen, to fancy that a mere visual identity would be enough.\\nWhy didn\\'t you think of the speech and the voice and the handwriting?\\nIt hasn\\'t worked, you see, after all. You know better than I who or\\nwhat wrote that message in minuscules, but I will warn you it was not\\nwritten in vain. There are abominations and blasphemies which must be\\nstamped out, and I believe that the writer of those words will attend\\nto Orne and Hutchinson. One of those creatures wrote you once, \\'do not\\ncall up any that you cannot put down.\\' Curwen, a man can\\'t tamper with\\nNature beyond certain limits, and every horror you have woven will rise\\nup to wipe you out.\"\\n\\nBut here the doctor was cut short by a convulsive cry from the creature\\nbefore him. Hopelessly at bay, weaponless, and knowing that any show\\nof physical violence would bring a score of attendants to the doctor\\'s\\nrescue, Joseph Curwen had recourse to his one ancient ally, and began a\\nseries of cabalistic motions with his forefingers as his deep, hollow\\nvoice, now unconcealed by feigned hoarseness, bellowed out the opening\\nwords of a terrible formula.\\n\\n\"PER ADONAI ELOIM, ADONAI JEHOVA, ADONAI SABAOTH, METRATON....\"\\n\\nBut Willett was too quick for him. Even as the dogs in the yard outside\\nbegan to howl, and even as a chill wind sprang suddenly up from the\\nbay, the doctor commenced the solemn and measured intonation of that\\nwhich he had meant all along to recite. An eye for an eyeâ\\x80\\x94magic for\\nmagicâ\\x80\\x94let the outcome shew how well the lesson of the abyss had\\nbeen learned! So in a clear voice Marinus Bicknell Willett began the second of that pair of formulae whose first had raised the writer of\\nthose minusculesâ\\x80\\x94the cryptic invocation whose heading was the Dragon\\'s\\nTail, sign of the descending nodeâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nAt the very first word from Willett\\'s mouth the previously commenced\\nformula of the patient stopped short. Unable to speak, the monster\\nmade wild motions with his arms until they too were arrested. When the\\nawful name of Yog-Sothoth was uttered, the hideous change began.\\nIt was not merely a dissolution , but rather a transformation or recapitulation ; and Willett shut his eyes lest he faint before the\\nrest of the incantation could be pronounced.\\n\\nBut he did not faint, and that man of unholy centuries and forbidden\\nsecrets never troubled the world again. The madness out of time had\\nsubsided, and the case of Charles Dexter Ward was closed. Opening his\\neyes before staggering out of that room of horror, Dr. Willett saw that\\nwhat he had kept in memory had not been kept amiss. There had, as he\\nhad predicted, been no need for acids. For like his accursed picture\\na year before, Joseph Curwen now lay scattered on the floor as a thin\\ncoating of fine bluish-gray dust.',\n",

LOVECRAFT\\n\\nA posthumous story of immense power, written by a master of weird\\nfictionâ\\x80\\x94a tale of a revolting horror in the cellar of an old\\nhouse in New England\\n\\nFrom even the greatest of horrors\\nirony is seldom absent. Sometimes\\nit enters directly into the composition\\nof the events, while sometimes it\\nrelates only to their fortuitous position\\namong persons and places. The latter\\nsort is splendidly exemplified by a case\\nin the ancient city of Providence, where\\nin the late forties Edgar Allan Poe used\\nto sojourn often during his unsuccessful\\nwooing of the gifted poetess, Mrs. Whitman.\\nPoe generally stopped at the Mansion\\nHouse in Benefit Streetâ\\x80\\x94the renamed\\nGolden Ball Inn whose roof has\\nsheltered Washington, Jefferson, and\\nLafayetteâ\\x80\\x94and his favorite walk led\\nnorthward along the same street to Mrs.\\nWhitman\\'s home and the neighboring\\nhillside churchyard of St. John\\'s, whose\\nhidden expanse of Eighteenth Century\\ngravestones had for him a peculiar fascination.\\n\\nNow the irony is this. In this walk, so\\nmany times repeated, the world\\'s greatest\\nmaster of the terrible and the bizarre\\nwas obliged to pass a particular house\\non the eastern side of the street; a dingy,\\nantiquated structure perched on the\\nabruptly rising side hill, with a great\\nunkempt yard dating from a time when\\nthe region was partly open country. It\\ndoes not appear that he ever wrote or\\nspoke of it, nor is there any evidence\\nthat he even noticed it. And yet that\\nhouse, to the two persons in possession\\nof certain information, equals or outranks\\nin horror the wildest fantasy of the\\ngenius who so often passed it unknowingly,\\nand stands starkly leering as a\\nsymbol of all that is unutterably hideous.\\n\\nThe house wasâ\\x80\\x94and for that matter\\nstill isâ\\x80\\x94of a kind to attract the attention\\nof the curious. Originally a farm or semi-farm\\nbuilding, it followed the average\\nNew England colonial lines of the middle\\nEighteenth Centuryâ\\x80\\x94the prosperous\\npeaked-roof sort, with two stories and\\ndormerless attic, and with the Georgian\\ndoorway and interior panelling dictated\\nby the progress of taste at that time. It\\nfaced south, with one gable end buried\\nto the lower windows in the eastward\\nrising hill, and the other exposed to the\\nfoundations toward the street. Its construction,\\nover a century and a half ago,\\nhad followed the grading and straightening\\nof the road in that especial vicinity;\\nfor Benefit Streetâ\\x80\\x94at first called Back\\nStreetâ\\x80\\x94was laid out as a lane winding\\namongst the graveyards of the first settlers,\\nand straightened only when the\\nremoval of the bodies to the North Burial\\nGround made it decently possible to cut\\nthrough the old family plots.\\n\\nAt the start, the western wall had lain\\nsome twenty feet up a precipitous lawn\\nfrom the roadway; but a widening of the\\nstreet at about the time of the Revolution\\nsheared off most of the intervening space,\\nexposing the foundations so that a brick\\nbasement wall had to be made, giving\\nthe deep cellar a street frontage with door\\nand one window above ground, close to\\nthe new line of public travel. When\\nthe sidewalk was laid out a century ago\\nthe last of the intervening space was\\nremoved; and Poe in his walks must\\nhave seen only a sheer ascent of dull gray\\nbrick flush with the sidewalk and surmounted\\nat a height of ten feet by the\\nantique shingled bulk of the house\\nproper.\\n\\nThe farm-like ground extended back\\nvery deeply up the hill, almost to\\nWheaton Street. The space south of the\\nhouse, abutting on Benefit Street, was of\\ncourse greatly above the existing sidewalk\\nlevel, forming a terrace bounded by\\na high bank wall of damp, mossy stone\\npierced by a steep flight of narrow steps\\nwhich led inward between canyon-like\\nsurfaces to the upper region of mangy\\nlawn, rheumy brick walks, and neglected\\ngardens whose dismantled cement urns,\\nrusted kettles fallen from tripods of\\nknotty sticks, and similar paraphernalia\\nset off the weather-beaten front door with\\nits broken fanlight, rotting Ionic pilasters,\\nand wormy triangular pediment.\\n\\nWhat I heard in my youth about\\nthe shunned house was merely that\\npeople died there in alarmingly great\\nnumbers. That, I was told, was why the\\noriginal owners had moved out some\\ntwenty years after building the place. It\\nwas plainly unhealthy, perhaps because\\nof the dampness and fungous growths in\\nthe cellar, the general sickish smell, the\\ndrafts of the hallways, or the quality of\\nthe well and pump water. These things\\nwere bad enough, and these were all that\\ngained belief among the persons whom\\nI knew. Only the notebooks of my antiquarian\\nuncle, Doctor Elihu Whipple, revealed\\nto me at length the darker, vaguer\\nsurmises which formed an undercurrent\\nof folklore among old-time servants and\\nhumble folk; surmises which never travelled\\nfar, and which were largely forgotten\\nwhen Providence grew to be a\\nmetropolis with a shifting modern population.\\n\\nThe general fact is, that the house was\\nnever regarded by the solid part of the\\ncommunity as in any real sense \"haunted.\"\\nThere were no widespread tales of rattling\\nchains, cold currents of air, extinguished\\nlights, or faces at the window. Extremists\\nsometimes said the house was \"unlucky,\"\\nbut that is as far as even they\\nwent. What was really beyond dispute\\nis that a frightful proportion of persons\\ndied there; or more accurately, had died\\nthere, since after some peculiar happenings\\nover sixty years ago the building\\nhad become deserted through the sheer\\nimpossibility of renting it. These persons\\nwere not all cut off suddenly by any one\\ncause; rather did it seem that their vitality\\nwas insidiously sapped, so that each one\\ndied the sooner from whatever tendency\\nto weakness he may have naturally had.\\nAnd those who did not die displayed in\\nvarying degree a type of anemia or consumption,\\nand sometimes a decline of the\\nmental faculties, which spoke ill for the\\nsalubriousness of the building. Neighboring\\nhouses, it must be added, seemed\\nentirely free from the noxious quality.\\n\\nThis much I knew before my insistent\\nquestioning led my uncle to show me the\\nnotes which finally embarked us both on\\nour hideous investigation. In my childhood\\nthe shunned house was vacant, with\\nbarren, gnarled and terrible old trees,\\nlong, queerly pale grass and nightmarishly\\nmisshapen weeds in the high terraced\\nyard where birds never lingered. We\\nboys used to overrun the place, and I can\\nstill recall my youthful terror not only at\\nthe morbid strangeness of this sinister\\nvegetation, but at the eldritch atmosphere\\nand odor of the dilapidated house, whose\\nunlocked front door was often entered in\\nquest of shudders. The small-paned windows\\nwere largely broken, and a nameless\\nair of desolation hung round the\\nprecarious panelling, shaky interior shutters,\\npeeling wall-paper, falling plaster,\\nrickety staircases, and such fragments of\\nbattered furniture as still remained. The\\ndust and cobwebs added their touch of\\nthe fearful; and brave indeed was the\\nboy who would voluntarily ascend the\\nladder to the attic, a vast raftered length\\nlighted only by small blinking windows\\nin the gable ends, and filled with a\\nmassed wreckage of chests, chairs, and\\nspinning-wheels which infinite years of\\ndeposit had shrouded and festooned into\\nmonstrous and hellish shapes.\\n\\nBut after all, the attic was not the\\nmost terrible part of the house. It was\\nthe dank, humid cellar which somehow\\nexerted the strongest repulsion on us,\\neven though it was wholly above ground\\non the street side, with only a thin door\\nand window-pierced brick wall to separate\\nit from the busy sidewalk. We\\nscarcely knew whether to haunt it in\\nspectral fascination, or to shun it for\\nthe sake of our souls and our sanity. For\\none thing, the bad odor of the house\\nwas strongest there; and for another\\nthing, we did not like the white fungous\\ngrowths which occasionally sprang up in\\nrainy summer weather from the hard\\nearth floor. Those fungi, grotesquely like\\nthe vegetation in the yard outside, were\\ntruly horrible in their outlines; detestable\\nparodies of toadstools and Indian-pipes,\\nwhose like we had never seen in any other\\nsituation. They rotted quickly, and at one\\nstage became slightly phosphorescent; so\\nthat nocturnal passers-by sometimes spoke\\nof witch-fires glowing behind the broken\\npanes of the fetor-spreading windows.\\n\\nWe neverâ\\x80\\x94even in our wildest Halloween\\nmoodsâ\\x80\\x94visited this cellar by\\nnight, but in some of our daytime visits\\ncould detect the phosphorescence, especially\\nwhen the day was dark and wet.\\nThere was also a subtler thing we often\\nthought we detectedâ\\x80\\x94a very strange\\nthing which was, however, merely suggestive\\nat most. I refer to a sort of\\ncloudy whitish pattern on the dirt floorâ\\x80\\x94a\\nvague, shifting deposit of mold or niter\\nwhich we sometimes thought we could\\ntrace amidst the sparse fungous growths\\nnear the huge fireplace of the basement\\nkitchen. Once in a while it struck us\\nthat this patch bore an uncanny resemblance\\nto a doubled-up human figure,\\nthough generally no such kinship existed,\\nand often there was no whitish deposit\\nwhatever.\\n\\nOn a certain rainy afternoon when this\\nillusion seemed phenomenally strong, and\\nwhen, in addition, I had fancied I\\nglimpsed a kind of thin, yellowish, shimmering\\nexhalation rising from the nitrous\\npattern toward the yawning fireplace,\\nI spoke to my uncle about the\\nmatter. He smiled at this odd conceit,\\nbut it seemed that his smile was tinged\\nwith reminiscence. Later I heard that a\\nsimilar notion entered into some of the\\nwild ancient tales of the common folkâ\\x80\\x94a\\nnotion likewise alluding to ghoulish,\\nwolfish shapes taken by smoke from the\\ngreat chimney, and queer contours assumed\\nby certain of the sinuous tree-roots\\nthat thrust their way into the cellar\\nthrough the loose foundation-stones.\\n\\n2\\n\\nNot till my adult years did my uncle\\nset before me the notes and data\\nwhich he had collected concerning the\\nshunned house. Doctor Whipple was a\\nsane, conservative physician of the old\\nschool, and for all his interest in the\\nplace was not eager to encourage young\\nthoughts toward the abnormal. His own\\nview, postulating simply a building and\\nlocation of markedly unsanitary qualities,\\nhad nothing to do with abnormality;\\nbut he realized that the very picturesqueness\\nwhich aroused his own interest would\\nin a boy\\'s fanciful mind take on all manner\\nof gruesome imaginative associations.\\n\\nThe doctor was a bachelor; a white-haired,\\nclean-shaven, old-fashioned gentleman,\\nand a local historian of note, who\\nhad often broken a lance with such controversial\\nguardians of tradition as Sidney\\nS. Rider and Thomas W. Bicknell. He\\nlived with one man-servant in a Georgian\\nhomestead with knocker and iron-railed\\nsteps, balanced eerily on the steep ascent\\nof North Court Street beside the ancient\\nbrick court and colony house where his\\ngrandfatherâ\\x80\\x94a cousin of that celebrated\\nprivateersman, Captain Whipple, who\\nburnt His Majesty\\'s armed schooner Gaspee in 1772â\\x80\\x94had voted in the legislature\\non May 4, 1776, for the independence\\nof the Rhode Island Colony.\\nAround him in the damp, low-ceiled library\\nwith the musty white panelling,\\nheavy carved overmantel and small-paned,\\nvine-shaded windows, were the relics and\\nrecords of his ancient family, among\\nwhich were many dubious allusions to the\\nshunned house in Benefit Street. That\\npest spot lies not far distantâ\\x80\\x94for Benefit\\nruns ledgewise just above the court\\nhouse along the precipitous hill up which\\nthe first settlement climbed.\\n\\nWhen, in the end, my insistent pestering\\nand maturing years evoked from my\\nuncle the hoarded lore I sought, there lay\\nbefore me a strange enough chronicle.\\nLong-winded, statistical, and drearily\\ngenealogical as some of the matter was,\\nthere ran through it a continuous thread\\nof brooding, tenacious horror and preternatural\\nmalevolence which impressed\\nme even more than it had impressed the\\ngood doctor. Separate events fitted together\\nuncannily, and seemingly irrelevant\\ndetails held mines of hideous possibilities.\\nA new and burning curiosity\\ngrew in me, compared to which my boyish\\ncuriosity was feeble and inchoate.\\n\\nThe first revelation led to an exhaustive\\nresearch, and finally to that shuddering\\nquest which proved so disastrous to myself\\nand mine. For at the last my uncle\\ninsisted on joining the search I had\\ncommenced, and after a certain night in\\nthat house he did not come away with\\nme. I am lonely without that gentle soul\\nwhose long years were filled only with\\nhonor, virtue, good taste, benevolence,\\nand learning. I have reared a marble urn\\nto his memory in St. John\\'s churchyardâ\\x80\\x94the\\nplace that Poe lovedâ\\x80\\x94the hidden\\ngrove of giant willows on the hill, where\\ntombs and headstones huddle quietly between\\nthe hoary bulk of the church and\\nthe houses and bank walls of Benefit\\nStreet.\\n\\nThe history of the house, opening\\namidst a maze of dates, revealed no trace\\nof the sinister either about its construction\\nor about the prosperous and honorable\\nfamily who built it. Yet from the first\\na taint of calamity, soon increased to\\nboding significance, was apparent. My\\nuncle\\'s carefully compiled record began\\nwith the building of the structure in\\n1763, and followed the theme with an\\nunusual amount of detail. The shunned\\nhouse, it seems, was first inhabited by\\nWilliam Harris and his wife Rhoby Dexter,\\nwith their children, Elkanah, born\\nin 1755, Abigail, born in 1757, William,\\nJr., born in 1759, and Ruth, born in\\n1761. Harris was a substantial merchant\\nand seaman in the West India trade, connected\\nwith the firm of Obadiah Brown\\nand his nephews. After Brown\\'s death\\nin 1761, the new firm of Nicholas Brown\\n& Company made him master of the brig Prudence , Providence-built, of 120 tons,\\nthus enabling him to erect the new homestead\\nhe had desired ever since his marriage.\\n\\nThe site he had chosenâ\\x80\\x94a recently\\nstraightened part of the new and fashionable\\nBack Street, which ran along the\\nside of the hill above crowded Cheapsideâ\\x80\\x94was\\nall that could be wished, and\\nthe building did justice to the location.\\nIt was the best that moderate means\\ncould afford, and Harris hastened to\\nmove in before the birth of a fifth child\\nwhich the family expected. That child,\\na boy, came in December; but was still-born.\\nNor was any child to be born alive\\nin that house for a century and a half.\\n\\nThe next April, sickness occurred\\namong the children, and Abigail and\\nRuth died before the month was over.\\nDoctor Job Ives diagnosed the trouble as\\nsome infantile fever, though others declared\\nit was more of a mere wasting-away\\nor decline. It seemed, in any event,\\nto be contagious; for Hannah Bowen, one\\nof the two servants, died of it in the following\\nJune. Eli Lideason, the other servant,\\nconstantly complained of weakness;\\nand would have returned to his father\\'s\\nfarm in Rehoboth but for a sudden attachment\\nfor Mehitabel Pierce, who was\\nhired to succeed Hannah. He died the\\nnext yearâ\\x80\\x94a sad year indeed, since it\\nmarked the death of William Harris himself,\\nenfeebled as he was by the climate\\nof Martinique, where his occupation had\\nkept him for considerable periods during\\nthe preceding decade.\\n\\nThe widowed Rhoby Harris never recovered\\nfrom the shock of her husband\\'s\\ndeath, and the passing of her first-born\\nElkanah two years later was the final\\nblow to her reason. In 1768 she fell victim\\nto a mild form of insanity, and was\\nthereafter confined to the upper part of\\nthe house; her elder maiden sister, Mercy\\nDexter, having moved in to take charge\\nof the family. Mercy was a plain, raw-boned\\nwoman of great strength; but her\\nhealth visibly declined from the time of\\nher advent. She was greatly devoted to\\nher unfortunate sister, and had an especial\\naffection for her only surviving nephew\\nWilliam, who from a sturdy infant had\\nbecome a sickly, spindling lad. In this\\nyear the servant Mehitabel died, and the\\nother servant, Preserved Smith, left without\\ncoherent explanationâ\\x80\\x94or at least,\\nwith only some wild tales and a complaint\\nthat he disliked the smell of the\\nplace. For a time Mercy could secure no\\nmore help, since the seven deaths and\\ncase of madness, all occurring within five\\nyears\\' space, had begun to set in motion\\nthe body of fireside rumor which later became\\nso bizarre. Ultimately, however, she\\nobtained new servants from out of town;\\nAnn White, a morose woman from that\\npart of North Kingstown now set off as\\nthe township of Exeter, and a capable\\nBoston man named Zenas Low.\\n\\nIt was Ann White who first gave definite\\nshape to the sinister idle talk.\\nMercy should have known better than to\\nhire anyone from the Nooseneck Hill\\ncountry, for that remote bit of backwoods\\nwas then, as now, a seat of the most uncomfortable\\nsuperstitions. As lately as\\n1892 an Exeter community exhumed a\\ndead body and ceremoniously burnt its\\nheart in order to prevent certain alleged\\nvisitations injurious to the public health\\nand peace, and one may imagine the\\npoint of view of the same section in\\n1768. Ann\\'s tongue was perniciously active,\\nand within a few months Mercy\\ndischarged her, filling her place with a\\nfaithful and amiable Amazon from Newport,\\nMaria Robbins.\\n\\nMeanwhile poor Rhoby Harris, in her\\nmadness, gave voice to dreams and\\nimaginings of the most hideous sort. At\\ntimes her screams became insupportable,\\nand for long periods she would utter\\nshrieking horrors which necessitated her\\nson\\'s temporary residence with his cousin,\\nPeleg Harris, in Presbyterian Lane near\\nthe new college building. The boy would\\nseem to improve after these visits, and had\\nMercy been as wise as she was well-meaning,\\nshe would have let him live permanently\\nwith Peleg. Just what Mrs. Harris\\ncried out in her fits of violence, tradition\\nhesitates to say; or rather, presents such\\nextravagant accounts that they nullify\\nthemselves through sheer absurdity. Certainly\\nit sounds absurd to hear that a\\nwoman educated only in the rudiments\\nof French often shouted for hours in a\\ncoarse and idiomatic form of that language,\\nor that the same person, alone and\\nguarded, complained wildly of a staring\\nthing which bit and chewed at her. In\\n1772 the servant Zenas died, and when\\nMrs. Harris heard of it she laughed with\\na shocking delight utterly foreign to her.\\nThe next year she herself died, and was\\nlaid to rest in the North Burial Ground\\nbeside her husband.\\n\\nUpon the outbreak of trouble with\\nGreat Britain in 1775, William Harris,\\ndespite his scant sixteen years and feeble\\nconstitution, managed to enlist in the\\nArmy of Observation under General\\nGreene; and from that time on enjoyed a\\nsteady rise in health and prestige. In\\n1780, as a captain in the Rhode Island\\nforces in New Jersey under Colonel\\nAngell, he met and married Phebe Hetfield\\nof Elizabethtown, whom he brought\\nto Providence upon his honorable discharge\\nin the following year.\\n\\nThe young soldier\\'s return was not a\\nthing of unmitigated happiness. The\\nhouse, it is true, was still in good condition;\\nand the street had been widened\\nand changed in name from Back Street\\nto Benefit Street. But Mercy Dexter\\'s\\nonce robust frame had undergone a sad\\nand curious decay, so that she was now a\\nstooped and pathetic figure with hollow\\nvoice and disconcerting pallorâ\\x80\\x94qualities\\nshared to a singular degree by the one\\nremaining servant Maria. In the autumn\\nof 1782 Phebe Harris gave birth to a\\nstill-born daughter, and on the fifteenth\\nof the next May Mercy Dexter took leave\\nof a useful, austere, and virtuous life.\\n\\nWilliam Harris, at last thoroughly convinced\\nof the radically unhealthful nature\\nof his abode, now took steps toward\\nquitting it and closing it for ever. Securing\\ntemporary quarters for himself and\\nhis wife at the newly opened Golden Ball\\nInn, he arranged for the building of a\\nnew and finer house in Westminster\\nStreet, in the growing part of the town\\nacross the Great Bridge. There, in 1785,\\nhis son Dutee was born; and there the\\nfamily dwelt till the encroachments of\\ncommerce drove them back across the\\nriver and over the hill to Angell Street,\\nin the newer East Side residence district,\\nwhere the late Archer Harris built his\\nsumptuous but hideous French-roofed\\nmansion in 1876. William and Phebe\\nboth succumbed to the yellow fever epidemic\\nof 1797, but Dutee was brought up\\nby his cousin Rathbone Harris, Peleg\\'s\\nson.\\n\\nRathbone was a practical man, and\\nrented the Benefit Street house despite\\nWilliam\\'s wish to keep it vacant. He\\nconsidered it an obligation to his ward to\\nmake the most of all the boy\\'s property,\\nnor did he concern himself with the\\ndeaths and illnesses which caused so\\nmany changes of tenants, or the steadily\\ngrowing aversion with which the house\\nwas generally regarded. It is likely that he\\nfelt only vexation when, in 1804, the\\ntown council ordered him to fumigate the\\nplace with sulfur, tar, and gum camphor\\non account of the much-discussed deaths\\nof four persons, presumably caused by\\nthe then diminishing fever epidemic.\\nThey said the place had a febrile smell.\\n\\nDutee himself thought little of the\\nhouse, for he grew up to be a privateersman,\\nand served with distinction on the Vigilant under Captain Cahoone in the\\nWar of 1812. He returned unharmed,\\nmarried in 1814, and became a father on\\nthat memorable night of September 23,\\n1815, when a great gale drove the waters\\nof the bay over half the town, and floated\\na tall sloop well up Westminster Street\\nso that its masts almost tapped the Harris\\nwindows in symbolic affirmation that the\\nnew boy, Welcome, was a seaman\\'s son.\\n\\nWelcome did not survive his father,\\nbut lived to perish gloriously at Fredericksburg\\nin 1862. Neither he nor his\\nson Archer knew of the shunned house\\nas other than a nuisance almost impossible\\nto rentâ\\x80\\x94perhaps on account of the\\nmustiness and sickly odor of unkempt\\nold age. Indeed, it never was rented after\\na series of deaths culminating in 1861,\\nwhich the excitement of the war tended\\nto throw into obscurity. Carrington Harris,\\nlast of the male line, knew it only as\\na deserted and somewhat picturesque\\ncenter of legend until I told him my experience.\\nHe had meant to tear it down\\nand build an apartment house on the site,\\nbut after my account decided to let it\\nstand, install plumbing, and rent it. Nor\\nhas he yet had any difficulty in obtaining\\ntenants. The horror has gone.\\n\\n3\\n\\nIt may well be imagined how powerfully\\nI was affected by the annals of\\nthe Harrises. In this continuous record\\nthere seemed to me to brood a persistent\\nevil beyond anything in nature as I had\\nknown it; an evil clearly connected with\\nthe house and not with the family. This\\nimpression was confirmed by my uncle\\'s\\nless systematic array of miscellaneous dataâ\\x80\\x94legends\\ntranscribed from servant gossip,\\ncuttings from the papers, copies of\\ndeath certificates by fellow-physicians,\\nand the like. All of this material I cannot\\nhope to give, for my uncle was a tireless\\nantiquarian and very deeply interested in\\nthe shunned house; but I may refer to\\nseveral dominant points which earn notice\\nby their recurrence through many reports\\nfrom diverse sources. For example, the\\nservant gossip was practically unanimous\\nin attributing to the fungous and malodorous cellar of the house a vast supremacy\\nin evil influence. There had been\\nservantsâ\\x80\\x94Ann White especiallyâ\\x80\\x94who\\nwould not use the cellar kitchen, and at\\nleast three well-defined legends bore\\nupon the queer quasi-human or diabolic\\noutlines assumed by tree-roots and\\npatches of mold in that region. These\\nlatter narratives interested me profoundly,\\non account of what I had seen in my boyhood,\\nbut I felt that most of the significance\\nhad in each case been largely obscured\\nby additions from the common\\nstock of local ghost lore.\\n\\nAnn White, with her Exeter superstition,\\nhad promulgated the most extravagant\\nand at the same time most consistent\\ntale; alleging that there must lie buried\\nbeneath the house one of those vampiresâ\\x80\\x94the\\ndead who retain their bodily form\\nand live on the blood or breath of the\\nlivingâ\\x80\\x94whose hideous legions send their\\npreying shapes or spirits abroad by night.\\nTo destroy a vampire one must, the\\ngrandmothers say, exhume it and burn its\\nheart, or at least drive a stake through\\nthat organ; and Ann\\'s dogged insistence\\non a search under the cellar had been\\nprominent in bringing about her discharge.\\n\\nHer tales, however, commanded a wide\\naudience, and were the more readily accepted\\nbecause the house indeed stood on\\nland once used for burial purposes. To\\nme their interest depended less on this\\ncircumstance than on the peculiarly appropriate\\nway in which they dovetailed\\nwith certain other thingsâ\\x80\\x94the complaint\\nof the departing servant Preserved Smith,\\nwho had preceded Ann and never heard\\nof her, that something \"sucked his\\nbreath\" at night; the death-certificates of\\nthe fever victims of 1804, issued by\\nDoctor Chad Hopkins, and showing the\\nfour deceased persons all unaccountably\\nlacking in blood; and the obscure passages\\nof poor Rhoby Harris\\'s ravings,\\nwhere she complained of the sharp teeth\\nof a glassy-eyed, half-visible presence.\\n\\nFree from unwarranted superstition\\nthough I am, these things produced in\\nme an odd sensation, which was intensified\\nby a pair of widely separated newspaper\\ncuttings relating to deaths in the\\nshunned houseâ\\x80\\x94one from the Providence\\nGazette and Country-Journal of April\\n12, 1815, and the other from the Daily\\nTranscript and Chronicle of October 27,\\n1845â\\x80\\x94each of which detailed an appallingly\\ngrisly circumstance whose duplication\\nwas remarkable. It seems that in\\nboth instances the dying person, in 1815\\na gentle old lady named Stafford and in\\n1845 a schoolteacher of middle age\\nnamed Eleazar Durfee, became transfigured\\nin a horrible way, glaring glassily\\nand attempting to bite the throat of the\\nattending physician. Even more puzzling,\\nthough, was the final case which put an\\nend to the renting of the houseâ\\x80\\x94a series\\nof anemia deaths preceded by progressive\\nmadnesses wherein the patient would\\ncraftily attempt the lives of his relatives\\nby incisions in the neck or wrist.\\n\\nThis was in 1860 and 1861, when my\\nuncle had just begun his medical practise;\\nand before leaving for the front he\\nheard much of it from his elder professional\\ncolleagues. The really inexplicable\\nthing was the way in which the victimsâ\\x80\\x94ignorant\\npeople, for the ill-smelling and\\nwidely shunned house could now be\\nrented to no othersâ\\x80\\x94would babble\\nmaledictions in French, a language they\\ncould not possibly have studied to any\\nextent. It made one think of poor Rhoby\\nHarris nearly a century before, and so\\nmoved my uncle that he commenced collecting\\nhistorical data on the house after\\nlistening, some time subsequent to his\\nreturn from the war, to the first-hand account\\nof Doctors Chase and Whitmarsh.\\nIndeed, I could see that my uncle had\\nthought deeply on the subject, and that\\nhe was glad of my own interestâ\\x80\\x94an\\nopen-minded and sympathetic interest\\nwhich enabled him to discuss with me\\nmatters at which others would merely\\nhave laughed. His fancy had not gone so\\nfar as mine, but he felt that the place was\\nrare in its imaginative potentialities, and\\nworthy of note as an inspiration in the\\nfield of the grotesque and macabre.\\n\\nFor my part, I was disposed to take the\\nwhole subject with profound seriousness,\\nand began at once not only to review the\\nevidence, but to accumulate as much\\nmore as I could. I talked with the elderly\\nArcher Harris, then owner of the house,\\nmany times before his death in 1916; and\\nobtained from him and his still surviving\\nmaiden sister Alice an authentic corroboration\\nof all the family data my uncle\\nhad collected. When, however, I asked\\nthem what connection with France or its\\nlanguage the house could have, they confessed\\nthemselves as frankly baffled and\\nignorant as I. Archer knew nothing, and\\nall that Miss Harris could say was that\\nan old allusion her grandfather, Dutee\\nHarris, had heard of might have shed a\\nlittle light. The old seaman, who had\\nsurvived his son Welcome\\'s death in battle\\nby two years, had not himself known\\nthe legend, but recalled that his earliest\\nnurse, the ancient Maria Robbins, seemed\\ndarkly aware of something that might\\nhave lent a weird significance to the\\nFrench raving of Rhoby Harris, which\\nshe had so often heard during the last\\ndays of that hapless woman. Maria had\\nbeen at the shunned house from 1769 till\\nthe removal of the family in 1783, and\\nhad seen Mercy Dexter die. Once she\\nhinted to the child Dutee of a somewhat\\npeculiar circumstance in Mercy\\'s last\\nmoments, but he had soon forgotten all\\nabout it save that it was something peculiar.\\nThe granddaughter, moreover, recalled\\neven this much with difficulty. She\\nand her brother were not so much interested\\nin the house as was Archer\\'s\\nson Carrington, the present owner, with\\nwhom I talked after my experience.\\n\\nHaving exhausted the Harris family\\nof all the information it could furnish,\\nI turned my attention to early town\\nrecords and deeds with a zeal more penetrating\\nthan that which my uncle had occasionally\\nshown in the same work. What\\nI wished was a comprehensive history of\\nthe site from its very settlement in 1636â\\x80\\x94or\\neven before, if any Narragansett\\nIndian legend could be unearthed to supply\\nthe data. I found, at the start, that\\nthe land had been part of the long strip\\nof home lot granted originally to John\\nThrockmorton; one of many similar strips\\nbeginning at the Town Street beside the\\nriver and extending up over the hill to a\\nline roughly corresponding with the\\nmodern Hope Street. The Throckmorton\\nlot had later, of course, been much subdivided;\\nand I became very assiduous in\\ntracing that section through which Back\\nor Benefit Street was later run. It had, as\\nrumor indeed said, been the Throckmorton\\ngraveyard; but as I examined the\\nrecords more carefully, I found that the\\ngraves had all been transferred at an\\nearly date to the North Burial Ground on\\nthe Pawtucket West Road.\\n\\nThen suddenly I cameâ\\x80\\x94by a rare piece\\nof chance, since it was not in the main\\nbody of records and might easily have\\nbeen missedâ\\x80\\x94upon something which\\naroused my keenest eagerness, fitting in\\nas it did with several of the queerest\\nphases of the affair. It was the record of\\na lease, in 1697, of a small tract of\\nground to an Etienne Roulet and wife.\\nAt last the French element had appearedâ\\x80\\x94that,\\nand another deeper element of\\nhorror which the name conjured up from\\nthe darkest recesses of my weird and\\nheterogeneous readingâ\\x80\\x94and I feverishly\\nstudied the platting of the locality as it\\nhad been before the cutting through and\\npartial straightening of Back Street between\\n1747 and 1758. I found what I\\nhad half expected, that where the\\nshunned house now stood the Roulets had\\nlaid out their graveyard behind a one-story\\nand attic cottage, and that no record\\nof any transfer of graves existed. The\\ndocument, indeed, ended in much confusion;\\nand I was forced to ransack both\\nthe Rhode Island Historical Society and\\nShepley Library before I could find a\\nlocal door which the name of Etienne\\nRoulet would unlock. In the end I did\\nfind something; something of such vague\\nbut monstrous import that I set about at\\nonce to examine the cellar of the shunned\\nhouse itself with a new and excited\\nminuteness.\\n\\nThe Roulets, it seemed, had come in\\n1696 from East Greenwich, down the\\nwest shore of Narragansett Bay. They\\nwere Huguenots from Caude, and had\\nencountered much opposition before the\\nProvidence selectmen allowed them to\\nsettle in the town. Unpopularity had\\ndogged them in East Greenwich, whither\\nthey had come in 1686, after the revocation\\nof the Edict of Nantes, and rumor\\nsaid that the cause of dislike extended\\nbeyond mere racial and national\\nprejudice, or the land disputes which involved\\nother French settlers with the\\nEnglish in rivalries which not even Governor\\nAndros could quell. But their\\nardent Protestantismâ\\x80\\x94too ardent, some\\nwhisperedâ\\x80\\x94and their evident distress\\nwhen virtually driven from the village\\ndown the bay, had moved the sympathy\\nof the town fathers. Here the strangers\\nhad been granted a haven; and the\\nswarthy Etienne Roulet, less apt at agriculture\\nthan at reading queer books and\\ndrawing queer diagrams, was given a\\nclerical post in the warehouse at Pardon\\nTillinghast\\'s wharf, far south in Town\\nStreet. There had, however, been a riot\\nof some sort later onâ\\x80\\x94perhaps forty\\nyears later, after old Roulet\\'s deathâ\\x80\\x94and\\nno one seemed to hear of the family\\nafter that.\\n\\nFor a century and more, it appeared,\\nthe Roulets had been well remembered\\nand frequently discussed as vivid incidents\\nin the quiet life of a New England\\nseaport. Etienne\\'s son Paul, a surly fellow\\nwhose erratic conduct had probably\\nprovoked the riot which wiped out the\\nfamily, was particularly a source of speculation;\\nand though Providence never\\nshared the witchcraft panics of her Puritan\\nneighbors, it was freely intimated by\\nold wives that his prayers were neither\\nuttered at the proper time nor directed\\ntoward the proper object. All this had\\nundoubtedly formed the basis of the legend\\nknown by old Maria Robbins. What\\nrelation it had to the French ravings of\\nRhoby Harris and other inhabitants of\\nthe shunned house, imagination or future\\ndiscovery alone could determine. I\\nwondered how many of those who had\\nknown the legends realized that additional\\nlink with the terrible which my\\nwider reading had given me; that ominous\\nitem in the annals of morbid horror\\nwhich tells of the creature Jacques\\nRoulet, of Caude , who in 1598 was condemned\\nto death as a demoniac but afterward\\nsaved from the stake by the Paris\\nparliament and shut in a madhouse. He\\nhad been found covered with blood and\\nshreds of flesh in a wood, shortly after\\nthe killing and rending of a boy by a\\npair of wolves. One wolf was seen to\\nlope away unhurt. Surely a pretty hearthside\\ntale, with a queer significance as to\\nname and place; but I decided that the\\nProvidence gossips could not have generally\\nknown of it. Had they known, the\\ncoincidence of names would have brought\\nsome drastic and frightened actionâ\\x80\\x94indeed,\\nmight not its limited whispering\\nhave precipitated the final riot which\\nerased the Roulets from the town?\\n\\nIÂ\\xa0now visited the accursed place with\\nincreased frequency; studying the unwholesome\\nvegetation of the garden, examining\\nall the walls of the building,\\nand poring over every inch of the\\nearthen cellar floor. Finally, with Carrington\\nHarris\\'s permission, I fitted a\\nkey to the disused door opening from the\\ncellar directly upon Benefit Street, preferring\\nto have a more immediate access\\nto the outside world than the dark stairs,\\nground-floor hall, and front door could\\ngive. There, where morbidity lurked most\\nthickly, I searched and poked during\\nlong afternoons when the sunlight filtered\\nin through the cobwebbed above-ground\\nwindows, and a sense of security glowed\\nfrom the unlocked door which placed\\nme only a few feet from the placid sidewalk\\noutside. Nothing new rewarded my\\neffortsâ\\x80\\x94only the same depressing mustiness\\nand faint suggestions of noxious\\nodors and nitrous outlines on the floorâ\\x80\\x94and\\nI fancy that many pedestrians must\\nhave watched me curiously through the\\nbroken panes.\\n\\nAt length, upon a suggestion of my\\nuncle\\'s, I decided to try the spot nocturnally;\\nand one stormy midnight ran the\\nbeams of an electric torch over the moldy\\nfloor with its uncanny shapes and distorted,\\nhalf-phosphorescent fungi. The\\nplace had dispirited me curiously that\\nevening, and I was almost prepared when\\nI sawâ\\x80\\x94or thought I sawâ\\x80\\x94amidst the\\nwhitish deposits a particularly sharp definition\\nof the \"huddled form\" I had suspected\\nfrom boyhood. Its clearness was\\nastonishing and unprecedentedâ\\x80\\x94and as I\\nwatched I seemed to see again the thin,\\nyellowish, shimmering exhalation which\\nhad startled me on that rainy afternoon\\nso many years before.\\n\\nAbove the anthropomorphic patch of\\nmold by the fireplace it rose; a subtle,\\nsickish, almost luminous vapor which as\\nit hung trembling in the dampness\\nseemed to develop vague and shocking\\nsuggestions of form, gradually trailing off\\ninto nebulous decay and passing up into\\nthe blackness of the great chimney with\\na fetor in its wake. It was truly horrible,\\nand the more so to me because of what I\\nknew of the spot. Refusing to flee, I\\nwatched it fadeâ\\x80\\x94and as I watched I felt\\nthat it was in turn watching me greedily\\nwith eyes more imaginable than visible.\\nWhen I told my uncle about it he was\\ngreatly aroused; and after a tense hour\\nof reflection, arrived at a definite and\\ndrastic decision. Weighing in his mind\\nthe importance of the matter, and the\\nsignificance of our relation to it, he insisted\\nthat we both testâ\\x80\\x94and if possible\\ndestroyâ\\x80\\x94the horror of the house by a\\njoint night or nights of aggressive vigil\\nin that musty and fungus-cursed cellar.\\n\\n4\\n\\nOn Wednesday , June 25, 1919,\\nafter a proper notification of Carrington\\nHarris which did not include\\nsurmises as to what we expected to find,\\nmy uncle and I conveyed to the shunned\\nhouse two camp chairs and a folding\\ncamp cot, together with some scientific\\nmechanism of greater weight and intricacy.\\nThese we placed in the cellar during\\nthe day, screening the windows with\\npaper and planning to return in the evening\\nfor our first vigil. We had locked\\nthe door from the cellar to the ground\\nfloor; and having a key to the outside\\ncellar door, were prepared to leave our\\nexpensive and delicate apparatusâ\\x80\\x94which\\nwe had obtained secretly and at great\\ncostâ\\x80\\x94as many days as our vigils might\\nbe protracted. It was our design to sit\\nup together till very late, and then watch\\nsingly till dawn in two-hour stretches,\\nmyself first and then my companion; the\\ninactive member resting on the cot.\\n\\nThe natural leadership with which my\\nuncle procured the instruments from the\\nlaboratories of Brown University and the\\nCranston Street Armory, and instinctively\\nassumed direction of our venture, was a\\nmarvelous commentary on the potential\\nvitality and resilience of a man of eighty-one.\\nElihu Whipple had lived according\\nto the hygienic laws he had preached as\\na physician, and but for what happened\\nlater would be here in full vigor today.\\nOnly two persons suspected what did\\nhappenâ\\x80\\x94Carrington Harris and myself.\\nI had to tell Harris because he owned\\nthe house and deserved to know what\\nhad gone out of it. Then too, we had\\nspoken to him in advance of our quest;\\nand I felt after my uncle\\'s going that he\\nwould understand and assist me in some\\nvitally necessary public explanations. He\\nturned very pale, but agreed to help me,\\nand decided that it would now be safe\\nto rent the house.\\n\\nTo declare that we were not nervous\\non that rainy night of watching would be\\nan exaggeration both gross and ridiculous.\\nWe were not, as I have said, in\\nany sense childishly superstitious, but scientific\\nstudy and reflection had taught us\\nthat the known universe of three dimensions\\nembraces the merest fraction of the\\nwhole cosmos of substance and energy. In\\nthis case an overwhelming preponderance\\nof evidence from numerous authentic\\nsources pointed to the tenacious existence\\nof certain forces of great power and, so\\nfar as the human point of view is concerned,\\nexceptional malignancy. To say\\nthat we actually believed in vampires or\\nwerewolves would be a carelessly inclusive\\nstatement. Rather must it be said that\\nwe were not prepared to deny the possibility\\nof certain unfamiliar and unclassified\\nmodifications of vital force and attenuated\\nmatter; existing very infrequently\\nin three-dimensional space because of\\nits more intimate connection with other\\nspatial units, yet close enough to the\\nboundary of our own to furnish us occasional\\nmanifestations which we, for\\nlack of a proper vantage-point, may never\\nhope to understand.\\n\\nIn short, it seemed to my uncle and\\nme that an incontrovertible array of facts\\npointed to some lingering influence in the\\nshunned house; traceable to one or another\\nof the ill-favored French settlers of\\ntwo centuries before, and still operative\\nthrough rare and unknown laws of\\natomic and electronic motion. That the\\nfamily of Roulet had possessed an abnormal\\naffinity for outer circles of entityâ\\x80\\x94dark\\nspheres which for normal folk\\nhold only repulsion and terrorâ\\x80\\x94their recorded\\nhistory seemed to prove. Had not,\\nthen, the riots of those bygone seventeen-thirties\\nset moving certain kinetic patterns\\nin the morbid brain of one or more of\\nthemâ\\x80\\x94notably the sinister Paul Rouletâ\\x80\\x94which\\nobscurely survived the bodies murdered\\nand buried by the mob, and continued\\nto function in some multiple-dimensioned\\nspace along the original\\nlines of force determined by a frantic\\nhatred of the encroaching community?\\n\\nSuch a thing was surely not a physical\\nor biochemical impossibility in the light\\nof a newer science which includes the\\ntheories of relativity and intra-atomic\\naction. One might easily imagine an alien\\nnucleus of substance or energy, formless\\nor otherwise, kept alive by imperceptible\\nor immaterial subtractions from the life-force\\nor bodily tissue and fluids of other\\nand more palpably living things into\\nwhich it penetrates and with whose fabric\\nit sometimes completely merges itself. It\\nmight be actively hostile, or it might be\\ndictated merely by blind motives of self-preservation.\\nIn any case such a monster\\nmust of necessity be in our scheme of\\nthings an anomaly and an intruder,\\nwhose extirpation forms a primary duty\\nwith every man not an enemy to the\\nworld\\'s life, health, and sanity.\\n\\nWhat baffled us was our utter ignorance\\nof the aspect in which we might encounter\\nthe thing. No sane person had\\never seen it, and few had ever felt it\\ndefinitely. It might be pure energyâ\\x80\\x94a\\nform ethereal and outside the realm of\\nsubstanceâ\\x80\\x94or it might be partly material;\\nsome unknown and equivocal mass of\\nplasticity, capable of changing at will to\\nnebulous approximations of the solid,\\nliquid, gaseous, or tenuously unparticled\\nstates. The anthropomorphic patch of\\nmold on the floor, the form of the yellowish\\nvapor, and the curvature of the\\ntree-roots in some of the old tales, all\\nargued at least a remote and reminiscent\\nconnection with the human shape; but\\nhow representative or permanent that\\nsimilarity might be, none could say with\\nany kind of certainty.\\n\\nWe had devised two weapons to\\nfight it; a large and specially fitted\\nCrookes tube operated by powerful storage\\nbatteries and provided with peculiar\\nscreens and reflectors, in case it proved\\nintangible and opposable only by vigorously\\ndestructive ether radiations, and a\\npair of military flame-throwers of the sort\\nused in the World War, in case it proved\\npartly material and susceptible of mechanical\\ndestructionâ\\x80\\x94for like the superstitious\\nExeter rustics, we were prepared\\nto burn the thing\\'s heart out if heart\\nexisted to burn. All this aggressive mechanism\\nwe set in the cellar in positions\\ncarefully arranged with reference to the\\ncot and chairs, and to the spot before the\\nfireplace where the mold had taken\\nstrange shapes. That suggestive patch, by\\nthe way, was only faintly visible when we\\nplaced our furniture and instruments, and\\nwhen we returned that evening for the\\nactual vigil. For a moment I half doubted\\nthat I had ever seen it in the more definitely\\nlimned formâ\\x80\\x94but then I thought\\nof the legends.\\n\\nOur cellar vigil began at ten p. m.,\\ndaylight saving time, and as it continued\\nwe found no promise of pertinent developments.\\nA weak, filtered glow from the\\nrain-harassed street-lamps outside, and a\\nfeeble phosphorescence from the detestable\\nfungi within, showed the dripping\\nstone of the walls, from which all traces\\nof whitewash had vanished; the dank,\\nfetid and mildew-tainted hard earth floor\\nwith its obscene fungi; the rotting remains\\nof what had been stools, chairs, and\\ntables, and other more shapeless furniture;\\nthe heavy planks and massive beams\\nof the ground floor overhead; the decrepit\\nplank door leading to bins and\\nchambers beneath other parts of the\\nhouse; the crumbling stone staircase with\\nruined wooden hand-rail; and the crude\\nand cavernous fireplace of blackened\\nbrick where rusted iron fragments revealed\\nthe past presence of hooks, andirons,\\nspit, crane, and a door to the\\nDutch ovenâ\\x80\\x94these things, and our austere\\ncot and camp chairs, and the heavy\\nand intricate destructive machinery we\\nhad brought.\\n\\nWe had, as in my own former explorations,\\nleft the door to the street unlocked;\\nso that a direct and practical path\\nof escape might lie open in case of\\nmanifestations beyond our power to deal\\nwith. It was our idea that our continued\\nnocturnal presence would call forth whatever\\nmalign entity lurked there; and that\\nbeing prepared, we could dispose of the\\nthing with one or the other of our provided\\nmeans as soon as we had recognized\\nand observed it sufficiently. How long it\\nmight require to evoke and extinguish\\nthe thing, we had no notion. It occurred\\nto us, too, that our venture was\\nfar from safe; for in what strength the\\nthing might appear no one could tell.\\nBut we deemed the game worth the\\nhazard, and embarked on it alone and\\nunhesitatingly; conscious that the seeking\\nof outside aid would only expose us to\\nridicule and perhaps defeat our entire\\npurpose. Such was our frame of mind as\\nwe talkedâ\\x80\\x94far into the night, till my\\nuncle\\'s growing drowsiness made me remind\\nhim to lie down for his two-hour\\nsleep.\\n\\nSomething like fear chilled me as I\\nsat there in the small hours aloneâ\\x80\\x94I say\\nalone, for one who sits by a sleeper is\\nindeed alone; perhaps more alone than\\nhe can realize. My uncle breathed heavily,\\nhis deep inhalations and exhalations\\naccompanied by the rain outside, and\\npunctuated by another nerve-racking\\nsound of distant dripping water withinâ\\x80\\x94for\\nthe house was repulsively damp even\\nin dry weather, and in this storm positively\\nswamp-like. I studied the loose,\\nantique masonry of the walls in the\\nfungus-light and the feeble rays which\\nstole in from the street through the\\nscreened window; and once, when the\\nnoisome atmosphere of the place seemed\\nabout to sicken me, I opened the door\\nand looked up and down the street,\\nfeasting my eyes on familiar sights and\\nmy nostrils on wholesome air. Still nothing\\noccurred to reward my watching; and\\nI yawned repeatedly, fatigue getting the\\nbetter of apprehension.\\n\\nThen the stirring of my uncle in his\\nsleep attracted my notice. He had turned\\nrestlessly on the cot several times during\\nthe latter half of the first hour, but now\\nhe was breathing with unusual irregularity,\\noccasionally heaving a sigh which\\nheld more than a few of the qualities of\\na choking moan.\\n\\nI turned my electric flashlight on him\\nand found his face averted; so rising and\\ncrossing to the other side of the cot, I\\nagain flashed the light to see if he seemed\\nin any pain. What I saw unnerved me\\nmost surprisingly, considering its relative\\ntriviality. It must have been merely the\\nassociation of any odd circumstance with\\nthe sinister nature of our location and\\nmission, for surely the circumstance was\\nnot in itself frightful or unnatural. It\\nwas merely that my uncle\\'s facial expression,\\ndisturbed no doubt by the strange\\ndreams which our situation prompted,\\nbetrayed considerable agitation, and\\nseemed not at all characteristic of him.\\nHis habitual expression was one of kindly\\nand well-bred calm, whereas now a variety\\nof emotions seemed struggling within\\nhim. I think, on the whole, that it was\\nthis variety which chiefly disturbed me.\\nMy uncle, as he gasped and tossed in\\nincreasing perturbation and with eyes that\\nhad now started open, seemed not one\\nbut many men, and suggested a curious\\nquality of alienage from himself.\\n\\nAll at once he commenced to mutter,\\nand I did not like the look of his\\nmouth and teeth as he spoke. The words\\nwere at first indistinguishable, and thenâ\\x80\\x94with\\na tremendous startâ\\x80\\x94I recognized\\nsomething about them which filled me\\nwith icy fear till I recalled the breadth\\nof my uncle\\'s education and the interminable\\ntranslations he had made from\\nanthropological and antiquarian articles in\\nthe Revue des Deux Mondes . For the\\nvenerable Elihu Whipple was muttering in French , and the few phrases I could\\ndistinguish seemed connected with the\\ndarkest myths he had ever adapted from\\nthe famous Paris magazine.\\n\\nSuddenly a perspiration broke out on\\nthe sleeper\\'s forehead, and he leaped\\nabruptly up, half awake. The jumble of\\nFrench changed to a cry in English, and\\nthe hoarse voice shouted excitedly, \"My\\nbreath, my breath!\" Then the awakening\\nbecame complete, and with a subsidence\\nof facial expression to the normal state\\nmy uncle seized my hand and began to\\nrelate a dream whose nucleus of significance\\nI could only surmise with a kind\\nof awe.\\n\\nHe had, he said, floated off from a very\\nordinary series of dream-pictures into a\\nscene whose strangeness was related to\\nnothing he had ever read. It was of this\\nworld, and yet not of itâ\\x80\\x94a shadowy\\ngeometrical confusion in which could be\\nseen elements of familiar things in most\\nunfamiliar and perturbing combinations.\\nThere was a suggestion of queerly disordered\\npictures superimposed one upon\\nanother; an arrangement in which the\\nessentials of time as well as of space\\nseemed dissolved and mixed in the most\\nillogical fashion. In this kaleidoscopic\\nvortex of phantasmal images were occasional\\nsnap-shots, if one might use the\\nterm, of singular clearness but unaccountable\\nheterogeneity.\\n\\nOnce my uncle thought he lay in a\\ncarelessly dug open pit, with a crowd of\\nangry faces framed by straggling locks\\nand three-cornered hats frowning down\\non him. Again he seemed to be in the\\ninterior of a houseâ\\x80\\x94an old house, apparentlyâ\\x80\\x94but\\nthe details and inhabitants\\nwere constantly changing, and he could\\nnever be certain of the faces or the furniture,\\nor even of the room itself, since\\ndoors and windows seemed in just as\\ngreat a state of flux as the presumably\\nmore mobile objects. It was queerâ\\x80\\x94damnably\\nqueerâ\\x80\\x94and my uncle spoke\\nalmost sheepishly, as if half expecting\\nnot to be believed, when he declared\\nthat of the strange faces many had unmistakably\\nborne the features of the\\nHarris family. And all the while there\\nwas a personal sensation of choking, as\\nif some pervasive presence had spread\\nitself through his body and sought to\\npossess itself of his vital processes.\\n\\nI shuddered at the thought of those\\nvital processes, worn as they were by\\neighty-one years of continuous functioning,\\nin conflict with unknown forces of\\nwhich the youngest and strongest system\\nmight well be afraid; but in another\\nmoment reflected that dreams are only\\ndreams, and that these uncomfortable\\nvisions could be, at most, no more than\\nmy uncle\\'s reaction to the investigations\\nand expectations which had lately filled\\nour minds to the exclusion of all else.\\n\\nConversation, also, soon tended to dispel\\nmy sense of strangeness; and in time\\nI yielded to my yawns and took my turn\\nat slumber. My uncle seemed now very\\nwakeful, and welcomed his period of\\nwatching even though the nightmare had\\naroused him far ahead of his allotted two\\nhours.\\n\\nSleep seized me quickly, and I was at\\nonce haunted with dreams of the most\\ndisturbing kind. I felt, in my visions, a\\ncosmic and abysmal loneness; with hostility\\nsurging from all sides upon some\\nprison where I lay confined. I seemed\\nbound and gagged, and taunted by the\\nechoing yells of distant multitudes who\\nthirsted for my blood. My uncle\\'s face\\ncame to me with less pleasant association\\nthan in waking hours, and I recall many\\nfutile struggles and attempts to scream.\\nIt was not a pleasant sleep, and for a\\nsecond I was not sorry for the echoing\\nshriek which clove through the barriers\\nof dream and flung me to a sharp and\\nstartled awakeness in which every actual\\nobject before my eyes stood out with\\nmore than natural clearness and reality.\\n\\n5\\n\\nIÂ\\xa0had been lying with my face away\\nfrom my uncle\\'s chair, so that in this\\nsudden flash of awakening I saw\\nonly the door to the street, the window,\\nand the wall and floor and ceiling\\ntoward the north of the room, all\\nphotographed with morbid vividness on\\nmy brain in a light brighter than the\\nglow of the fungi or the rays from the\\nstreet outside. It was not a strong or\\neven a fairly strong light; certainly not\\nnearly strong enough to read an average\\nbook by. But it cast a shadow of myself\\nand the cot on the floor, and had a\\nyellowish, penetrating force that hinted\\nat things more potent than luminosity.\\nThis I perceived with unhealthy sharpness\\ndespite the fact that two of my other\\nsenses were violently assailed. For on my\\nears rang the reverberations of that\\nshocking scream, while my nostrils revolted\\nat the stench which filled the\\nplace. My mind, as alert as my senses,\\nrecognized the gravely unusual; and almost\\nautomatically I leaped up and turned\\nabout to grasp the destructive instruments\\nwhich we had left trained on the\\nmoldy spot before the fireplace. As I\\nturned, I dreaded what I was to see; for\\nthe scream had been in my uncle\\'s voice,\\nand I knew not against what menace I\\nshould have to defend him and myself.\\n\\nYet after all, the sight was worse than\\nI had dreaded. There are horrors beyond\\nhorrors, and this was one of those nuclei\\nof all dreamable hideousness which the\\ncosmos saves to blast an accursed and unhappy\\nfew. Out of the fungus-ridden\\nearth steamed up a vaporous corpse-light,\\nyellow and diseased, which bubbled and\\nlapped to a gigantic height in vague outlines\\nhalf human and half monstrous,\\nthrough which I could see the chimney\\nand fireplace beyond. It was all eyesâ\\x80\\x94wolfish\\nand mockingâ\\x80\\x94and the rugose\\ninsect-like head dissolved at the top to a\\nthin stream of mist which curled putridly\\nabout and finally vanished up the chimney.\\nI say that I saw this thing, but it is\\nonly in conscious retrospection that I ever\\ndefinitely traced its damnable approach to\\nform. At the time, it was to me only a\\nseething, dimly phosphorescent cloud of\\nfungous loathsomeness, enveloping and\\ndissolving to an abhorrent plasticity the\\none object on which all my attention was\\nfocussed. That object was my uncleâ\\x80\\x94the\\nvenerable Elihu Whippleâ\\x80\\x94who with\\nblackening and decaying features leered\\nand gibbered at me, and reached out\\ndripping claws to rend me in the fury\\nwhich this horror had brought.\\n\\nIt was a sense of routine which kept\\nme from going mad. I had drilled myself\\nin preparation for the crucial moment,\\nand blind training saved me. Recognizing\\nthe bubbling evil as no substance\\nreachable by matter or material\\nchemistry, and therefore ignoring the\\nflame-thrower which loomed on my left,\\nI threw on the current of the Crookes\\ntube apparatus, and focussed toward that\\nscene of immortal blasphemousness the\\nstrongest ether radiations which man\\'s\\nart can arouse from the spaces and fluids\\nof nature. There was a bluish haze and\\na frenzied sputtering, and the yellowish\\nphosphorescence grew dimmer to my eyes.\\nBut I saw the dimness was only that of\\ncontrast, and that the waves from the\\nmachine had no effect whatever.\\n\\nThen, in the midst of that demoniac\\nspectacle, I saw a fresh horror which\\nbrought cries to my lips and sent me\\nfumbling and staggering toward that unlocked\\ndoor to the quiet street, careless\\nof what abnormal terrors I loosed upon\\nthe world, or what thoughts or judgments\\nof men I brought down upon my\\nhead. In that dim blend of blue and\\nyellow the form of my uncle had commenced\\na nauseous liquefaction whose\\nessence eludes all description, and in\\nwhich there played across his vanishing\\nface such changes of identity as only\\nmadness can conceive. He was at once\\na devil and a multitude, a charnel-house\\nand a pageant. Lit by the mixed and uncertain\\nbeams, that gelatinous face assumed\\na dozenâ\\x80\\x94a scoreâ\\x80\\x94a hundredâ\\x80\\x94aspects;\\ngrinning, as it sank to the ground\\non a body that melted like tallow, in the\\ncaricatured likeness of legions strange\\nand yet not strange.\\n\\nI saw the features of the Harris line,\\nmasculine and feminine, adult and infantile,\\nand other features old and young,\\ncoarse and refined, familiar and unfamiliar.\\nFor a second there flashed a\\ndegraded counterfeit of a miniature of\\npoor mad Rhoby Harris that I had seen\\nin the School of Design museum, and\\nanother time I thought I caught the raw-boned\\nimage of Mercy Dexter as I recalled\\nher from a painting in Carrington\\nHarris\\'s house. It was frightful beyond\\nconception; toward the last, when\\na curious blend of servant and baby\\nvisages flickered close to the fungous floor\\nwhere a pool of greenish grease was\\nspreading, it seemed as though the shifting\\nfeatures fought against themselves\\nand strove to form contours like those\\nof my uncle\\'s kindly face. I like to think\\nthat he existed at that moment, and that\\nhe tried to bid me farewell. It seems to\\nme I hiccupped a farewell from my own\\nparched throat as I lurched out into the\\nstreet; a thin stream of grease following\\nme through the door to the rain-drenched\\nsidewalk.\\n\\nThe rest is shadowy and monstrous.\\nThere was no one in the soaking\\nstreet, and in all the world there was no\\none I dared tell. I walked aimlessly south\\npast College Hill and the AthenÃ¦um,\\ndown Hopkins Street, and over the bridge\\nto the business section where tall buildings\\nseemed to guard me as modern\\nmaterial things guard the world from\\nancient and unwholesome wonder. Then\\ngray dawn unfolded wetly from the east,\\nsilhouetting the archaic hill and its venerable\\nsteeples, and beckoning me to the\\nplace where my terrible work was still\\nunfinished. And in the end I went, wet,\\nhatless, and dazed in the morning light,\\nand entered that awful door in Benefit\\nStreet which I had left ajar, and which\\nstill swung cryptically in full sight of the\\nearly householders to whom I dared not\\nspeak.\\n\\nThe grease was gone, for the moldy\\nfloor was porous. And in front of the\\nfireplace was no vestige of the giant doubled-up\\nform traced in niter. I looked\\nat the cot, the chairs, the instruments, my\\nneglected hat, and the yellowed straw hat\\nof my uncle. Dazedness was uppermost,\\nand I could scarcely recall what was\\ndream and what was reality. Then\\nthought trickled back, and I knew that I\\nhad witnessed things more horrible than\\nI had dreamed.\\n\\nSitting down, I tried to conjecture as\\nnearly as sanity would let me just what\\nhad happened, and how I might end the\\nhorror, if indeed it had been real. Matter\\nit seemed not to be, nor ether, nor anything\\nelse conceivable by mortal mind.\\nWhat, then, but some exotic emanation ;\\nsome vampirish vapor such as Exeter\\nrustics tell of as lurking over certain\\nchurchyards? This I felt was the clue,\\nand again I looked at the floor before\\nthe fireplace where the mold and niter\\nhad taken strange forms.\\n\\nIn ten minutes my mind was made up,\\nand taking my hat I set out for home,\\nwhere I bathed, ate, and gave by telephone\\nan order for a pickax, a spade, a\\nmilitary gas-mask, and six carboys of\\nsulfuric acid, all to be delivered the next\\nmorning at the cellar door of the shunned\\nhouse in Benefit Street. After that I tried\\nto sleep; and failing, passed the hours in\\nreading and in the composition of inane\\nverses to counteract my mood.\\n\\nAt eleven a. m. the next day I commenced\\ndigging. It was sunny weather,\\nand I was glad of that. I was still alone,\\nfor as much as I feared the unknown\\nhorror I sought, there was more fear in\\nthe thought of telling anybody. Later I\\ntold Harris only through sheer necessity,\\nand because he had heard odd tales from\\nold people which disposed him ever so\\nlittle toward belief. As I turned up the\\nstinking black earth in front of the fireplace,\\nmy spade causing a viscous yellow\\nichor to ooze from the white fungi which\\nit severed, I trembled at the dubious\\nthoughts of what I might uncover. Some\\nsecrets of inner earth are not good for\\nmankind, and this seemed to me one of\\nthem.\\n\\nMy hand shook perceptibly, but still I\\ndelved; after a while standing in the\\nlarge hole I had made. With the deepening\\nof the hole, which was about six\\nfeet square, the evil smell increased; and\\nI lost all doubt of my imminent contact\\nwith the hellish thing whose emanations\\nhad cursed the house for over a century\\nand a half. I wondered what it would\\nlook likeâ\\x80\\x94what its form and substance\\nwould be, and how big it might have\\nwaxed through long ages of life-sucking.\\nAt length I climbed out of the hole and\\ndispersed the heaped-up dirt, then arranging\\nthe great carboys of acid around and\\nnear two sides, so that when necessary\\nI might empty them all down the aperture\\nin quick succession. After that I dumped\\nearth only along the other two sides;\\nworking more slowly and donning my\\ngas-mask as the smell grew. I was nearly\\nunnerved at my proximity to a nameless\\nthing at the bottom of a pit.\\n\\nSuddenly my spade struck something\\nsofter than earth. I shuddered, and made\\na motion as if to climb out of the hole,\\nwhich was now as deep as my neck. Then\\ncourage returned, and I scraped away\\nmore dirt in the light of the electric\\ntorch I had provided. The surface I uncovered\\nwas fishy and glassyâ\\x80\\x94a kind of\\nsemi-putrid congealed jelly with suggestions\\nof translucency. I scraped further,\\nand saw that it had form. There was a\\nrift where a part of the substance was\\nfolded over. The exposed area was huge\\nand roughly cylindrical; like a mammoth\\nsoft blue-white stovepipe doubled in two,\\nits largest part some two feet in diameter.\\nStill more I scraped, and then abruptly I\\nleaped out of the hole and away from the\\nfilthy thing; frantically unstopping and\\ntilting the heavy carboys, and precipitating\\ntheir corrosive contents one after another\\ndown that charnel gulf and upon\\nthe unthinkable abnormality whose titan elbow I had seen.\\n\\nThe blinding maelstrom of greenish-yellow\\nvapor which surged tempestuously\\nup from that hole as the floods of\\nacid descended, will never leave my\\nmemory. All along the hill people tell of\\nthe yellow day, when virulent and horrible\\nfumes arose from the factory waste\\ndumped in the Providence River, but I\\nknow how mistaken they are as to the\\nsource. They tell, too, of the hideous\\nroar which at the same time came from\\nsome disordered water-pipe or gas main\\nundergroundâ\\x80\\x94but again I could correct\\nthem if I dared. It was unspeakably\\nshocking, and I do not see how I lived\\nthrough it. I did faint after emptying\\nthe fourth carboy, which I had to handle\\nafter the fumes had begun to penetrate\\nmy mask; but when I recovered I saw\\nthat the hole was emitting no fresh\\nvapors.\\n\\nThe two remaining carboys I emptied\\ndown without particular result, and after\\na time I felt it safe to shovel the earth\\nback into the pit. It was twilight before\\nI was done, but fear had gone out of the\\nplace. The dampness was less fetid, and\\nall the strange fungi had withered to a\\nkind of harmless grayish powder which\\nblew ash-like along the floor. One of\\nearth\\'s nethermost terrors had perished\\nfor ever; and if there be a hell, it had\\nreceived at last the demon soul of an\\nunhallowed thing. And as I patted down\\nthe last spadeful of mold, I shed the\\nfirst of the many tears with which I have\\npaid unaffected tribute to my beloved\\nuncle\\'s memory.\\n\\nThe next spring no more pale grass\\nand strange weeds came up in the shunned\\nhouse\\'s terraced garden, and shortly afterward\\nCarrington Harris rented the place.\\nIt is still spectral, but its strangeness\\nfascinates me, and I shall find mixed with\\nmy relief a queer regret when it is torn\\ndown to make way for a tawdry shop or\\nvulgar apartment building. The barren\\nold trees in the yard have begun to bear\\nsmall, sweet apples, and last year the\\nbirds nested in their gnarled boughs.\\n\\nTranscriber\\'s Note:\\n\\nThis etext was produced from Weird Tales October 1937.\\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\\ncopyright on this publication was renewed.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\\n\\nIt is true that I have sent six bullets through the head of my best\\nfriend, and yet I hope to show by this statement that I am not his\\nmurderer. At first I shall be called a madmanâ\\x80\\x94madder than the man I\\nshot in his cell at the Arkham Sanitarium. Later some of my readers\\nwill weigh each statement, correlate it with the known facts, and ask\\nthemselves how I could have believed otherwise than as I did after\\nfacing the evidence of that horrorâ\\x80\\x94that thing on the door-step.\\n\\nUntil then I also saw nothing but madness in the wild tales I have\\nacted on. Even now I ask myself whether I was misledâ\\x80\\x94or whether I\\nam not mad after all. I do not knowâ\\x80\\x94but others have strange things\\nto tell of Edward and Asenath Derby, and even the stolid police are\\nat their wits\\' ends to account for that last terrible visit. They\\nhave tried weakly to concoct a theory of a ghastly jest or warning by\\ndischarged servants; yet they know in their hearts that the truth is\\nsomething infinitely more terrible and incredible.\\n\\nSo I say that I have not murdered Edward Derby. Rather have I avenged\\nhim, and in so doing purged the earth of a horror whose survival might\\nhave loosed untold terrors on all mankind. There are black zones of\\nshadow close to our daily paths, and now and then some evil soul breaks\\na passage through. When that happens, the man who knows must strike\\nbefore reckoning the consequences.\\n\\nI have known Edward Pickman Derby all his life. Eight years my junior,\\nhe was so precocious that we had much in common from the time he was\\neight and I sixteen. He was the most phenomenal child scholar I have\\never known, and at seven was writing verse of a somber, fantastic,\\nalmost morbid cast which astonished the tutors surrounding him. Perhaps\\nhis private education and coddled seclusion had something to do with\\nhis premature flowering. An only child, he had organic weaknesses\\nwhich startled his doting parents and caused them to keep him closely\\nchained to their side. He was never allowed out without his nurse, and\\nseldom had a chance to play unconstrainedly with other children. All\\nthis doubtless fostered a strange secretive inner life in the boy, with\\nimagination as his one avenue of freedom.\\n\\nAt any rate, his juvenile learning was prodigious and bizarre; and his\\nfacile writings such as to captivate me despite my greater age. About\\nthat time I had leanings toward art of a somewhat grotesque cast, and\\nI found in this younger child a rare kindred spirit. What lay behind\\nour joint love of shadows and marvels was, no doubt, the ancient,\\nmoldering, and subtly fearsome town in which we livedâ\\x80\\x94witch-cursed,\\nlegend-haunted Arkham, whose huddled, sagging gambrel roofs and\\ncrumbling Georgian balustrades brood out the centuries beside the\\ndarkly muttering Miskatonic.\\n\\nAs time went by I turned to architecture and gave up my design of\\nillustrating a book of Edward\\'s demoniac poems, yet our comradeship\\nsuffered no lessening. Young Derby\\'s odd genius developed remarkably,\\nand in his eighteenth year his collected nightmare-lyrics made a real\\nsensation when issued under the title Azathoth and Other Horrors . He\\nwas a close correspondent of the notorious Baudelairean poet Justin\\nGeoffrey, who wrote The People of the Monolith and died screaming in\\na madhouse in 1926 after a visit to a sinister, ill-regarded village in\\nHungary.\\n\\nIn self-reliance and practical affairs, however, Derby was greatly\\nretarded because of his coddled existence. His health had improved,\\nbut his habits of childish dependence were fostered by over-careful\\nparents, so that he never traveled alone, made independent decisions,\\nor assumed responsibilities. It was early seen that he would not be\\nequal to a struggle in the business or professional arena, but the\\nfamily fortune was so ample that this formed no tragedy. As he grew\\nto years of manhood he retained a deceptive aspect of boyishness.\\nBlond and blue-eyed, he had the fresh complexion of a child, and his\\nattempts to raise a mustache were discernible only with difficulty. His\\nvoice was soft and light, and his unexercised life gave him a juvenile\\nchubbiness rather than the paunchiness of premature middle age. He was\\nof good height, and his handsome face would have made him a notable\\ngallant had not his shyness held him to seclusion and bookishness.\\n\\nDerby\\'s parents took him abroad every summer, and he was quick to seize\\non the surface aspects of European thought and expression. His Poe-like\\ntalents turned more and more toward the decadent, and other artistic\\nsensitivenesses and yearnings were half aroused in him.\\n\\nWe had great discussions in those days. I had been through Harvard, had\\nstudied in a Boston architect\\'s office, had married, and had finally\\nreturned to Arkham to practise my professionâ\\x80\\x94settling in the family\\nhomestead in Salton-stall Street, since my father had moved to Florida\\nfor his health. Edward used to call almost every evening, till I came\\nto regard him as one of the household. He had a characteristic way\\nof ringing the door-bell or sounding the knocker that grew to be a\\nveritable code signal, so that after dinner I always listened for the\\nfamiliar three brisk strokes followed by two more after a pause. Less\\nfrequently I would visit at his house and note with envy the obscure\\nvolumes in his constantly growing library.\\n\\nDerby went through Miskatonic University in Arkham, since his parents\\nwould not let him board away from them. He entered at sixteen and\\ncompleted his course in three years, majoring in English and French\\nliterature and receiving high marks in everything but mathematics\\nand the sciences. He mingled very little with the other students,\\nthough looking enviously at the \"daring\" or \"Bohemian\" setâ\\x80\\x94whose\\nsuperficially \"smart\" language and meaninglessly ironic pose he aped,\\nand whose dubious conduct he wished he dared adopt.\\n\\nWhat he did do was to become an almost fanatical devotee of\\nsubterranean magical lore, for which Miskatonic\\'s library was and is\\nfamous. Always a dweller on the surface of fantasy and strangeness, he\\nnow delved deep into the actual runes and riddles left by a fabulous\\npast for the guidance or puzzlement of posterity. He read things like\\nthe frightful Book of Eibon , the Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von\\nJunzt, and the forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred,\\nthough he did not tell his parents he had seen them. Edward was twenty\\nwhen my son and only child was born, and seemed pleased when I named\\nthe newcomer Edward Derby Upton, after him.\\n\\nBy the time he was twenty-five Edward Derby was a prodigiously learned\\nman and a fairly well-known poet and fantaisiste , though his lack\\nof contacts and responsibilities had slowed down his literary growth\\nby making his products derivative and over-bookish. I was perhaps his\\nclosest friendâ\\x80\\x94finding him an inexhaustible mine of vital theoretical\\ntopics, while he relied on me for advice in whatever matters he did not\\nwish to refer to his parents. He remained singleâ\\x80\\x94more through shyness,\\ninertia and parental protectiveness than through inclinationâ\\x80\\x94and moved\\nin society only to the slightest and most perfunctory extent. When the\\nwar came both health and ingrained timidity kept him at home. I went to\\nPlattsburg for a commission, but never got overseas.\\n\\nSo the years wore on. Edward\\'s mother died when he was thirty-four, and\\nfor months he was incapacitated by some odd psychological malady. His\\nfather took him to Europe, however, and he managed to pull out of his\\ntrouble without visible effects. Afterward he seemed to feel a sort\\nof grotesque exhilaration, as if of partial escape from some unseen\\nbondage. He began to mingle in the more \"advanced\" college set despite\\nhis middle age, and was present at some extremely wild doingsâ\\x80\\x94on one\\noccasion paying heavy blackmail (which he borrowed of me) to keep his\\npresence at a certain affair from his father\\'s notice. Some of the\\nwhispered rumors about the wild Miskatonic set were extremely singular.\\nThere was even talk of black magic and of happenings utterly beyond\\ncredibility.\\n\\n2\\n\\nEdward was thirty-eight when he met Asenath Waite. She was, I judge,\\nabout twenty-three at the time; and was taking a special course in\\nmediÃ¦val meta-physics at Miskatonic. The daughter of a friend of mine\\nhad met her beforeâ\\x80\\x94in the Hall School at Kingsportâ\\x80\\x94and had been\\ninclined to shun her because of her odd reputation. She was dark,\\nsmallish, and very good-looking except for over-protuberant eyes; but\\nsomething in her expression alienated extremely sensitive people. It\\nwas, however, largely her origin and conversation which caused average\\nfolk to avoid her. She was one of the Innsmouth Waites, and dark\\nlegends have clustered for generations about crumbling, half-deserted\\nInnsmouth and its people. There are tales of horrible bargains about\\nthe year 1850, and of a strange element \"not quite human\" in the\\nancient families of the run-down fishing-portâ\\x80\\x94tales such as only\\nold-time Yankees can devise and repeat with proper awesomeness.\\n\\nAsenath\\'s case was aggravated by the fact that she was Ephraim Waite\\'s\\ndaughterâ\\x80\\x94the child of his old age by an unknown wife who always went\\nveiled. Ephraim lived in a half-decayed mansion in Washington Street,\\nInnsmouth, and those who had seen the place (Arkham folk avoid going\\nto Innsmouth whenever they can) declared that the attic windows were\\nalways boarded, and that strange sounds sometimes floated from within\\nas evening drew on. The old man was known to have been a prodigious\\nmagical student in his day, and legend averred that he could raise\\nor quell storms at sea according to his whim. I had seen him once or\\ntwice in my youth as he came to Arkham to consult forbidden tomes at\\nthe college library, and had hated his wolfish, saturnine face with\\nits tangle of iron-gray beard. He had died insaneâ\\x80\\x94under rather queer\\ncircumstancesâ\\x80\\x94just before his daughter (by his will made a nominal\\nward of the principal) entered the Hall School, but she had been his\\nmorbidly avid pupil and looked fiendishly like him at times.\\n\\nThe friend whose daughter had gone to school with Asenath Waite\\nrepeated many curious things when the news of Edward\\'s acquaintance\\nwith her began to spread about. Asenath, it seemed, had posed as a\\nkind of magician at school; and had really seemed able to accomplish\\nsome highly baffling marvels. She professed to be able to raise\\nthunderstorms, though her seeming success was generally laid to some\\nuncanny knack at prediction. All animals markedly disliked her, and she\\ncould make any dog howl by certain motions of her right hand. There\\nwere times when she displayed snatches of knowledge and language very\\nsingularâ\\x80\\x94and very shockingâ\\x80\\x94for a young girl; when she would frighten\\nher schoolmates with leers and winks of an inexplicable kind, and would\\nseem to extract an obscene and zestful irony from her present situation.\\n\\nMost unusual, though, were the well-attested cases of her influence\\nover other persons. She was, beyond question, a genuine hypnotist. By\\ngazing peculiarly at a fellow-student she would often give the latter\\na distinct feeling of exchanged personality â\\x80\\x94as if the subject were\\nplaced momentarily in the magician\\'s body and able to stare half across\\nthe room at her real body, whose eyes blazed and protruded with an\\nalien expression. Asenath often made wild claims about the nature of\\nconsciousness and about its independence of the physical frameâ\\x80\\x94or\\nat least from the life-processes of the physical frame. Her crowning\\nrage, however, was that she was not a man; since she believed a male\\nbrain had certain unique and far-reaching cosmic powers. Given a man\\'s\\nbrain, she declared, she could not only equal but surpass her father in\\nmastery of unknown forces.\\n\\nEdward met Asenath at a gathering of \"intelligentsia\" held in one of\\nthe students\\' rooms, and could talk of nothing else when he came to see\\nme the next day. He had found her full of the interests and erudition\\nwhich engrossed him most, and was in addition wildly taken with her\\nappearance. I had never seen the young woman, and recalled casual\\nreferences only faintly, but I knew who she was. It seemed rather\\nregrettable that Derby should become so upheaved about her; but I said\\nnothing to discourage him, since infatuation thrives on opposition. He\\nwas not, he said, mentioning her to his father.\\n\\nIn the next few weeks I heard of very little but Asenath from young\\nDerby. Others now remarked Edward\\'s autumnal gallantry, though they\\nagreed that he did not look even nearly his actual age, or seem at\\nall inappropriate as an escort for his bizarre divinity. He was only\\na trifle paunchy despite his indolence and self-indulgence, and his\\nface was absolutely without lines. Asenath, on the other hand, had the\\npremature crow\\'s-feet which come from the exercise of an intense will.\\n\\nAbout this time Edward brought the girl to call on me, and I at\\nonce saw that his interest was by no means one-sided. She eyed him\\ncontinually with an almost predatory air, and I perceived that their\\nintimacy was beyond untangling. Soon afterward I had a visit from old\\nMr. Derby, whom I had always admired and respected. He had heard the\\ntales of his son\\'s new friendship and had wormed the whole truth out\\nof \"the boy\". Edward meant to marry Asenath, and had even been looking\\nat houses in the suburbs. Knowing my usually great influence with his\\nson, the father wondered if I could help to break the ill-advised\\naffair off; but I regretfully expressed my doubts. This time it was not\\na question of Edward\\'s weak will but of the woman\\'s strong will. The\\nperennial child had transferred his dependence from the parental image\\nto a new and stronger image, and nothing could be done about it.\\n\\nThe wedding was performed a month later by a justice of the peace\\naccording to the bride\\'s request. Mr. Derby, at my advice, offered\\nno opposition, and he, my wife, my son and I attended the brief\\nceremonyâ\\x80\\x94the other guests being wild young people from the college.\\nAsenath had bought the old Crowninshield place in the country at the\\nend of High Street, and they proposed to settle there after a short\\ntrip to Innsmouth, whence three servants and some books and household\\ngoods were to be brought. It was probably not so much consideration for\\nEdward and his father as a personal wish to be near the college, its\\nlibrary, and its crowd of \"sophisticates\", that made Asenath settle in\\nArkham instead of returning permanently home.\\n\\nWhen Edward called on me after the honeymoon I thought he looked\\nslightly changed. Asenath had made him get rid of the undeveloped\\nmustache, but there was more than that. He looked soberer and more\\nthoughtful, his habitual pout of childish rebelliousness being\\nexchanged for a look almost of genuine sadness. I was puzzled to decide\\nwhether I liked or disliked the change. Certainly he seemed for the\\nmoment more normally adult than ever before. Perhaps the marriage\\nwas a good thingâ\\x80\\x94might not the change of dependence form a start\\ntoward actual neutralization , leading ultimately to responsible\\nindependence? He came alone, for Asenath was very busy. She had brought\\na vast store of books and apparatus from Innsmouth (Derby shuddered\\nas he spoke the name), and was finishing the restoration of the\\nCrowninshield house and grounds.\\n\\nHer home inâ\\x80\\x94that townâ\\x80\\x94was a rather disgusting place, but certain\\nobjects in it had taught him some surprizing things. He was progressing\\nfast in esoteric lore now that he had Asenath\\'s guidance. Some of the\\nexperiments she proposed were very daring and radicalâ\\x80\\x94he did not\\nfeel at liberty to describe themâ\\x80\\x94but he had confidence in her powers\\nand intentions. The three servants were very queerâ\\x80\\x94an incredibly\\naged couple who had been with old Ephraim and referred occasionally\\nto him and to Asenath\\'s dead mother in a cryptic way, and a swarthy\\nyoung wench who had marked anomalies of feature and seemed to exude a\\nperpetual odor of fish.\\n\\n3\\n\\nFor the next two years I saw less and less of Derby. A fortnight would\\nsometimes slip by without the familiar three-and-two strokes at the\\nfront door; and when he did callâ\\x80\\x94or when, as happened with increasing\\ninfrequency, I called on himâ\\x80\\x94he was very little disposed to converse\\non vital topics. He had become secretive about those occult studies\\nwhich he used to describe and discuss so minutely, and preferred not\\nto talk of his wife. She had aged tremendously since her marriage,\\ntill nowâ\\x80\\x94oddly enoughâ\\x80\\x94she seemed the elder of the two. Her face held\\nthe most concentratedly determined expression I had ever seen, and her\\nwhole aspect seemed to gain a vague, unplaceable repulsiveness. My wife\\nand son noticed it as much as I, and we all ceased gradually to call\\non herâ\\x80\\x94for which, Edward admitted in one of his boyishly tactless\\nmoments, she was unmitigatedly grateful. Occasionally the Derbys would\\ngo on long tripsâ\\x80\\x94ostensibly to Europe, though Edward sometimes hinted\\nat obscurer destinations.\\n\\nIt was after the first year that people began talking about the change\\nin Edward Derby. It was very casual talk, for the change was purely\\npsychological; but it brought up some interesting points. Now and then,\\nit seemed, Edward was observed to wear an expression and to do things\\nwholly incompatible with his usual flabby nature. For exampleâ\\x80\\x94although\\nin the old days he could not drive a car, he was now seen occasionally\\nto dash into or out of the old Crowninshield driveway with Asenath\\'s\\npowerful Packard, handling it like a master, and meeting traffic\\nentanglements with a skill and determination utterly alien to his\\naccustomed nature. In such cases he seemed always to be just back from\\nsome trip or just starting on oneâ\\x80\\x94what sort of trip, no one could\\nguess, although he mostly favored the Innsmouth road.\\n\\nOddly, the metamorphosis did not seem altogether pleasing. People said\\nhe looked too much like his wife, or like old Ephraim Waite himself,\\nin these momentsâ\\x80\\x94or perhaps these moments seemed unnatural because\\nthey were so rare. Sometimes, hours after starting out in this way, he\\nwould return listlessly sprawled on the rear seat of the car while an\\nobviously hired chauffeur or mechanic drove. Also, his preponderant\\naspect on the streets or during his decreasing round of social contacts\\n(including, I may say, his calls on me) was the old-time indecisive\\noneâ\\x80\\x94its irresponsible childishness even more marked than in the past.\\nWhile Asenath\\'s face aged, Edward\\'sâ\\x80\\x94aside from those exceptional\\noccasionsâ\\x80\\x94actually relaxed into a kind of exaggerated immaturity, save\\nwhen a trace of the new sadness or understanding would flash across it.\\nIt was really very puzzling. Meanwhile the Derbys almost dropped out of\\nthe gay college circleâ\\x80\\x94not through their own disgust, we heard, but\\nbecause something about their present studies shocked even the most\\ncallous of the other decadents.\\n\\nIt was in the third year of the marriage that Edward began to hint\\nopenly to me of a certain fear and dissatisfaction. He would let fall\\nremarks about things \"going too far\", and would talk darkly about the\\nneed of \"gaining his identity\". At first I ignored such references, but\\nin time I began to question him guardedly, remembering what my friend\\'s\\ndaughter had said about Asenath\\'s hypnotic influence over the other\\ngirls at schoolâ\\x80\\x94the cases where students had thought they were in her\\nbody looking across the room at themselves. This questioning seemed to\\nmake him at once alarmed and grateful, and once he mumbled something\\nabout having a serious talk with me later.\\n\\nAbout this time old Mr. Derby died, for which I was afterward very\\nthankful. Edward was badly upset, though by no means disorganized.\\nHe had seen astonishingly little of his parent since his marriage,\\nfor Asenath had concentrated in herself all his vital sense of family\\nlinkage. Some called him callous in his lossâ\\x80\\x94especially since those\\njaunty and confident moods with the car began to increase. He now\\nwished to move back into the old family mansion, but Asenath insisted\\non staying in the Crowninshield house, to which she had become well\\nadjusted.\\n\\nNot long afterward my wife heard a curious thing from a friendâ\\x80\\x94one\\nof the few who had not dropped the Derbys. She had been out to the\\nend of High Street to call on the couple, and had seen a car shoot\\nbriskly out of the drive with Edward\\'s oddly confident and almost\\nsneering face above the wheel. Ringing the bell, she had been told by\\nthe repulsive wench that Asenath was also out; but had chanced to look\\nup at the house in leaving. There, at one of Edward\\'s library windows,\\nshe had glimpsed a hastily withdrawn faceâ\\x80\\x94a face whose expression\\nof pain, defeat, and wistful hopelessness was poignant beyond\\ndescription. It wasâ\\x80\\x94incredibly enough in view of its usual domineering\\ncastâ\\x80\\x94Asenath\\'s; yet the caller had vowed that in that instant the sad,\\nmuddled eyes of poor Edward were gazing out from it.\\n\\nEdward\\'s calls now grew a trifle more frequent, and his hints\\noccasionally became concrete. What he said was not to be believed,\\neven in centuried and legend-haunted Arkham; but he threw out his\\ndark lore with a sincerity and convincingness which made one fear\\nfor his sanity. He talked about terrible meetings in lonely places,\\nof cyclopean ruins in the heart of the Maine woods beneath which vast\\nstaircases led down to abysses of nighted secrets, of complex angles\\nthat led through invisible walls to other regions of space and time,\\nand of hideous exchanges of personality that permitted explorations\\nin remote and forbidden places, on other worlds, and in different\\nspace-time continua.\\n\\nHe would now and then back up certain crazy hints by exhibiting objects\\nwhich utterly nonplussed meâ\\x80\\x94elusively colored and bafflingly textured\\nobjects like nothing ever heard of on earth, whose insane curves and\\nsurfaces answered no conceivable purpose and followed no conceivable\\ngeometry. These things, he said, came \"from outside\"; and his wife knew\\nhow to get them. Sometimesâ\\x80\\x94but always in frightened and ambiguous\\nwhispersâ\\x80\\x94he would suggest things about old Ephraim Waite, whom he\\nhad seen occasionally at the college library in the old days. These\\nadumbrations were never specific, but seemed to revolve around some\\nespecially horrible doubt as to whether the old wizard were really\\ndeadâ\\x80\\x94in a spiritual as well as corporeal sense.\\n\\nAt times Derby would halt abruptly in his revelations, and I wondered\\nwhether Asenath could possibly have divined his speech at a distance\\nand cut him off through some unknown sort of telepathic mesmerismâ\\x80\\x94some\\npower of the kind she had displayed at school. Certainly, she suspected\\nthat he told me things, for as the weeks passed she tried to stop his\\nvisits with words and glances of a most inexplicable potency. Only with\\ndifficulty could he get to see me, for although he would pretend to be\\ngoing somewhere else, some invisible force would generally clog his\\nmotions or make him forget his destination for the time being. His\\nvisits usually came when Asenath was awayâ\\x80\\x94\"away in her own body,\" as\\nhe once oddly put it. She always found out laterâ\\x80\\x94the servants watched\\nhis goings and comingsâ\\x80\\x94but evidently she thought it inexpedient to do\\nanything drastic.\\n\\n4\\n\\nDerby had been married more than three years on that August day when I\\ngot that telegram from Maine. I had not seen him for two months, but\\nhad heard he was away \"on business\". Asenath was supposed to be with\\nhim, though watchful gossip declared there was someone upstairs in\\nthe house behind the doubly curtained windows. They had watched the\\npurchases made by the servants. And now the town marshal of Chesuncook\\nhad wired of the draggled madman who stumbled out of the woods with\\ndelirious ravings and screamed to me for protection. It was Edwardâ\\x80\\x94and\\nhe had been just able to recall his own name and address.\\n\\nChesuncook is close to the wildest, deepest, and least explored forest\\nbelt in Maine, and it took a whole day of feverish jolting through\\nfantastic and forbidding scenery to get there in a car. I found Derby\\nin a cell at the town farm, vacillating between frenzy and apathy. He\\nknew me at once, and began pouring out a meaningless, half-incoherent\\ntorrent of words in my direction.\\n\\n\"Danâ\\x80\\x94for God\\'s sake! The pit of the shoggoths! Down the six thousand\\nsteps ... the abomination of abominations.... I never would let her\\ntake me, and then I found myself thereâ\\x80\\x94IÃ¤! Shub-Niggurath!â\\x80\\x94The shape\\nrose up from the altar, and there were five hundred that howledâ\\x80\\x94the\\nHooded Thing bleated \\'Kamog! Kamog!\\'â\\x80\\x94that was old Ephraim\\'s secret\\nname in the covenâ\\x80\\x94I was there, where she promised she wouldn\\'t take\\nmeâ\\x80\\x94A minute before I was locked in the library, and then I was there\\nwhere she had gone with my bodyâ\\x80\\x94in the place of utter blasphemy, the\\nunholy pit where the black realm begins and the watcher guards the\\ngateâ\\x80\\x94I saw a shoggothâ\\x80\\x94it changed shapeâ\\x80\\x94I can\\'t stand itâ\\x80\\x94I\\'ll kill\\nher if she ever sends me there againâ\\x80\\x94I\\'ll kill that entityâ\\x80\\x94her, him,\\nitâ\\x80\\x94I\\'ll kill it! I\\'ll kill it with my own hands!\"\\n\\n\"The pit of the shoggoths! Down the six thousand steps ... the abomination of abominations.\"\\n\\nIt took me an hour to quiet him, but he subsided at last. The next\\nday I got him decent clothes in the village, and set out with him\\nfor Arkham. His fury of hysteria was spent, and he was inclined to\\nbe silent, though he began muttering darkly to himself when the car\\npassed through Augustaâ\\x80\\x94as if the sight of a city aroused unpleasant\\nmemories. It was clear that he did not wish to go home; and considering\\nthe fantastic delusions he seemed to have about his wifeâ\\x80\\x94delusions\\nundoubtedly springing from some actual hypnotic ordeal to which he had\\nbeen subjectedâ\\x80\\x94I thought it would be better if he did not. I would, I\\nresolved, put him up myself for a time, no matter what unpleasantness\\nit would make with Asenath. Later I would help him get a divorce, for\\nmost assuredly there were mental factors which made this marriage\\nsuicidal for him. When we struck open country again Derby\\'s muttering\\nfaded away, and I let him nod and drowse on the seat beside me as I\\ndrove.\\n\\nDuring our sunset dash through Portland the muttering commenced again,\\nmore distinctly than before, and as I listened I caught a stream of\\nutterly insane drivel about Asenath. The extent to which she had\\npreyed on Edward\\'s nerves was plain, for he had woven a whole set\\nof hallucinations around her. His present predicament, he mumbled\\nfurtively, was only one of a long series. She was getting hold of him,\\nand he knew that some day she would never let go. Even now she probably\\nlet him go only when she had to, because she couldn\\'t hold on long at\\na time. She constantly took his body and went to nameless places for\\nnameless rites, leaving him in her body and locking him upstairsâ\\x80\\x94but\\nsometimes she couldn\\'t hold on, and he would find himself suddenly in\\nhis own body again in some far-off, horrible and perhaps unknown place.\\nSometimes she\\'d get hold of him again and sometimes she couldn\\'t. Often\\nhe was left stranded somewhere as I had found him; time and again he\\nhad to find his way home from frightful distances, getting somebody to\\ndrive the car after he found it.\\n\\nThe worst thing was that she was holding on to him longer and longer\\nat a time. She wanted to be a manâ\\x80\\x94to be fully humanâ\\x80\\x94that was why she\\ngot hold of him. She had sensed the mixture of fine-wrought brain and\\nweak will in him. Some day she would crowd him out and disappear with\\nhis bodyâ\\x80\\x94disappear to become a great magician like her father and\\nleave him marooned in that female shell that wasn\\'t even quite human.\\nYes, he knew about the Innsmouth blood now. There had been traffic with\\nthings from the seaâ\\x80\\x94it was horrible.... And old Ephraimâ\\x80\\x94he had known\\nthe secret, and when he grew old did a hideous thing to keep aliveâ\\x80\\x94he\\nwanted to live for everâ\\x80\\x94Asenath would succeedâ\\x80\\x94one successful\\ndemonstration had taken place already.\\n\\nAs Derby muttered on I turned to look at him closely, verifying\\nthe impression of change which an earlier scrutiny had given me.\\nParadoxically, he seemed in better shape than usualâ\\x80\\x94harder, more\\nnormally developed, and without the trace of sickly flabbiness caused\\nby his indolent habits. It was as if he had been really active\\nand properly exercised for the first time in his coddled life, and\\nI judged that Asenath\\'s force must have pushed him into unwonted\\nchannels of motion and alertness. But just now his mind was in a\\npitiable state; for he was mumbling wild extravagances about his wife,\\nabout black magic, about old Ephraim, and about some revelation which\\nwould convince even me. He repeated names which I recognized from\\nbygone browsings in forbidden volumes, and at times made me shudder\\nwith a certain thread of mythological consistencyâ\\x80\\x94of convincing\\ncoherenceâ\\x80\\x94which ran through his maundering. Again and again he would\\npause, as if to gather courage for some final and terrible disclosure.\\n\\n\"Dan, Dan, don\\'t you remember himâ\\x80\\x94the wild eyes and the unkempt beard\\nthat never turned white? He glared at me once, and I never forgot\\nit. Now she glares that way. And I know why! He found it in the Necronomicon â\\x80\\x94the formula. I don\\'t dare tell you the page yet, but\\nwhen I do you can read and understand. Then you will know what has\\nengulfed me. On, on, on, onâ\\x80\\x94body to body to bodyâ\\x80\\x94he means never to\\ndie. The life-glowâ\\x80\\x94he knows how to break the link ... it can flicker\\non a while even when the body is dead. I\\'ll give you hints and maybe\\nyou\\'ll guess. Listen, Danâ\\x80\\x94do you know why my wife always takes\\nsuch pains with that silly back-hand writing? Have you ever seen a\\nmanuscript of old Ephraim\\'s? Do you want to know why I shivered when I\\nsaw some hasty notes Asenath had jotted down?\\n\\n\"Asenathâ\\x80\\x94 is there such a person? Why did they half think there was\\npoison in old Ephraim\\'s stomach? Why do the Gilmans whisper about the\\nway he shriekedâ\\x80\\x94like a frightened childâ\\x80\\x94when he went mad and Asenath\\nlocked him up in the padded attic room whereâ\\x80\\x94the otherâ\\x80\\x94had been? Was it old Ephraim\\'s soul that was locked in? Who locked in whom? Why had he been looking for months for someone with a fine mind and a\\nweak will? Why did he curse that his daughter wasn\\'t a son? Tell me,\\nDaniel Uptonâ\\x80\\x94 what devilish exchange was perpetrated in the house of\\nhorror where that blasphemous monster had his trusting, weak-willed,\\nhalf-human child at his mercy? Didn\\'t he make it permanentâ\\x80\\x94as she\\'ll\\ndo in the end with me? Tell me why that thing that calls itself Asenath\\nwrites differently off guard, so that you can\\'t tell its script\\nfrom â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94\"\\n\\nThen the thing happened. Derby\\'s voice was rising to a thin treble\\nscream as he raved, when suddenly it was shut off with an almost\\nmechanical click. I thought of those other occasions at my home when\\nhis confidences had abruptly ceasedâ\\x80\\x94when I had half fancied that some\\nobscure telepathic wave of Asenath\\'s mental force was intervening to\\nkeep him silent. This, though, was something altogether differentâ\\x80\\x94and,\\nI felt, infinitely more horrible. The face beside me was twisted almost\\nunrecognizably for a moment, while through the whole body there passed\\na shivering motionâ\\x80\\x94as if all the bones, organs, muscles, nerves, and\\nglands were re-adjusting themselves to a radically different posture,\\nset of stresses, and general personality.\\n\\nJust where the supreme horror lay, I could not for my life tell;\\nyet there swept over me such a swamping wave of sickness and\\nrepulsionâ\\x80\\x94such a freezing, petrifying sense of utter alienage and\\nabnormalityâ\\x80\\x94that my grasp of the wheel grew feeble and uncertain. The\\nfigure beside me seemed less like a life-long friend than like some\\nmonstrous intrusion from outer spaceâ\\x80\\x94some damnable, utterly accursed\\nfocus of unknown and malign cosmic forces.\\n\\nI had faltered only a moment, but before another moment was over my\\ncompanion had seized the wheel and forced me to change places with him.\\nThe dusk was now very thick, and the lights of Portland far behind; so\\nI could not see much of his face. The blaze of his eyes, though, was\\nphenomenal; and I knew that he must now be in that queerly energized\\nstateâ\\x80\\x94so unlike his usual selfâ\\x80\\x94which so many people had noticed. It\\nseemed odd and incredible that listless Edward Derbyâ\\x80\\x94he who could\\nnever assert himself, and who had never learned to driveâ\\x80\\x94should be\\nordering me about and taking the wheel of my own car; yet that was\\nprecisely what had happened. He did not speak for some time, and in my\\ninexplicable horror I was glad he did not.\\n\\nIn the lights of Biddeford and Saco I saw his firmly set mouth, and\\nshivered at the blaze of his eyes. The people were rightâ\\x80\\x94he did look\\ndamnably like his wife and like old Ephraim when in these moods. I did\\nnot wonder that the moods were dislikedâ\\x80\\x94there was certainly something\\nunnatural in them, and I felt the sinister element all the more because\\nof the wild ravings I had been hearing. This man, for all my life-long\\nknowledge of Edward Pickman Derby, was a strangerâ\\x80\\x94an intrusion of some\\nsort from the black abyss.\\n\\nHe did not speak until we were on a dark stretch of road, and when he\\ndid his voice seemed utterly unfamiliar. It was deeper, firmer, and\\nmore decisive than I had ever known it to be; while its accent and\\npronunciation were altogether changedâ\\x80\\x94though vaguely, remotely, and\\nrather disturbingly recalling something I could not quite place. There\\nwas, I thought, a trace of very profound and very genuine irony in the\\ntimbreâ\\x80\\x94not the flashy, meaninglessly jaunty pseudo-irony of the callow\\n\"sophisticate\", which Derby had habitually affected, but something\\ngrim, basic, pervasive, and potentially evil. I marveled at the\\nself-possession so soon following the spell of panic-struck muttering.\\n\\n\"I hope you\\'ll forget my attack back there, Upton,\" he was saying. \"You\\nknow what my nerves are, and I guess you can excuse such things. I\\'m\\nenormously grateful, of course, for this lift home.\\n\\n\"And you must forget, too, any crazy things I may have been saying\\nabout my wifeâ\\x80\\x94and about things in general. That\\'s what comes from\\noverstudy in a field like mine. My philosophy is full of bizarre\\nconcepts, and when the mind gets worn out it cooks up all sorts of\\nimaginary concrete applications. I shall take a rest from now onâ\\x80\\x94you\\nprobably won\\'t see me for some time, and you needn\\'t blame Asenath for\\nit.\\n\\n\"This trip was a bit queer, but it\\'s really very simple. There are\\ncertain Indian relics in the north woodsâ\\x80\\x94standing stones, and all\\nthatâ\\x80\\x94which mean a good deal in folklore, and Asenath and I are\\nfollowing that stuff up. It was a hard search, so I seem to have gone\\noff my head. I must send somebody for the car when I get home. A\\nmonth\\'s relaxation will put me on my feet.\"\\n\\nI do not recall just what my own part of the conversation was, for the\\nbaffling alienage of my seatmate filled all my consciousness. With\\nevery moment my feeling of elusive cosmic horror increased, till at\\nlength I was in a virtual delirium of longing for the end of the drive.\\nDerby did not offer to relinquish the wheel, and I was glad of the\\nspeed with which Portsmouth and Newburyport flashed by.\\n\\nAt the junction where the main highway runs inland and avoids\\nInnsmouth, I was half afraid my driver would take the bleak shore road\\nthat goes through that damnable place. He did not, however, but darted\\nrapidly past Rowley and Ipswich toward our destination. We reached\\nArkham before midnight, and found the lights still on at the old\\nCrowninshield house. Derby left the car with a hasty repetition of his\\nthanks, and I drove home alone with a curious feeling of relief. It had\\nbeen a terrible driveâ\\x80\\x94all the more terrible because I could not quite\\ntell whyâ\\x80\\x94and I did not regret Derby\\'s forecast of a long absence from\\nmy company.\\n\\n5\\n\\nThe next two months were full of rumors. People spoke of seeing Derby\\nmore and more in his new energized state, and Asenath was scarcely\\never in to her callers. I had only one visit from Edward, when he\\ncalled briefly in Asenath\\'s carâ\\x80\\x94duly reclaimed from wherever he had\\nleft it in Maineâ\\x80\\x94to get some books he had lent me. He was in his new\\nstate, and paused only long enough for some evasively polite remarks.\\nIt was plain that he had nothing to discuss with me when in this\\nconditionâ\\x80\\x94and I noticed that he did not even trouble to give the old\\nthree-and-two signal when ringing the door-bell. As on that evening\\nin the car, I felt a faint, infinitely deep horror which I could not\\nexplain; so that his swift departure was a prodigious relief.\\n\\nIn mid-September Derby was away for a week, and some of the decadent\\ncollege set talked knowingly of the matterâ\\x80\\x94hinting at a meeting\\nwith a notorious cult-leader, lately expelled from England, who had\\nestablished head-quarters in New York. For my part I could not get\\nthat strange ride from Maine out of my head. The transformation I had\\nwitnessed had affected me profoundly, and I caught myself again and\\nagain trying to account for the thingâ\\x80\\x94and for the extreme horror it\\nhad inspired in me.\\n\\nBut the oddest rumors were those about the sobbing in the old\\nCrowninshield house. The voice seemed to be a woman\\'s, and some of the\\nyounger people thought it sounded like Asenath\\'s. It was heard only\\nat rare intervals, and would sometimes be choked off as if by force.\\nThere was talk of an investigation, but this was dispelled one day when\\nAsenath appeared in the streets and chatted in a sprightly way with a\\nlarge number of acquaintancesâ\\x80\\x94apologizing for her recent absence and\\nspeaking incidentally about the nervous breakdown and hysteria of a\\nguest from Boston. The guest was never seen, but Asenath\\'s appearance\\nleft nothing to be said. And then someone complicated matters by\\nwhispering that the sobs had once or twice been in a man\\'s voice.\\n\\nOne evening in mid-October I heard the familiar three-and-two ring at\\nthe front door. Answering it myself, I found Edward on the steps, and\\nsaw in a moment that his personality was the old one which I had not\\nencountered since the day of his ravings on that terrible ride from\\nChesuncook. His face was twitching with a mixture of odd emotions\\nin which fear and triumph seemed to share dominion, and he looked\\nfurtively over his shoulder as I closed the door behind him.\\n\\nFollowing me clumsily to the study, he asked for some whisky to\\nsteady his nerves. I forbore to question him, but waited till he felt\\nlike beginning whatever he wanted to say. At length he ventured some\\ninformation in a choking voice.\\n\\n\"Asenath has gone, Dan. We had a long talk last night while the\\nservants were out, and I made her promise to stop preying on me. Of\\ncourse I had certainâ\\x80\\x94certain occult defenses I never told you about.\\nShe had to give in, but got frightfully angry. Just packed up and\\nstarted for New Yorkâ\\x80\\x94walked right out to catch the 8:20 in to Boston.\\nI suppose people will talk, but I can\\'t help that. You needn\\'t mention\\nthat there was any troubleâ\\x80\\x94just say she\\'s gone on a long research trip.\\n\\n\"She\\'s probably going to stay with one of her horrible groups of\\ndevotees. I hope she\\'ll go west and get a divorceâ\\x80\\x94anyhow, I\\'ve made\\nher promise to keep away and let me alone. It was horrible, Danâ\\x80\\x94she\\nwas stealing my bodyâ\\x80\\x94crowding me outâ\\x80\\x94making a prisoner of me. I lay\\nlow and pretended to let her do it, but I had to be on the watch. I\\ncould plan if I was careful, for she can\\'t read my mind literally, or\\nin detail. All she could read of my planning was a sort of general mood\\nof rebellionâ\\x80\\x94and she always thought I was helpless. Never thought I\\ncould get the best of her ... but I had a spell or two that worked.\"\\n\\nDerby looked over his shoulder and took some more whisky.\\n\\n\"I paid off those damned servants this morning when they got back.\\nThey were ugly about it, and asked questions, but they went. They\\'re\\nher kindâ\\x80\\x94Innsmouth peopleâ\\x80\\x94and were hand and glove with her. I hope\\nthey\\'ll let me aloneâ\\x80\\x94I didn\\'t like the way they laughed when they\\nwalked away. I must get as many of Dad\\'s old servants again as I can.\\nI\\'ll move back home now.\\n\\n\"I suppose you think I\\'m crazy, Danâ\\x80\\x94but Arkham history ought to hint\\nat things that back up what I\\'ve told youâ\\x80\\x94and what I\\'m going to tell\\nyou. You\\'ve seen one of the changes, tooâ\\x80\\x94in your car after I told you\\nabout Asenath that day coming home from Maine. That was when she got\\nmeâ\\x80\\x94drove me out of my body. The last thing I remember was when I was\\nall worked up trying to tell you what that she-devil is . Then she\\ngot me, and in a flash I was back at the houseâ\\x80\\x94in the library where\\nthose damned servants had me locked upâ\\x80\\x94and in that cursed fiend\\'s\\nbody ... that isn\\'t even human.... You know it was she you must have\\nridden home withâ\\x80\\x94that preying wolf in my bodyâ\\x80\\x94you ought to have known\\nthe difference!\"\\n\\nI shuddered as Derby paused. Surely, I had known the differenceâ\\x80\\x94yet\\ncould I accept an explanation as insane as this? But my distracted\\ncaller was growing even wilder.\\n\\n\"I had to save myselfâ\\x80\\x94I had to, Dan! She\\'d have got me for good at\\nHallowmassâ\\x80\\x94they hold a Sabbat up there beyond Chesuncook, and the\\nsacrifice would have clinched things. She\\'d have got me for goodâ\\x80\\x94she\\'d\\nhave been I, and I\\'d have been sheâ\\x80\\x94for everâ\\x80\\x94too lateâ\\x80\\x94My body\\'d have\\nbeen hers for goodâ\\x80\\x94She\\'d have been a man, and fully human, just as she\\nwanted to beâ\\x80\\x94I suppose she\\'d have put me out of the wayâ\\x80\\x94killed her\\nown ex-body with me in it, damn her, just as she did before â\\x80\\x94just as\\nshe, he, or it did beforeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94\"\\n\\nEdward\\'s face was now atrociously distorted, and he bent it\\nuncomfortably close to mine as his voice fell to a whisper.\\n\\n\"You must know what I hinted in the carâ\\x80\\x94 that she isn\\'t Asenath at\\nall, but really old Ephraim himself . I suspected it a year and a half\\nago, and I know it now. Her handwriting shows it when she goes off\\nguardâ\\x80\\x94sometimes she jots down a note in writing that\\'s just like her\\nfather\\'s manuscripts, stroke for strokeâ\\x80\\x94and sometimes she says things\\nthat nobody but an old man like Ephraim could say. He changed forms\\nwith her when he felt death comingâ\\x80\\x94she was the only one he could find\\nwith the right kind of brain and a weak enough willâ\\x80\\x94he got her body\\npermanently, just as she almost got mine, and then poisoned the old\\nbody he\\'d put her into. Haven\\'t you seen old Ephraim\\'s soul glaring out\\nof that she-devil\\'s eyes dozens of timesâ\\x80\\x94and out of mine when she has\\ncontrol of my body?\"\\n\\nThe whisperer was panting, and paused for breath. I said nothing, and\\nwhen he resumed, his voice was nearer normal. This, I reflected, was\\na case for the asylum, but I would not be the one to send him there.\\nPerhaps time and freedom from Asenath would do its work. I could see\\nthat he would never wish to dabble in morbid occultism again.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tell you more laterâ\\x80\\x94I must have a long rest now. I\\'ll tell you\\nsomething of the forbidden horrors she led me intoâ\\x80\\x94something of the\\nage-old horrors that even now are festering in out-of-the-way corners\\nwith a few monstrous priests to keep them alive. Some people know\\nthings about the universe that nobody ought to know, and can do things\\nthat nobody ought to be able to do. I\\'ve been in it up to my neck, but\\nthat\\'s the end. Today I\\'d burn that damned Necronomicon and all the\\nrest if I were librarian at Miskatonic.\\n\\n\"But she can\\'t get me now. I must get out of that accursed house as\\nsoon as I can, and settle down at home. You\\'ll help me, I know, if I\\nneed help. Those devilish servants, you knowâ\\x80\\x94and if people should\\nget too inquisitive about Asenath. You see, I can\\'t give them her\\naddress.... Then there are certain groups of searchersâ\\x80\\x94certain cults,\\nyou knowâ\\x80\\x94that might misunderstand our breaking up ... some of them\\nhave damnably curious ideas and methods. I know you\\'ll stand by me if\\nanything happensâ\\x80\\x94even if I have to tell you a lot that will shock\\nyou....\"\\n\\nI had Edward stay and sleep in one of the guest-chambers that night,\\nand in the morning he seemed calmer. We discussed certain possible\\narrangements for his moving back into the Derby mansion, and I hoped he\\nwould lose no time in making the change.\\n\\nHe did not call the next evening, but I saw him frequently during\\nthe ensuing weeks. We talked as little as possible about strange and\\nunpleasant things, but discussed the renovation of the old Derby house,\\nand the travels which Edward promised to take with my son and me the\\nfollowing summer.\\n\\nOf Asenath we said almost nothing, for I saw that the subject was a\\npeculiarly disturbing one. Gossip, of course, was rife; but that was no\\nnovelty in connection with the strange menage at the old Crowninshield\\nhouse. One thing I did not like was what Derby\\'s banker let fall in an\\nover-expansive mood at the Miskatonic Clubâ\\x80\\x94about the checks Edward was\\nsending regularly to a Moses and Abigail Sargent and a Eunice Babson in\\nInnsmouth. That looked as if those evil-faced servants were extorting\\nsome kind of tribute from himâ\\x80\\x94yet he had not mentioned the matter to\\nme.\\n\\nI wished that the summerâ\\x80\\x94and my son\\'s Harvard vacationâ\\x80\\x94would come,\\nso that we could get Edward to Europe. He was not, I soon saw, mending\\nas rapidly as I had hoped he would; for there was something a bit\\nhysterical in his occasional exhilaration, while his moods of fright\\nand depression were altogether too frequent. The old Derby house was\\nready by December, yet Edward constantly put off moving. Though he\\nhated and seemed to fear the Crowninshield place, he was at the same\\ntime queerly enslaved by it. He could not seem to begin dismantling\\nthings, and invented every kind of excuse to postpone action. When\\nI pointed this out to him he appeared unaccountably frightened.\\nHis father\\'s old butlerâ\\x80\\x94who was there with other re-acquired\\nservantsâ\\x80\\x94told me one day that Edward\\'s occasional prowlings about the\\nhouse, and especially down cellar, looked odd and unwholesome to him. I\\nwondered if Asenath had been writing disturbing letters, but the butler\\nsaid there was no mail which could have come from her.\\n\\nIt was about Christmas that Derby broke down one evening while calling\\non me. I was steering the conversation toward next summer\\'s travels\\nwhen he suddenly shrieked and leaped up from his chair with a look of\\nshocking, uncontrollable frightâ\\x80\\x94a cosmic panic and loathing such as\\nonly the nether gulfs of nightmare could bring to any sane mind.\\n\\n\"My brain! My brain! God, Danâ\\x80\\x94it\\'s tuggingâ\\x80\\x94from\\nbeyondâ\\x80\\x94knockingâ\\x80\\x94clawingâ\\x80\\x94that she-devilâ\\x80\\x94even nowâ\\x80\\x94Ephraimâ\\x80\\x94Kamog!\\nKamog!â\\x80\\x94The pit of the shoggothsâ\\x80\\x94IÃ¤! Shub-Niggurath! The Goat with a\\nThousand Young!...\\n\\n\"The flameâ\\x80\\x94the flameâ\\x80\\x94beyond body, beyond lifeâ\\x80\\x94in the earthâ\\x80\\x94oh,\\nGod!...\"\\n\\nI pulled him back to his chair and poured some wine down his throat\\nas his frenzy sank to a dull apathy. He did not resist, but kept his\\nlips moving as if talking to himself. Presently I realized that he was\\ntrying to talk to me, and bent my ear to his mouth to catch the feeble\\nwords.\\n\\n\"â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94again, againâ\\x80\\x94she\\'s tryingâ\\x80\\x94I might have knownâ\\x80\\x94nothing can stop\\nthat force; not distance, nor magic, nor deathâ\\x80\\x94it comes and comes,\\nmostly in the nightâ\\x80\\x94I can\\'t leaveâ\\x80\\x94it\\'s horribleâ\\x80\\x94oh, God, Dan, if\\nyou only knew as I do just how horrible it is !...\"\\n\\nWhen he had slumped down into a stupor I propped him with pillows and\\nlet normal sleep overtake him. I did not call a doctor, for I knew what\\nwould be said of his sanity, and wished to give nature a chance if I\\npossibly could. He waked at midnight, and I put him to bed upstairs,\\nbut he was gone by morning. He had let himself quietly out of the\\nhouseâ\\x80\\x94and his butler, when called on the wire, said he was at home\\npacing restlessly about the library.\\n\\n6\\n\\nEdward went to pieces rapidly after that. He did not call again, but\\nI went daily to see him. He would always be sitting in his library,\\nstaring at nothing and having an air of abnormal listening . Sometimes\\nhe talked rationally, but always on trivial topics. Any mention of his\\ntrouble, of future plans, or of Asenath would send him into a frenzy.\\nHis butler said he had frightful seizures at night, during which he\\nmight eventually do himself harm.\\n\\nI had a long talk with his doctor, banker, and lawyer, and finally took\\nthe physician with two specialist colleagues to visit him. The spasms\\nthat resulted from the first questions were violent and pitiableâ\\x80\\x94and\\nthat evening a closed car took his poor struggling body to the\\nArkham Sanitarium. I was made his guardian and called on him twice\\nweeklyâ\\x80\\x94almost weeping to hear his wild shrieks, awesome whispers, and\\ndreadful, droning repetitions of such phrases as \"I had to do itâ\\x80\\x94I had\\nto do itâ\\x80\\x94it\\'ll get meâ\\x80\\x94it\\'ll get meâ\\x80\\x94down thereâ\\x80\\x94down there in the\\ndarkâ\\x80\\x94Mother! Mother! Dan! Save meâ\\x80\\x94save meâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94\"\\n\\nHow much hope of recovery there was, no one could say, but I tried\\nmy best to be optimistic. Edward must have a home if he emerged, so\\nI transferred his servants to the Derby mansion, which would surely\\nbe his sane choice. What to do about the Crowninshield place with its\\ncomplex arrangements and collections of utterly inexplicable objects I\\ncould not decide, so left it momentarily untouchedâ\\x80\\x94telling the Derby\\nhousehold to go over and dust the chief rooms once a week, and ordering\\nthe furnace man to have a fire on those days.\\n\\nThe final nightmare came before Candlemasâ\\x80\\x94heralded, in cruel irony,\\nby a false gleam of hope. One morning late in January the sanitarium\\ntelephoned to report that Edward\\'s reason had suddenly come back. His\\ncontinuous memory, they said, was badly impaired; but sanity itself was\\ncertain. Of course he must remain some time for observation, but there\\ncould be little doubt of the outcome. All going well, he would surely\\nbe free in a week.\\n\\nI hastened over in a flood of delight, but stood bewildered when a\\nnurse took me to Edward\\'s room. The patient rose to greet me, extending\\nhis hand with a polite smile; but I saw in an instant that he bore the\\nstrangely energized personality which had seemed so foreign to his own\\nnatureâ\\x80\\x94the competent personality I had found so vaguely horrible,\\nand which Edward himself had once vowed was the intruding soul of his\\nwife. There was the same blazing visionâ\\x80\\x94so like Asenath\\'s and old\\nEphraim\\'sâ\\x80\\x94and the same firm mouth! and when he spoke I could sense the\\nsame grim, pervasive irony in his voiceâ\\x80\\x94the deep irony so redolent of\\npotential evil. This was the person who had driven my car through the\\nnight five months beforeâ\\x80\\x94the person I had not seen since that brief\\ncall when he had forgotten the old-time door-bell signal and stirred\\nsuch nebulous fears in meâ\\x80\\x94and now he filled me with the same dim\\nfeeling of blasphemous alienage and ineffable cosmic hideousness.\\n\\nHe spoke affably of arrangements for releaseâ\\x80\\x94and there was nothing\\nfor me to do but assent, despite some remarkable gaps in his recent\\nmemories. Yet I felt that something was terribly, inexplicably wrong\\nand abnormal. There were horrors in this thing that I could not reach.\\nThis was a sane personâ\\x80\\x94but was it indeed the Edward Derby I had known?\\nIf not, who or what was itâ\\x80\\x94and where was Edward? Ought it to be free\\nor confinedâ\\x80\\x94or ought it to be extirpated from the face of the earth?\\nThere was a hint of the abysmally sardonic in everything the creature\\nsaidâ\\x80\\x94the Asenath-like eyes lent a special and baffling mockery to\\ncertain words about the early liberty earned by an especially close\\nconfinement ! I must have behaved very awkwardly, and was glad to beat\\na retreat.\\n\\nAll that day and the next I racked my brain over the problem. What had\\nhappened? What sort of mind looked out through those alien eyes in\\nEdward\\'s face? I could think of nothing but this dimly terrible enigma,\\nand gave up all efforts to perform my usual work. The second morning\\nthe hospital called up to say that the recovered patient was unchanged,\\nand by evening I was close to a nervous collapseâ\\x80\\x94a state I admit,\\nthough others will vow it colored my subsequent vision. I have nothing\\nto say on this point except that no madness of mine could account for all the evidence.\\n\\n7\\n\\nIt was in the nightâ\\x80\\x94after that second eveningâ\\x80\\x94that stark, utter\\nhorror burst over me and weighted my spirit with a black, clutching\\npanic from which it can never shake free. It began with a telephone\\ncall just before midnight. I was the only one up, and sleepily took\\ndown the receiver in the library. No one seemed to be on the wire,\\nand I was about to hang up and go to bed when my ear caught a very\\nfaint suspicion of sound at the other end. Was someone trying under\\ngreat difficulties to talk? As I listened I thought I heard a sort\\nof half-liquid bubbling noiseâ\\x80\\x94\" glub ... glub ... glub \"â\\x80\\x94which\\nhad an odd suggestion of inarticulate, unintelligible word and\\nsyllable divisions. I called, \"Who is it?\" But the only answer was\\n\" glub-glub ... glub-glub .\" I could only assume that the noise was\\nmechanical; but fancying that it might be a case of a broken instrument\\nable to receive but not to send, I added, \"I can\\'t hear you. Better\\nhang up and try Information.\" Immediately I heard the receiver go on\\nthe hook at the other end.\\n\\nThis, I say, was just before midnight. When that call was traced\\nafterward it was found to come from the old Crowninshield house, though\\nit was fully half a week from the housemaid\\'s day to be there. I shall\\nonly hint what was found at that houseâ\\x80\\x94the upheaval in a remote cellar\\nstoreroom, the tracks, the dirt, the hastily rifled wardrobe, the\\nbaffling marks on the telephone, the clumsily used stationery, and the\\ndetestable stench lingering over everything. The police, poor fools,\\nhave their smug little theories, and are still searching for those\\nsinister discharged servantsâ\\x80\\x94who have dropped out of sight amidst the\\npresent furor. They speak of a ghoulish revenge for things that were\\ndone, and say I was included because I was Edward\\'s best friend and\\nadviser.\\n\\nIdiots! do they fancy those brutish clowns could have forged that\\nhandwriting? Do they fancy they could have brought what later came? Are\\nthey blind to the changes in that body that was Edward\\'s? As for me, I now believe all that Edward Derby ever told me . There are horrors\\nbeyond life\\'s edge that we do not suspect, and once in a while man\\'s\\nevil prying calls them just within our range. Ephraimâ\\x80\\x94Asenathâ\\x80\\x94that\\ndevil called them in, and they engulfed Edward as they are engulfing\\nme.\\n\\nCan I be sure that I am safe? Those powers survive the life of the\\nphysical form. The next dayâ\\x80\\x94in the afternoon, when I pulled out of my\\nprostration and was able to walk and talk coherentlyâ\\x80\\x94I went to the\\nmadhouse and shot him dead for Edward\\'s and the world\\'s sake, but can I\\nbe sure till he is cremated? They are keeping the body for some silly\\nautopsies by different doctorsâ\\x80\\x94but I say he must be cremated. He must\\nbe crematedâ\\x80\\x94he who was not Edward Derby when I shot him. I shall go\\nmad if he is not, for I may be the next. But my will is not weakâ\\x80\\x94and\\nI shall not let it be undermined by the terrors I know are seething\\naround it. One lifeâ\\x80\\x94Ephraim, Asenath, and Edwardâ\\x80\\x94who now? I will\\nnot be driven out of my body ... I will not change souls with that\\nbullet-ridden lich in the madhouse!\\n\\nBut let me try to tell coherently of that final horror. I will not\\nspeak of what the police persistently ignoredâ\\x80\\x94the tales of that\\ndwarfed, grotesque, malodorous thing met by at least three wayfarers\\nin High Street just before two o\\'clock, and the nature of the single\\nfootprints in certain places. I will say only that just about two the\\ndoor-bell and knocker waked meâ\\x80\\x94door-bell and knocker both, plied\\nalternately and uncertainly in a kind of weak desperation, and each\\ntrying to keep to Edward\\'s old signal of three-and-two strokes .\\n\\nRoused from sound sleep, my mind leaped into a turmoil. Derby at the\\ndoorâ\\x80\\x94and remembering the old code! That new personality had not\\nremembered it ... was Edward suddenly back in his rightful state? Why\\nwas he here in such evident stress and haste? Had he been released\\nahead of time, or had he escaped? Perhaps, I thought as I flung on a\\nrobe and bounded downstairs, his return to his own self had brought\\nraving and violence, revoking his discharge and driving him to a\\ndesperate dash for freedom. Whatever had happened, he was good old\\nEdward again, and I would help him!\\n\\nWhen I opened the door into the elm-arched blackness a gust of\\ninsufferably fetid wind almost flung me prostrate. I choked in nausea,\\nand for a second scarcely saw the dwarfed, humped figure on the steps.\\nThe summons had been Edward\\'s, but who was this foul, stunted parody?\\nWhere had Edward had time to go? His ring had sounded only a second\\nbefore the door opened.\\n\\nThe caller had on one of Edward\\'s overcoatsâ\\x80\\x94its bottom almost touching\\nthe ground, and its sleeves rolled back yet still covering the hands.\\nOn the head was a slouch hat pulled low, while a black silk muffler\\nconcealed the face. As I stepped unsteadily forward, the figure made a\\nsemi-liquid sound like that I had heard over the telephoneâ\\x80\\x94\" glub ...\\nglub \"â\\x80\\x94and thrust at me a large, closely written paper impaled on the\\nend of a long pencil. Still reeling from the morbid and unaccountable\\nfetor, I seized the paper and tried to read it in the light from the\\ndoorway.\\n\\nBeyond question, it was in Edward\\'s script. But why had he written\\nwhen he was close enough to ringâ\\x80\\x94and why was the script so awkward,\\ncoarse and shaky? I could make out nothing in the dim half-light, so\\nedged back into the hall, the dwarf figure clumping mechanically after\\nbut pausing on the inner door\\'s threshold. The odor of this singular\\nmessenger was really appalling, and I hoped (not in vain, thank God!)\\nthat my wife would not wake and confront it.\\n\\nThen, as I read the paper, I felt my knees give under me and my vision\\ngo black.

The Horror in Clay.\\n\\nThe most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the\\nhuman mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island\\nof ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not\\nmeant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its\\nown direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing\\ntogether of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas\\nof reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either\\ngo mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace\\nand safety of a new dark age.\\n\\nTheosophists have guessed at the awesome grandeur of the cosmic cycle\\nwherein our world and human race form transient incidents. They have\\nhinted at strange survivals in terms which would freeze the blood if\\nnot masked by a bland optimism. But it is not from them that there\\ncame the single glimpse of forbidden eons which chills me when I think\\nof it and maddens me when I dream of it. That glimpse, like all dread\\nglimpses of truth, flashed out from an accidental piecing together of\\nseparated thingsâ\\x80\\x94in this case an old newspaper item and the notes of\\na dead professor. I hope that no one else will accomplish this piecing\\nout; certainly, if I live, I shall never knowingly supply a link in\\nso hideous a chain. I think that the professor, too, intended to keep\\nsilent regarding the part he knew, and that he would have destroyed his\\nnotes had not sudden death seized him.\\n\\nMy knowledge of the thing began in the winter of 1926-27 with the death\\nof my grand-uncle, George Gammell Angell, Professor Emeritus of Semitic\\nlanguages in Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island. Professor\\nAngell was widely known as an authority on ancient inscriptions, and\\nhad frequently been resorted to by the heads of prominent museums; so\\nthat his passing at the age of ninety-two may be recalled by many.\\nLocally, interest was intensified by the obscurity of the cause of\\ndeath. The professor had been stricken whilst returning from the\\nNewport boat; falling suddenly, as witnesses said, after having been\\njostled by a nautical-looking negro who had come from one of the queer\\ndark courts on the precipitous hillside which formed a short cut from\\nthe waterfront to the deceased\\'s home in Williams Street. Physicians\\nwere unable to find any visible disorder, but concluded after perplexed\\ndebate that some obscure lesion of the heart, induced by the brisk\\nascent of so steep a hill by so elderly a man, was responsible for\\nthe end. At the time I saw no reason to dissent from this dictum, but\\nlatterly I am inclined to wonderâ\\x80\\x94and more than wonder.\\n\\nAs my granduncle\\'s heir and executor, for he died a childless widower,\\nI was expected to go over his papers with some thoroughness; and for\\nthat purpose moved his entire set of files and boxes to my quarters in\\nBoston. Much of the material which I correlated will be later published\\nby the American Archeological Society, but there was one box which I\\nfound exceedingly puzzling, and which I felt much averse from showing\\nto other eyes. It had been locked, and I did not find the key till\\nit occurred to me to examine the personal ring which the professor\\ncarried always in his pocket. Then, indeed, I succeeded in opening it,\\nbut when I did so seemed only to be confronted by a greater and more\\nclosely locked barrier. For what could be the meaning of the queer clay\\nbas-relief and the disjointed jottings, ramblings, and cuttings which I\\nfound? Had my uncle, in his latter years, become credulous of the most\\nsuperficial impostures? I resolved to search out the eccentric sculptor\\nresponsible for this apparent disturbance of an old man\\'s peace of mind.\\n\\nThe bas-relief was a rough rectangle less than an inch thick and about\\nfive by six inches in area; obviously of modern origin. Its designs,\\nhowever, were far from modern in atmosphere and suggestion; for,\\nalthough the vagaries of cubism and futurism are many and wild, they do\\nnot often reproduce that cryptic regularity which lurks in prehistoric\\nwriting. And writing of some kind the bulk of these designs seemed\\ncertainly to be; though my memory, despite much familiarity with the\\npapers and collections of my uncle, failed in any way to identify this\\nparticular species, or even hint at its remotest affiliations.\\n\\nAbove these apparent hieroglyphics was a figure of evidently pictorial\\nintent, though its impressionistic execution forbade a very clear\\nidea of its nature. It seemed to be a sort of monster, or symbol\\nrepresenting a monster, of a form which only a diseased fancy could\\nconceive. If I say that my somewhat extravagant imagination yielded\\nsimultaneous pictures of an octopus, a dragon, and a human caricature,\\nI shall not be unfaithful to the spirit of the thing. A pulpy,\\ntentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentary\\nwings; but it was the general outline of the whole which made it most\\nshockingly frightful. Behind the figure was a vague suggestion of a\\nCyclopean architectural background.\\n\\nThe writing accompanying this oddity was, aside from a stack of\\npress cuttings, in Professor Angell\\'s most recent hand; and made no\\npretense to literary style. What seemed to be the main document was\\nheaded \" CTHULHU CULT \" in characters painstakingly printed to avoid\\nthe erroneous reading of a word so unheard-of. This manuscript was\\ndivided into two sections, the first of which was headed \"1925â\\x80\\x94Dream\\nand Dream Work of H. A. Wilcox, 7 Thomas St., Providence, R. I.,\" and\\nthe second, \"Narrative of Inspector John R. Legrasse, 121 Bienville\\nSt., New Orleans, La., at 1908 A. A. S. Mtgâ\\x80\\x94Notes on Same, & Prof.\\nWebb\\'s Acct.\" The other manuscript papers were all brief notes, some\\nof them accounts of the queer dreams of different persons, some of\\nthem citations from theosophical books and magazines (notably W.\\nScott-Eliott\\'s Atlantis and the Lost Lemuria ), and the rest comments\\non long-surviving secret societies and hidden cults, with references\\nto passages in such mythological and anthropological source-books\\nas Frazer\\'s Golden Bough and Miss Murray\\'s Witch-Cult in Western\\nEurope . The cuttings largely alluded to outrÃ© mental illnesses and\\noutbreaks of group folly or mania in the spring of 1925.\\n\\nThe first half of the principal manuscript told a very peculiar\\ntale. It appears that on March 1st, 1925, a thin, dark young man of\\nneurotic and excited aspect had called upon Professor Angell bearing\\nthe singular clay bas-relief, which was then exceedingly damp and\\nfresh. His card bore the name of Henry Anthony Wilcox, and my uncle\\nhad recognized him as the youngest son of an excellent family slightly\\nknown to him, who had latterly been studying sculpture at the Rhode\\nIsland School of Design and living alone at the Fleur-de-Lys Building\\nnear that institution. Wilcox was a precocious youth of known genius\\nbut great eccentricity, and had from childhood excited attention\\nthrough the strange stories and odd dreams he was in the habit of\\nrelating. He called himself \"psychically hypersensitive\", but the staid\\nfolk of the ancient commercial city dismissed him as merely \"queer\".\\nNever mingling much with his kind, he had dropped gradually from social\\nvisibility, and was now known only to a small group of esthetes from\\nother towns. Even the Providence Art Club, anxious to preserve its\\nconservatism, had found him quite hopeless.\\n\\nOn the occasion of the visit, ran the professor\\'s manuscript, the\\nsculptor abruptly asked for the benefit of his host\\'s archeological\\nknowledge in identifying the hieroglyphics on the bas-relief. He\\nspoke in a dreamy, stilted manner which suggested pose and alienated\\nsympathy; and my uncle showed some sharpness in replying, for the\\nconspicuous freshness of the tablet implied kinship with anything but\\narcheology. Young Wilcox\\'s rejoinder, which impressed my uncle enough\\nto make him recall and record it verbatim, was of a fantastically\\npoetic cast which must have typified his whole conversation, and which\\nI have since found highly characteristic of him. He said, \"It is new,\\nindeed, for I made it last night in a dream of strange cities; and\\ndreams are older than brooding Tyre, or the contemplative Sphinx, or\\ngarden-girdled Babylon.\"\\n\\nIt was then that he began that rambling tale which suddenly played upon\\na sleeping memory and won the fevered interest of my uncle. There had\\nbeen a slight earthquake tremor the night before, the most considerable\\nfelt in New England for some years; and Wilcox\\'s imagination had been\\nkeenly affected. Upon retiring, he had had an unprecedented dream of\\ngreat Cyclopean cities of Titan blocks and sky-flung monoliths, all\\ndripping with green ooze and sinister with latent horror. Hieroglyphics\\nhad covered the walls and pillars, and from some undetermined point\\nbelow had come a voice that was not a voice; a chaotic sensation which\\nonly fancy could transmute into sound, but which he attempted to render\\nby the almost unpronounceable jumble of letters, \" Cthulhu fhtagn \".\\n\\nThis verbal jumble was the key to the recollection which excited and\\ndisturbed Professor Angell. He questioned the sculptor with scientific\\nminuteness; and studied with almost frantic intensity the bas-relief\\non which the youth had found himself working, chilled and clad only\\nin his nightclothes, when waking had stolen bewilderingly over him.\\nMy uncle blamed his old age, Wilcox afterward said, for his slowness\\nin recognizing both hieroglyphics and pictorial design. Many of his\\nquestions seemed highly out of place to his visitor, especially those\\nwhich tried to connect the latter with strange cults or societies;\\nand Wilcox could not understand the repeated promises of silence\\nwhich he was offered in exchange for an admission of membership in\\nsome widespread mystical or paganly religious body. When Professor\\nAngell became convinced that the sculptor was indeed ignorant of any\\ncult or system of cryptic lore, he besieged his visitor with demands\\nfor future reports of dreams. This bore regular fruit, for after the\\nfirst interview the manuscript records daily calls of the young man,\\nduring which he related startling fragments of nocturnal imagery whose\\nburden was always some terrible Cyclopean vista of dark and dripping\\nstone, with a subterrene voice or intelligence shouting monotonously\\nin enigmatical sense-impacts uninscribable save as gibberish. The two\\nsounds most frequently repeated are those rendered by the letters\\n\" Cthulhu \" and \" R\\'lyeh \".\\n\\nOn March 23rd, the manuscript continued, Wilcox failed to appear; and\\ninquiries at his quarters revealed that he had been stricken with an\\nobscure sort of fever and taken to the home of his family in Waterman\\nStreet. He had cried out in the night, arousing several other artists\\nin the building, and had manifested since then only alternations of\\nunconsciousness and delirium. My uncle at once telephoned the family,\\nand from that time forward kept close watch of the case; calling\\noften at the Thayer Street office of Dr. Tobey, whom he learned to\\nbe in charge. The youth\\'s febrile mind, apparently, was dwelling on\\nstrange things; and the doctor shuddered now and then as he spoke of\\nthem. They included not only a repetition of what he had formerly\\ndreamed, but touched wildly on a gigantic thing \"miles high\" which\\nwalked or lumbered about. He at no time fully described this object,\\nbut occasional frantic words, as repeated by Dr. Tobey, convinced the\\nprofessor that it must be identical with the nameless monstrosity\\nhe had sought to depict in his dream-sculpture. Reference to this\\nobject, the doctor added, was invariably a prelude to the young man\\'s\\nsubsidence into lethargy. His temperature, oddly enough, was not\\ngreatly above normal; but the whole condition was otherwise such as to\\nsuggest true fever rather than mental disorder.\\n\\nOn April 2nd at about 3 p. m. every trace of Wilcox\\'s malady suddenly\\nceased. He sat upright in bed, astonished to find himself at home and\\ncompletely ignorant of what had happened in dream or reality since the\\nnight of March 22nd. Pronounced well by his physician, he returned\\nto his quarters in three days; but to Professor Angell he was of no\\nfurther assistance. All traces of strange dreaming had vanished with\\nhis recovery, and my uncle kept no record of his night-thoughts after a\\nweek of pointless and irrelevant accounts of thoroughly usual visions.\\n\\nHere the first part of the manuscript ended, but references to certain\\nof the scattered notes gave me much material for thoughtâ\\x80\\x94so much, in\\nfact, that only the ingrained skepticism then forming my philosophy\\ncan account for my continued distrust of the artist. The notes in\\nquestion were those descriptive of the dreams of various persons\\ncovering the same period as that in which young Wilcox had had his\\nstrange visitations. My uncle, it seems, had quickly instituted a\\nprodigiously far-flung body of inquiries amongst nearly all the friends\\nwhom he could question without impertinence, asking for nightly reports\\nof their dreams, and the dates of any notable visions for some time\\npast. The reception of his request seems to have been varied; but\\nhe must, at the very least, have received more responses than any\\nordinary man could have handled without a secretary. This original\\ncorrespondence was not preserved, but his notes formed a thorough and\\nreally significant digest. Average people in society and businessâ\\x80\\x94New\\nEngland\\'s traditional \"salt of the earth\"â\\x80\\x94gave an almost completely\\nnegative result, though scattered cases of uneasy but formless\\nnocturnal impressions appear here and there, always between March\\n23rd and April 2ndâ\\x80\\x94the period of young Wilcox\\'s delirium. Scientific\\nmen were little more affected, though four cases of vague description\\nsuggest fugitive glimpses of strange landscapes, and in one case there\\nis mentioned a dread of something abnormal.\\n\\nIt was from the artists and poets that the pertinent answers came,\\nand I know that panic would have broken loose had they been able to\\ncompare notes. As it was, lacking their original letters, I half\\nsuspected the compiler of having asked leading questions, or of having\\nedited the correspondence in corroboration of what he had latently\\nresolved to see. That is why I continued to feel that Wilcox, somehow\\ncognizant of the old data which my uncle had possessed, had been\\nimposing on the veteran scientist. These responses from esthetes told\\na disturbing tale. From February 28th to April 2nd a large proportion\\nof them had dreamed very bizarre things, the intensity of the dreams\\nbeing immeasurably the stronger during the period of the sculptor\\'s\\ndelirium. Over a fourth of those who reported anything, reported\\nscenes and half-sounds not unlike those which Wilcox had described;\\nand some of the dreamers confessed acute fear of the gigantic nameless\\nthing visible toward the last. One case, which the note describes with\\nemphasis, was very sad. The subject, a widely known architect with\\nleanings toward theosophy and occultism, went violently insane on\\nthe date of young Wilcox\\'s seizure, and expired several months later\\nafter incessant screamings to be saved from some escaped denizen of\\nhell. Had my uncle referred to these cases by name instead of merely\\nby number, I should have attempted some corroboration and personal\\ninvestigation; but as it was, I succeeded in tracing down only a\\nfew. All of these, however, bore out the notes in full. I have often\\nwondered if all the objects of the professor\\'s questioning felt as\\npuzzled as did this fraction. It is well that no explanation shall ever\\nreach them.\\n\\nThe press cuttings, as I have intimated, touched on cases of panic,\\nmania, and eccentricity during the given period. Professor Angell\\nmust have employed a cutting bureau, for the number of extracts was\\ntremendous, and the sources scattered throughout the globe. Here\\nwas a nocturnal suicide in London, where a lone sleeper had leaped\\nfrom a window after a shocking cry. Here likewise a rambling letter\\nto the editor of a paper in South America, where a fanatic deduces\\na dire future from visions he has seen. A dispatch from California\\ndescribes a theosophist colony as donning white robes en masse for some\\n\"glorious fulfilment\" which never arrives, whilst items from India\\nspeak guardedly of serious native unrest toward the end of March.\\nVoodoo orgies multiply in Haiti, and African outposts report ominous\\nmutterings. American officers in the Philippines find certain tribes\\nbothersome about this time, and New York policemen are mobbed by\\nhysterical Levantines on the night of March 22-23. The west of Ireland,\\ntoo, is full of wild rumor and legendry, and a fantastic painter named\\nArdois-Bonnot hangs a blasphemous Dream Landscape in the Paris spring\\nsalon of 1926. And so numerous are the recorded troubles in insane\\nasylums that only a miracle can have stopped the medical fraternity\\nfrom noting strange parallelisms and drawing mystified conclusions.\\nA weird bunch of cuttings, all told; and I can at this date scarcely\\nenvisage the callous rationalism with which I set them aside. But I\\nwas then convinced that young Wilcox had known of the older matters\\nmentioned by the professor.\\n\\n2. The Tale of Inspector Legrasse.\\n\\nThe older matters which had made the sculptor\\'s dream and bas-relief so\\nsignificant to my uncle formed the subject of the second half of his\\nlong manuscript. Once before, it appears, Professor Angell had seen the\\nhellish outlines of the nameless monstrosity, puzzled over the unknown\\nhieroglyphics, and heard the ominous syllables which can be rendered\\nonly as \" Cthulhu \"; and all this in so stirring and horrible a\\nconnection that it is small wonder he pursued young Wilcox with queries\\nand demands for data.\\n\\nThis earlier experience had come in 1908, seventeen years before,\\nwhen the American Archeological Society held its annual meeting in\\nSt. Louis. Professor Angell, as befitted one of his authority and\\nattainments, had had a prominent part in all the deliberations; and was\\none of the first to be approached by the several outsiders who took\\nadvantage of the convocation to offer questions for correct answering\\nand problems for expert solution.\\n\\nThe chief of these outsiders, and in a short time the focus of interest\\nfor the entire meeting, was a commonplace-looking middle-aged man\\nwho had traveled all the way from New Orleans for certain special\\ninformation unobtainable from any local source. His name was John\\nRaymond Legrasse, and he was by profession an inspector of police. With\\nhim he bore the subject of his visit, a grotesque, repulsive, and\\napparently very ancient stone statuette whose origin he was at a loss\\nto determine.\\n\\nIt must not be fancied that Inspector Legrasse had the least interest\\nin archeology. On the contrary, his wish for enlightenment was prompted\\nby purely professional considerations. The statuette, idol, fetish,\\nor whatever it was, had been captured some months before in the\\nwooded swamps south of New Orleans during a raid on a supposed voodoo\\nmeeting; and so singular and hideous were the rites connected with\\nit, that the police could not but realize that they had stumbled on a\\ndark cult totally unknown to them, and infinitely more diabolic than\\neven the blackest of the African voodoo circles. Of its origin, apart\\nfrom the erratic and unbelievable tales extorted from the captured\\nmembers, absolutely nothing was to be discovered; hence the anxiety\\nof the police for any antiquarian lore which might help them to place\\nthe frightful symbol, and through it track down the cult to its\\nfountain-head.\\n\\nInspector Legrasse was scarcely prepared for the sensation which his\\noffering created. One sight of the thing had been enough to throw the\\nassembled men of science into a state of tense excitement, and they\\nlost no time in crowding around him to gaze at the diminutive figure\\nwhose utter strangeness and air of genuinely abysmal antiquity hinted\\nso potently at unopened and archaic vistas. No recognized school of\\nsculpture had animated this terrible object, yet centuries and even\\nthousands of years seemed recorded in its dim and greenish surface of\\nunplaceable stone.\\n\\nThe figure, which was finally passed slowly from man to man for close\\nand careful study, was between seven and eight inches in height, and of\\nexquisitely artistic workmanship. It represented a monster of vaguely\\nanthropoid outline, but with an octopuslike head whose face was a mass\\nof feelers, a scaly, rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws on hind\\nand fore feet, and long, narrow wings behind. This thing, which seemed\\ninstinct with a fearsome and unnatural malignancy, was of a somewhat\\nbloated corpulence, and squatted evilly on a rectangular block or\\npedestal covered with undecipherable characters. The tips of the wings\\ntouched the back edge of the block, the seat occupied the center,\\nwhilst the long, curved claws of the doubled-up, crouching hind legs\\ngripped the front edge and extended a quarter of the way down toward\\nthe bottom of the pedestal. The cephalopod head was bent forward, so\\nthat the ends of the facial feelers brushed the backs of huge forepaws\\nwhich clasped the croucher\\'s elevated knees. The aspect of the whole\\nwas abnormally lifelike, and the more subtly fearful because its source\\nwas so totally unknown. Its vast, awesome, and incalculable age was\\nunmistakable; yet not one link did it show with any known type of art\\nbelonging to civilization\\'s youthâ\\x80\\x94or indeed to any other time.\\n\\nTotally separate and apart, its very material was a mystery; for the\\nsoapy, greenish-black stone with its golden or iridescent flecks and\\nstriations resembled nothing familiar to geology or mineralogy. The\\ncharacters along the base were equally baffling; and no member present,\\ndespite a representation of half the world\\'s expert learning in this\\nfield, could form the least notion of even their remotest linguistic\\nkinship. They, like the subject and material, belonged to something\\nhorribly remote and distinct from mankind as we know it; something\\nfrightfully suggestive of old and unhallowed cycles of life in which\\nour world and our conceptions have no part.\\n\\nAnd yet, as the members severally shook their heads and confessed\\ndefeat at the inspector\\'s problem, there was one man in that gathering\\nwho suspected a touch of bizarre familiarity in the monstrous shape and\\nwriting, and who presently told with some diffidence of the odd trifle\\nhe knew. This person was the late William Channing Webb, professor of\\nanthropology in Princeton University, and an explorer of no slight note.\\n\\nProfessor Webb had been engaged, forty-eight years before, in a tour\\nof Greenland and Iceland in search of some Runic inscriptions which\\nhe failed to unearth; and whilst high up on the West Greenland coast\\nhad encountered a singular tribe or cult of degenerate Eskimos whose\\nreligion, a curious form of devil-worship, chilled him with its\\ndeliberate bloodthirstiness and repulsiveness. It was a faith of which\\nother Eskimos knew little, and which they mentioned only with shudders,\\nsaying that it had come down from horribly ancient eons before ever the\\nworld was made. Besides nameless rites and human sacrifices there were\\ncertain queer hereditary rituals addressed to a supreme elder devil or tornasuk ; and of this Professor Webb had taken a careful phonetic\\ncopy from an aged angekok or wizard-priest, expressing the sounds in\\nRoman letters as best he knew how. But just now of prime significance\\nwas the fetish which this cult had cherished, and around which they\\ndanced when the aurora leaped high over the ice cliffs. It was, the\\nprofessor stated, a very crude bas-relief of stone, comprising a\\nhideous picture and some cryptic writing. And as far as he could tell,\\nit was a rough parallel in all essential features of the bestial thing\\nnow lying before the meeting.\\n\\nThese data, received with suspense and astonishment by the assembled\\nmembers, proved doubly exciting to Inspector Legrasse; and he began at\\nonce to ply his informant with questions. Having noted and copied an\\noral ritual among the swamp cult-worshipers his men had arrested, he\\nbesought the professor to remember as best he might the syllables taken\\ndown amongst the diabolist Eskimos. There then followed an exhaustive\\ncomparison of details, and a moment of really awed silence when both\\ndetective and scientist agreed on the virtual identity of the phrase\\ncommon to two hellish rituals so many worlds of distance apart. What,\\nin substance, both the Eskimo wizards and the Louisiana swamp-priests\\nhad chanted to their kindred idols was something very like thisâ\\x80\\x94the\\nword-divisions being guessed at from traditional breaks in the phrase\\nas chanted aloud:\\n\\n\" Ph\\'nglui mglw\\'nafh Cthulhu R\\'lyeh wgah\\'nagl fhtagn. \"\\n\\nLegrasse had one point in advance of Professor Webb, for several among\\nhis mongrel prisoners had repeated to him what older celebrants had\\ntold them the words meant. This text, as given, ran something like this:\\n\\n\"In his house at R\\'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.\"\\n\\nAnd now, in response to a general urgent demand, Inspector Legrasse\\nrelated as fully as possible his experience with the swamp worshipers;\\ntelling a story to which I could see my uncle attached profound\\nsignificance. It savored of the wildest dreams of myth-maker and\\ntheosophist, and disclosed an astonishing degree of cosmic imagination\\namong such half-castes and pariahs as might be least expected to\\npossess it.\\n\\nOn November 1st, 1907, there had come to New Orleans police a frantic\\nsummons from the swamp and lagoon country to the south. The squatters\\nthere, mostly primitive but good-natured descendants of Lafitte\\'s men,\\nwere in the grip of stark terror from an unknown thing which had stolen\\nupon them in the night. It was voodoo, apparently, but voodoo of a more\\nterrible sort than they had ever known; and some of their women and\\nchildren had disappeared since the malevolent tom-tom had begun its\\nincessant beating far within the black haunted woods where no dweller\\nventured. There were insane shouts and harrowing screams, soul-chilling\\nchants and dancing devil-flames; and, the frightened messenger added,\\nthe people could stand it no more.\\n\\nSo a body of twenty police, filling two carriages and an automobile,\\nhad set out in the late afternoon with the shivering squatter as a\\nguide. At the end of the passable road they alighted, and for miles\\nsplashed on in silence through the terrible cypress woods where day\\nnever came. Ugly roots and malignant hanging nooses of Spanish moss\\nbeset them, and now and then a pile of dank stones or fragments of a\\nrotting wall intensified by its hint of morbid habitation a depression\\nwhich every malformed tree and every fungous islet combined to create.\\nAt length the squatter settlement, a miserable huddle of huts, hove in\\nsight; and hysterical dwellers ran out to cluster around the group of\\nbobbing lanterns. The muffled beat of tom-toms was now faintly audible\\nfar, far ahead; and a curdling shriek came at infrequent intervals\\nwhen the wind shifted. A reddish glare, too, seemed to filter through\\nthe pale undergrowth beyond endless avenues of forest night. Reluctant\\neven to be left alone again, each one of the cowed squatters refused\\npoint-blank to advance another inch toward the scene of unholy\\nworship, so Inspector Legrasse and his nineteen colleagues plunged on\\nunguided into black arcades of horror that none of them had ever trod\\nbefore.\\n\\nThe region now entered by the police was one of traditionally evil\\nrepute, substantially unknown and untraversed by white men. There were\\nlegends of a hidden lake unglimpsed by mortal sight, in which dwelt a\\nhuge, formless white polypous thing with luminous eyes; and squatters\\nwhispered that bat-winged devils flew up out of caverns in inner\\nearth to worship it at midnight. They said it had been there before\\nD\\'Iberville, before La Salle, before the Indians, and before even the\\nwholesome beasts and birds of the woods. It was nightmare itself, and\\nto see it was to die. But it made men dream, and so they knew enough to\\nkeep away. The present voodoo orgy was, indeed, on the merest fringe\\nof this abhorred area, but that location was bad enough; hence perhaps\\nthe very place of the worship had terrified the squatters more than the\\nshocking sounds and incidents.\\n\\nOnly poetry or madness could do justice to the noises heard by\\nLegrasse\\'s men as they plowed on through the black morass toward the\\nred glare and the muffled tom-toms. There are vocal qualities peculiar\\nto men, and vocal qualities peculiar to beasts; and it is terrible\\nto hear the one when the source should yield the other. Animal fury\\nand orgiastic license here whipped themselves to demoniac heights by\\nhowls and squawking ecstasies that tore and reverberated through those\\nnighted woods like pestilential tempests from the gulfs of hell. Now\\nand then the less organized ululations would cease, and from what\\nseemed a well-drilled chorus of hoarse voices would rise in singsong\\nchant that hideous phrase or ritual:\\n\\n\" Ph\\'nglui mglw\\'nafh Cthulhu R\\'lyeh wgah\\'nagl fhtagn. \"\\n\\nThen the men, having reached a spot where the trees were thinner, came\\nsuddenly in sight of the spectacle itself. Four of them reeled, one\\nfainted, and two were shaken into a frantic cry which the mad cacophony\\nof the orgy fortunately deadened. Legrasse dashed swamp water on the\\nface of the fainting man, and all stood trembling and nearly hypnotized\\nwith horror.\\n\\nIn a natural glade of the swamp stood a grassy island of perhaps an\\nacre\\'s extent, clear of trees and tolerably dry. On this now leaped and\\ntwisted a more indescribable horde of human abnormality than any but a\\nSime or an Angarola could paint. Void of clothing, this hybrid spawn\\nwere braying, bellowing and writhing about a monstrous ring-shaped\\nbonfire; in the center of which, revealed by occasional rifts in the\\ncurtain of flame, stood a great granite monolith some eight feet in\\nheight; on top of which, incongruous in its diminutiveness, rested the\\nnoxious carven statuette. From a wide circle of ten scaffolds set up\\nat regular intervals with the flame-girt monolith as a center hung,\\nhead downward, the oddly marred bodies of the helpless squatters who\\nhad disappeared. It was inside this circle that the ring of worshipers\\njumped and roared, the general direction of the mass motion being from\\nleft to right in endless bacchanale between the ring of bodies and the\\nring of fire.\\n\\nIt may have been only imagination and it may have been only echoes\\nwhich induced one of the men, an excitable Spaniard, to fancy he heard\\nantiphonal responses to the ritual from some far and unillumined spot\\ndeeper within the wood of ancient legendry and horror. This man, Joseph\\nD. Galvez, I later met and questioned; and he proved distractingly\\nimaginative. He indeed went so far as to hint of the faint beating of\\ngreat wings, and of a glimpse of shining eyes and a mountainous white\\nbulk beyond the remotest treesâ\\x80\\x94but I suppose he had been hearing too\\nmuch native superstition.\\n\\nActually, the horrified pause of the men was of comparatively brief\\nduration. Duty came first; and although there must have been nearly a\\nhundred mongrel celebrants in the throng, the police relied on their\\nfirearms and plunged determinedly into the nauseous rout. For five\\nminutes the resultant din and chaos were beyond description. Wild\\nblows were struck, shots were fired, and escapes were made; but in\\nthe end Legrasse was able to count some forty-seven sullen prisoners,\\nwhom he forced to dress in haste and fall into line between two rows\\nof policemen. Five of the worshipers lay dead, and two severely\\nwounded ones were carried away on improvised stretchers by their\\nfellow-prisoners. The image on the monolith, of course, was carefully\\nremoved and carried back by Legrasse.\\n\\nExamined at headquarters after a trip of intense strain and weariness,\\nthe prisoners all proved to be men of a very low, mixed-blooded, and\\nmentally aberrant type. Most were seamen, and a sprinkling of negroes\\nand mulattoes, largely West Indians or Brava Portuguese from the Cape\\nVerde Islands, gave a coloring of voodooism to the heterogeneous cult.\\nBut before many questions were asked, it became manifest that something\\nfar deeper and older than negro fetishism was involved. Degraded and\\nignorant as they were, the creatures held with surprizing consistency\\nto the central idea of their loathsome faith.\\n\\nThey worshiped, so they said, the Great Old Ones who lived ages before\\nthere were any men, and who came to the young world out of the sky.\\nThose Old Ones were gone now, inside the earth and under the sea; but\\ntheir dead bodies had told their secrets in dreams to the first man,\\nwho formed a cult which had never died. This was that cult, and the\\nprisoners said it had always existed and always would exist, hidden in\\ndistant wastes and dark places all over the world until the time when\\nthe great priest Cthulhu, from his dark house in the mighty city of\\nR\\'lyeh under the waters, should rise and bring the earth again beneath\\nhis sway. Some day he would call, when the stars were ready, and the\\nsecret cult would always be waiting to liberate him.\\n\\nMeanwhile no more must be told. There was a secret which even torture\\ncould not extract. Mankind was not absolutely alone among the conscious\\nthings of earth, for shapes came out of the dark to visit the faithful\\nfew. But these were not the Great Old Ones. No man had ever seen the\\nOld Ones. The carven idol was great Cthulhu, but none might say whether\\nor not the others were precisely like him. No one could read the old\\nwriting now, but things were told by word of mouth. The chanted ritual\\nwas not the secretâ\\x80\\x94that was never spoken aloud, only whispered. The\\nchant meant only this: \"In his house at R\\'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits\\ndreaming.\"\\n\\nOnly two of the prisoners were found sane enough to be hanged, and\\nthe rest were committed to various institutions. All denied a part\\nin the ritual murders, and averred that the killing had been done\\nby Black-winged Ones which had come to them from their immemorial\\nmeeting-place in the haunted wood. But of those mysterious allies no\\ncoherent account could ever be gained. What the police did extract\\ncame mainly from an immensely aged mestizo named Castro, who claimed\\nto have sailed to strange ports and talked with undying leaders of the\\ncult in the mountains of China.\\n\\nOld Castro remembered bits of hideous legend that paled the\\nspeculations of theosophists and made man and the world seem recent\\nand transient indeed. There had been eons when other Things ruled on\\nthe earth, and They had had great cities. Remains of Them, he said the\\ndeathless Chinamen had told him, were still to be found as Cyclopean\\nstones on islands in the Pacific. They all died vast epochs of time\\nbefore man came, but there were arts which could revive Them when the\\nstars had come round again to the right positions in the cycle of\\neternity. They had, indeed, come themselves from the stars, and brought\\nTheir images with Them.\\n\\nThese Great Old Ones, Castro continued, were not composed altogether\\nof flesh and blood. They had shapeâ\\x80\\x94for did not this star-fashioned\\nimage prove it?â\\x80\\x94but that shape was not made of matter. When the stars\\nwere right, They could plunge from world to world through the sky;\\nbut when the stars were wrong, They could not live. But although They\\nno longer lived, They would never really die. They all lay in stone\\nhouses in Their great city of R\\'lyeh, preserved by the spells of mighty\\nCthulhu for a glorious resurrection when the stars and the earth might\\nonce more be ready for Them. But at that time some force from outside\\nmust serve to liberate Their bodies. The spells that preserved Them\\nintact likewise prevented Them from making an initial move, and They\\ncould only lie awake in the dark and think whilst uncounted millions\\nof years rolled by. They knew all that was occurring in the universe,\\nfor Their mode of speech was transmitted thought. Even now They talked\\nin Their tombs. When, after infinities of chaos, the first men came,\\nthe Great Old Ones spoke to the sensitive among them by molding their\\ndreams; for only thus could Their language reach the fleshly minds of\\nmammals.\\n\\nThen, whispered Castro, those first men formed the cult around small\\nidols which the Great Ones showed them; idols brought in dim eras\\nfrom dark stars. That cult would never die till the stars came right\\nagain, and the secret priests would take great Cthulhu from His tomb\\nto revive His subjects and resume His rule of earth. The time would\\nbe easy to know, for then mankind would have become as the Great Old\\nOnes; free and wild and beyond good and evil, with laws and morals\\nthrown aside and all men shouting and killing and reveling in joy. Then\\nthe liberated Old Ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill\\nand revel and enjoy themselves, and all the earth would flame with a\\nholocaust of ecstasy and freedom. Meanwhile the cult, by appropriate\\nrites, must keep alive the memory of those ancient ways and shadow\\nforth the prophecy of their return.\\n\\nIn the elder time chosen men had talked with the entombed Old Ones in\\ndreams, but then something had happened. The great stone city R\\'lyeh,\\nwith its monoliths and sepulchers, had sunk beneath the waves; and the\\ndeep waters, full of the one primal mystery through which not even\\nthought can pass, had cut off the spectral intercourse. But memory\\nnever died, and high priests said that the city would rise again when\\nthe stars were right. Then came out of the earth the black spirits of\\nearth, moldy and shadowy, and full of dim rumors picked up in caverns\\nbeneath forgotten sea-bottoms. But of them old Castro dared not speak\\nmuch. He cut himself off hurriedly, and no amount of persuasion or\\nsubtlety could elicit more in this direction. The size of the Old\\nOnes, too, he curiously declined to mention. Of the cult, he said that\\nhe thought the center lay amid the pathless deserts of Arabia, where\\nIrem, the City of Pillars, dreams hidden and untouched. It was not\\nallied to the European witch-cult, and was virtually unknown beyond its\\nmembers. No book had ever really hinted of it, though the deathless\\nChinamen said that there were double meanings in the Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred which the initiated might read as they\\nchose, especially the much-discussed couplet:\\n\\nLegrasse, deeply impressed and not a little bewildered, had inquired\\nin vain concerning the historic affiliations of the cult. Castro,\\napparently, had told the truth when he said that it was wholly\\nsecret. The authorities at Tulane University could shed no light upon\\neither cult or image, and now the detective had come to the highest\\nauthorities in the country and met with no more than the Greenland tale\\nof Professor Webb.\\n\\nThe feverish interest aroused at the meeting by Legrasse\\'s tale,\\ncorroborated as it was by the statuette, is echoed in the subsequent\\ncorrespondence of those who attended, although scant mention occurs in\\nthe formal publication of the society. Caution is the first care of\\nthose accustomed to face occasional charlatanry and imposture. Legrasse\\nfor some time lent the image to Professor Webb, but at the latter\\'s\\ndeath it was returned to him and remains in his possession, where I\\nviewed it not long ago. It is truly a terrible thing, and unmistakably\\nakin to the dream-sculpture of young Wilcox.\\n\\nThat my uncle was excited by the tale of the sculptor I did not\\nwonder, for what thoughts must arise upon hearing, after a knowledge\\nof what Legrasse had learned of the cult, of a sensitive young man\\nwho had dreamed not only the figure and exact hieroglyphics of the\\nswamp-found image and the Greenland devil tablet, but had come in his\\ndreams upon at least three of the precise words of the formula uttered\\nalike by Eskimo diabolists and mongrel Louisianans? Professor Angell\\'s\\ninstant start on an investigation of the utmost thoroughness was\\neminently natural; though privately I suspected young Wilcox of having\\nheard of the cult in some indirect way, and of having invented a series\\nof dreams to heighten and continue the mystery at my uncle\\'s expense.\\nThe dream-narratives and cuttings collected by the professor were, of\\ncourse, strong corroboration; but the rationalism of my mind and the\\nextravagance of the whole subject led me to adopt what I thought the\\nmost sensible conclusions. So, after thoroughly studying the manuscript\\nagain and correlating the theosophical and anthropological notes with\\nthe cult narrative of Legrasse, I made a trip to Providence to see\\nthe sculptor and give him the rebuke I thought proper for so boldly\\nimposing upon a learned and aged man.\\n\\nWilcox still lived alone in the Fleur-de-Lys Building in Thomas\\nStreet, a hideous Victorian imitation of Seventeenth Century Breton\\narchitecture which flaunts its stuccoed front amidst the lovely\\nColonial houses on the ancient hill, and under the very shadow of the\\nfinest Georgian steeple in America. I found him at work in his rooms,\\nand at once conceded from the specimens scattered about that his genius\\nis indeed profound and authentic. He will, I believe, be heard from\\nsometime as one of the great decadents; for he has crystallized in clay\\nand will one day mirror in marble those nightmares and fantasies which\\nArthur Machen evokes in prose, and Clark Ashton Smith makes visible in\\nverse and in painting.\\n\\nDark, frail, and somewhat unkempt in aspect, he turned languidly at my\\nknock and asked me my business without rising. When I told him who I\\nwas, he displayed some interest; for my uncle had excited his curiosity\\nin probing his strange dreams, yet had never explained the reason for\\nthe study. I did not enlarge his knowledge in this regard, but sought\\nwith some subtlety to draw him out.\\n\\nIn a short time I became convinced of his absolute sincerity, for he\\nspoke of the dreams in a manner none could mistake. They and their\\nsubconscious residuum had influenced his art profoundly, and he showed\\nme a morbid statue whose contours almost made me shake with the potency\\nof its black suggestion. He could not recall having seen the original\\nof this thing except in his own dream bas-relief, but the outlines had\\nformed themselves insensibly under his hands. It was, no doubt, the\\ngiant shape he had raved of in delirium. That he really knew nothing of\\nthe hidden cult, save from what my uncle\\'s relentless catechism had let\\nfall, he soon made clear; and again I strove to think of some way in\\nwhich he could possibly have received the weird impressions.\\n\\nHe talked of his dreams in a strangely poetic fashion; making me\\nsee with terrible vividness the damp Cyclopean city of slimy green\\nstoneâ\\x80\\x94whose geometry , he oddly said, was all wrong â\\x80\\x94and hear\\nwith frightened expectancy the ceaseless, half-mental calling from\\nunderground: \" Cthulhu fhtagn ,\" \" Cthulhu fhtagn .\"\\n\\nThese words had formed part of that dread ritual which told of dead\\nCthulhu\\'s dream-vigil in his stone vault at R\\'lyeh, and I felt deeply\\nmoved despite my rational beliefs. Wilcox, I was sure, had heard of\\nthe cult in some casual way, and had soon forgotten it amidst the mass\\nof his equally weird reading and imagining. Later, by virtue of its\\nsheer impressiveness, it had found subconscious expression in dreams,\\nin the bas-relief, and in the terrible statue I now beheld; so that his\\nimposture upon my uncle had been a very innocent one. The youth was of\\na type, at once slightly affected and slightly ill-mannered, which I\\ncould never like; but I was willing enough now to admit both his genius\\nand his honesty. I took leave of him amicably, and wish him all the\\nsuccess his talent promises.\\n\\nThe matter of the cult still remained to fascinate me, and at times\\nI had visions of personal fame from researches into its origin and\\nconnections. I visited New Orleans, talked with Legrasse and others\\nof that old-time raiding-party, saw the frightful image, and even\\nquestioned such of the mongrel prisoners as still survived. Old Castro,\\nunfortunately, had been dead for some years. What I now heard so\\ngraphically at first hand, though it was really no more than a detailed\\nconfirmation of what my uncle had written, excited me afresh; for I\\nfelt sure that I was on the track of a very real, very secret, and\\nvery ancient religion whose discovery would make me an anthropologist\\nof note. My attitude was still one of absolute materialism, as I wish\\nit still were , and I discounted with almost inexplicable perversity\\nthe coincidence of the dream notes and odd cuttings collected by\\nProfessor Angell.\\n\\nOne thing which I began to suspect, and which I now fear I know , is\\nthat my uncle\\'s death was far from natural. He fell on a narrow hill\\nstreet leading up from an ancient waterfront swarming with foreign\\nmongrels, after a careless push from a negro sailor. I did not forget\\nthe mixed blood and marine pursuits of the cult-members in Louisiana,\\nand would not be surprized to learn of secret methods and poison\\nneedles as ruthless and as anciently known as the cryptic rites and\\nbeliefs. Legrasse and his men, it is true, have been let alone; but in\\nNorway a certain seaman who saw things is dead. Might not the deeper\\ninquiries of my uncle after encountering the sculptor\\'s data have come\\nto sinister ears? I think Professor Angell died because he knew too\\nmuch, or because he was likely to learn too much. Whether I shall go as\\nhe did remains to be seen, for I have learned much now.\\n\\n3. The Madness from the Sea.\\n\\nIf heaven ever wishes to grant me a boon, it will be a total effacing\\nof the results of a mere chance which fixed my eye on a certain stray\\npiece of shelf-paper. It was nothing on which I would naturally have\\nstumbled in the course of my daily round, for it was an old number of\\nan Australian journal, Sydney Bulletin for April 18, 1925. It had\\nescaped even the cutting bureau which had at the time of its issuance\\nbeen avidly collecting material for my uncle\\'s research.\\n\\nI had largely given over my inquiries into what Professor Angell called\\nthe \"Cthulhu Cult,\" and was visiting a learned friend of Paterson,\\nNew Jersey, the curator of a local museum and a mineralogist of note.\\nExamining one day the reserve specimens roughly set on the storage\\nshelves in a rear room of the museum, my eye was caught by an odd\\npicture in one of the old papers spread beneath the stones. It was the Sydney Bulletin I have mentioned, for my friend has wide affiliations\\nin all conceivable foreign parts; and the picture was a half-tone cut\\nof a hideous stone image almost identical with that which Legrasse had\\nfound in the swamp.\\n\\nEagerly clearing the sheet of its precious contents, I scanned the item\\nin detail; and was disappointed to find it of only moderate length.\\nWhat it suggested, however, was of portentous significance to my\\nflagging quest; and I carefully tore it out for immediate action. It\\nread as follows:\\n\\nMYSTERY DERELICT FOUND AT SEA\\n\\nVigilant Arrives With Helpless Armed New Zealand Yacht in Tow.\\nOne Survivor and Dead Man Found Aboard. Tale of Desperate Battle\\nand Deaths at Sea. Rescued Seaman Refuses Particulars of Strange\\nExperience. Odd Idol Found in His Possession. Inquiry to Follow.\\n\\nThe Morrison Co.\\'s freighter Vigilant , bound from Valparaiso,\\narrived this morning at its wharf in Darling Harbour, having in tow\\nthe battled and disabled but heavily armed steam yacht Alert of\\nDunedin, N. Z., which was sighted April 12th in S. Latitude 34Â° 21\\',\\nW. Longitude 152Â° 17\\', with one living and one dead man aboard.\\n\\nThe Vigilant left Valparaiso March 25th, and on April 2d was driven\\nconsiderably south of her course by exceptionally heavy storms and\\nmonster waves. On April 12th the derelict was sighted; and though\\napparently deserted, was found upon boarding to contain one survivor\\nin a half-delirious condition and one man who had evidently been dead\\nfor more than a week.\\n\\nThe living man was clutching a horrible stone idol of unknown origin,\\nabout a foot in height, regarding whose nature authorities at Sydney\\nUniversity, the Royal Society, and the Museum in College Street all\\nprofess complete bafflement, and which the survivor says he found in\\nthe cabin of the yacht, in a small carved shrine of common pattern.\\n\\nThis man, after recovering his senses, told an exceedingly strange\\nstory of piracy and slaughter. He is Gustaf Johansen, a Norwegian of\\nsome intelligence, and had been second mate of the two-masted schooner Emma of Auckland, which sailed for Callao February 20th, with a\\ncomplement of eleven men.\\n\\nThe Emma , he says, was delayed and thrown widely south of her course\\nby the great storm of March 1st, and on March 22d, in S. Latitude\\n49Â° 51Â´, W. Longitude 128Â° 34Â´, encountered the Alert , manned by\\na queer and evil-looking crew of Kanakas and half-castes. Being\\nordered peremptorily to turn back, Capt. Collins refused; whereupon\\nthe strange crew began to fire savagely and without warning upon the\\nschooner with a peculiarly heavy battery of brass cannon forming part\\nof the yacht\\'s equipment.\\n\\nThe Emma\\'s men showed fight, says the survivor, and though the\\nschooner began to sink from shots beneath the waterline they managed\\nto heave alongside their enemy and board her, grappling with the\\nsavage crew on the yacht\\'s deck, and being forced to kill them all,\\nthe number being slightly superior, because of their particularly\\nabhorrent and desperate though rather clumsy mode of fighting.\\n\\nThree of the Emma\\'s men, including Capt. Collins and First Mate\\nGreen, were killed; and the remaining eight under Second Mate Johansen\\nproceeded to navigate the captured yacht, going ahead in their\\noriginal direction to see if any reason for their ordering back had\\nexisted.\\n\\nThe next day, it appears, they raised and landed on a small island,\\nalthough none is known to exist in that part of the ocean; and six of\\nthe men somehow died ashore, though Johansen is queerly reticent about\\nthis part of his story and speaks only of their falling into a rock\\nchasm.\\n\\nLater, it seems, he and one companion boarded the yacht and tried to\\nmanage her, but were beaten about by the storm of April 2nd.\\n\\nFrom that time till his rescue on the 12th, the man remembers little,\\nand he does not even recall when William Briden, his companion, died.\\nBriden\\'s death reveals no apparent cause, and was probably due to\\nexcitement or exposure.\\n\\nCable advices from Dunedin report that the Alert was well known\\nthere as an island trader, and bore an evil reputation along the\\nwaterfront. It was owned by a curious group of half-castes whose\\nfrequent meetings and night trips to the woods attracted no little\\ncuriosity; and it had set sail in great haste just after the storm and\\nearth tremors of March 1st.\\n\\nOur Auckland correspondent gives the Emma and her crew an excellent\\nreputation, and Johansen is described as a sober and worthy man.\\n\\nThe admiralty will institute an inquiry on the whole matter beginning\\ntomorrow, at which every effort will be made to induce Johansen to\\nspeak more freely than he has done hitherto.\\n\\nThis was all, together with the picture of the hellish image; but what\\na train of ideas it started in my mind! Here were new treasuries of\\ndata on the Cthulhu Cult, and evidence that it had strange interests\\nat sea as well as on land. What motive prompted the hybrid crew to\\norder back the Emma as they sailed about with their hideous idol?\\nWhat was the unknown island on which six of the Emma\\'s crew had\\ndied, and about which the mate Johansen was so secretive? What had the\\nvice-admiralty\\'s investigation brought out, and what was known of the\\nnoxious cult in Dunedin? And most marvelous of all, what deep and more\\nthan natural linkage of dates was this which gave a malign and now\\nundeniable significance to the various turns of events so carefully\\nnoted by my uncle?\\n\\nMarch 1stâ\\x80\\x94our February 28th according to the International Date\\nLineâ\\x80\\x94the earthquake and storm had come. From Dunedin the Alert and\\nher noisome crew had darted eagerly forth as if imperiously summoned,\\nand on the other side of the earth poets and artists had begun to\\ndream of a strange, dank Cyclopean city whilst a young sculptor had\\nmolded in his sleep the form of the dreaded Cthulhu. March 23rd the\\ncrew of the Emma landed on an unknown island and left six men dead;\\nand on that date the dreams of sensitive men assumed a heightened\\nvividness and darkened with dread of a giant monster\\'s malign pursuit,\\nwhilst an architect had gone mad and a sculptor had lapsed suddenly\\ninto delirium! And what of this storm of April 2ndâ\\x80\\x94the date on which\\nall dreams of the dank city ceased, and Wilcox emerged unharmed from\\nthe bondage of strange fever? What of all thisâ\\x80\\x94and of those hints of\\nold Castro about the sunken, star-born Old Ones and their coming reign;\\ntheir faithful cult and their mastery of dreams ? Was I tottering on\\nthe brink of cosmic horrors beyond man\\'s power to bear? If so, they\\nmust be horrors of the mind alone, for in some way the second of April\\nhad put a stop to whatever monstrous menace had begun its siege of\\nmankind\\'s soul.\\n\\nThat evening, after a day of hurried cabling and arranging, I bade my\\nhost adieu and took a train for San Francisco. In less than a month\\nI was in Dunedin; where, however, I found that little was known of\\nthe strange cult-members who had lingered in the old sea taverns.\\nWaterfront scum was far too common for special mention; though there\\nwas vague talk about one inland trip these mongrels had made, during\\nwhich faint drumming and red flame were noted on the distant hills.\\n\\nIn Auckland I learned that Johansen had returned with yellow hair\\nturned white after a perfunctory and inconclusive questioning at\\nSydney, and had thereafter sold his cottage in West Street and sailed\\nwith his wife to his old home in Oslo. Of his stirring experience\\nhe would tell his friends no more than he had told the admiralty\\nofficials, and all they could do was to give me his Oslo address.\\n\\nAfter that I went to Sydney and talked profitlessly with seamen and\\nmembers of the vice-admiralty court. I saw the Alert , now sold and\\nin commercial use, at Circular Quay in Sydney Cove, but gained nothing\\nfrom its non-committal bulk. The crouching image with its cuttlefish\\nhead, dragon body, scaly wings, and hieroglyphed pedestal, was\\npreserved in the Museum at Hyde Park; and I studied it long and well,\\nfinding it a thing of balefully exquisite workmanship, and with the\\nsame utter mystery, terrible antiquity, and unearthly strangeness of\\nmaterial which I had noted in Legrasse\\'s smaller specimen. Geologists,\\nthe curator told me, had found it a monstrous puzzle; for they vowed\\nthat the world held no rock like it. Then I thought with a shudder of\\nwhat old Castro had told Legrasse about the primal Great Ones: \"They\\nhad come from the stars, and had brought Their images with Them.\"\\n\\nShaken with such a mental revolution as I had never before known, I\\nnow resolved to visit Mate Johansen in Oslo. Sailing for London, I\\nre-embarked at once for the Norwegian capital; and one autumn day\\nlanded at the trim wharves in the shadow of the Egeberg.\\n\\nJohansen\\'s address, I discovered, lay in the Old Town of King Harold\\nHaardrada, which kept alive the name of Oslo during all the centuries\\nthat the greater city masqueraded as \"Christiania.\" I made the brief\\ntrip by taxicab, and knocked with palpitant heart at the door of a neat\\nand ancient building with plastered front. A sad-faced woman in black\\nanswered my summons, and I was stung with disappointment when she told\\nme in halting English that Gustaf Johansen was no more.\\n\\nHe had not long survived his return, said his wife, for the doings at\\nsea in 1925 had broken him. He had told her no more than he had told\\nthe public, but had left a long manuscriptâ\\x80\\x94of \"technical matters\" as\\nhe saidâ\\x80\\x94written in English, evidently in order to safeguard her from\\nthe peril of casual perusal. During a walk through a narrow lane near\\nthe Gothenburg dock, a bundle of papers falling from an attic window\\nhad knocked him down. Two Lascar sailors at once helped him to his\\nfeet, but before the ambulance could reach him he was dead. Physicians\\nfound no adequate cause for the end, and laid it to heart trouble and a\\nweakened constitution.\\n\\nI now felt gnawing at my vitals that dark terror which will never leave\\nme till I, too, am at rest; \"accidentally\" or otherwise. Persuading the\\nwidow that my connection with her husband\\'s \"technical matters\" was\\nsufficient to entitle me to his manuscript, I bore the document away\\nand began to read it on the London boat.\\n\\nIt was a simple, rambling thingâ\\x80\\x94a naive sailor\\'s effort at a\\npost-facto diaryâ\\x80\\x94and strove to recall day by day that last awful\\nvoyage. I can not attempt to transcribe it verbatim in all its\\ncloudiness and redundance, but I will tell its gist enough to show why\\nthe sound of the water against the vessel\\'s sides became so unendurable\\nto me that I stopped my ears with cotton.\\n\\nJohansen, thank God, did not know quite all, even though he saw the\\ncity and the Thing, but I shall never sleep calmly again when I think\\nof the horrors that lurk ceaselessly behind life in time and in space,\\nand of those unhallowed blasphemies from elder stars which dream\\nbeneath the sea, known and favored by a nightmare cult ready and eager\\nto loose them on the world whenever another earthquake shall heave\\ntheir monstrous stone city again to the sun and air.\\n\\nJohansen\\'s voyage had begun just as he told it to the vice-admiralty.\\nThe Emma , in ballast, had cleared Auckland on February 20th, and had\\nfelt the full force of that earthquake-born tempest which must have\\nheaved up from the sea-bottom the horrors that filled men\\'s dreams.\\nOnce more under control, the ship was making good progress when held\\nup by the Alert on March 22nd, and I could feel the mate\\'s regret as\\nhe wrote of her bombardment and sinking. Of the swarthy cult-fiends\\non the Alert he speaks with significant horror. There was some\\npeculiarly abominable quality about them which made their destruction\\nseem almost a duty, and Johansen shows ingenuous wonder at the charge\\nof ruthlessness brought against his party during the proceedings of the\\ncourt of inquiry. Then, driven ahead by curiosity in their captured\\nyacht under Johansen\\'s command, the men sight a great stone pillar\\nsticking out of the sea, and in S. Latitude 47Â° 9\\', W. Longitude 126Â°\\n43\\' come upon a coastline of mingled mud, ooze, and weedy Cyclopean\\nmasonry which can be nothing less than the tangible substance of\\nearth\\'s supreme terrorâ\\x80\\x94the nightmare corpse-city of R\\'lyeh, that\\nwas built in measureless eons behind history by the vast, loathsome\\nshapes that seeped down from the dark stars. There lay great Cthulhu\\nand his hordes, hidden in green slimy vaults and sending out at last,\\nafter cycles incalculable, the thoughts that spread fear to the dreams\\nof the sensitive and called imperiously to the faithful to come on a\\npilgrimage of liberation and restoration. All this Johansen did not\\nsuspect, but God knows he soon saw enough!\\n\\nI suppose that only a single mountain-top, the hideous monolith-crowned\\ncitadel whereon great Cthulhu was buried, actually emerged from the\\nwaters. When I think of the extent of all that may be brooding down\\nthere I almost wish to kill myself forthwith. Johansen and his men were\\nawed by the cosmic majesty of this dripping Babylon of elder demons,\\nand must have guessed without guidance that it was nothing of this or\\nof any sane planet. Awe at the unbelievable size of the greenish stone\\nblocks, at the dizzying height of the great carven monolith, and at the\\nstupefying identity of the colossal statues and bas-reliefs with the\\nqueer image found in the shrine on the Alert , is poignantly visible\\nin every line of the mate\\'s frightened description.\\n\\nWithout knowing what futurism is like, Johansen achieved something\\nvery close to it when he spoke of the city; for instead of describing\\nany definite structure or building, he dwells only on the broad\\nimpressions of vast angles and stone surfacesâ\\x80\\x94surfaces too great to\\nbelong to anything right or proper for this earth, and impious with\\nhorrible images and hieroglyphs. I mention his talk about angles because it suggests something Wilcox had told me of his awful dreams.\\nHe had said that the geometry of the dream-place he saw was abnormal,\\nnon-Euclidean, and loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart\\nfrom ours. Now an unlettered seaman felt the same thing whilst gazing\\nat the terrible reality.\\n\\nJohansen and his men landed at a sloping mud-bank on this monstrous\\nAcropolis, and clambered slipperily up over titan oozy blocks which\\ncould have been no mortal staircase. The very sun of heaven seemed\\ndistorted when viewed through the polarizing miasma welling out from\\nthis sea-soaked perversion, and twisted menace and suspense lurked\\nleeringly in those crazily elusive angles of carven rock where a second\\nglance showed concavity after the first showed convexity.\\n\\nSomething very like fright had come over all the explorers before\\nanything more definite than rock and ooze and weed was seen. Each\\nwould have fled had he not feared the scorn of the others, and it was\\nonly half-heartedly that they searchedâ\\x80\\x94vainly, as it provedâ\\x80\\x94for some\\nportable souvenir to bear away.\\n\\nIt was Rodriguez the Portuguese who climbed up the foot of the monolith\\nand shouted of what he had found. The rest followed him, and looked\\ncuriously at the immense carved door with the now familiar squid-dragon\\nbas-relief. It was, Johansen said, like a great barn-door; and they all\\nfelt that it was a door because of the ornate lintel, threshold, and\\njambs around it, though they could not decide whether it lay flat like\\na trap-door or slantwise like an outside cellar-door. As Wilcox would\\nhave said, the geometry of the place was all wrong. One could not be\\nsure that the sea and the ground were horizontal, hence the relative\\nposition of everything else seemed fantasmally variable.\\n\\nBriden pushed at the stone in several places without result. Then\\nDonovan felt over it delicately around the edge, pressing each point\\nseparately as he went. He climbed interminably along the grotesque\\nstone moldingâ\\x80\\x94that is, one would call it climbing if the thing was not\\nafter all horizontalâ\\x80\\x94and the men wondered how any door in the universe\\ncould be so vast. Then, very softly and slowly, the acre-great panel\\nbegan to give inward at the top; and they saw that it was balanced.\\n\\nDonovan slid or somehow propelled himself down or along the jamb and\\nrejoined his fellows, and everyone watched the queer recession of the\\nmonstrously carven portal. In this fantasy of prismatic distortion it\\nmoved anomalously in a diagonal way, so that all the rules of matter\\nand perspective seemed upset.\\n\\nThe aperture was black with a darkness almost material. That\\ntenebrousness was indeed a positive quality ; for it obscured such\\nparts of the inner walls as ought to have been revealed, and actually\\nburst forth like smoke from its eon-long imprisonment, visibly\\ndarkening the sun as it slunk away into the shrunken and gibbous sky\\non flapping membranous wings. The odor arising from the newly opened\\ndepths was intolerable, and at length the quick-eared Hawkins thought\\nhe heard a nasty, slopping sound down there. Everyone listened, and\\neveryone was listening still when It lumbered slobberingly into sight\\nand gropingly squeezed Its gelatinous green immensity through the black\\ndoorway into the tainted outside air of that poison city of madness.\\n\\nPoor Johansen\\'s handwriting almost gave out when he wrote of this. Of\\nthe six men who never reached the ship, he thinks two perished of pure\\nfright in that accursed instant. The Thing can not be describedâ\\x80\\x94there\\nis no language for such abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy,\\nsuch eldritch contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic order.\\nA mountain walked or stumbled. God! What wonder that across the earth\\na great architect went mad, and poor Wilcox raved with fever in that\\ntelepathic instant? The Thing of the idols, the green, sticky spawn of\\nthe stars, had awaked to claim his own. The stars were right again, and\\nwhat an age-old cult had failed to do by design, a band of innocent\\nsailors had done by accident. After vigintillions of years great\\nCthulhu was loose again, and ravening for delight.\\n\\nThree men were swept up by the flabby claws before anybody turned. God\\nrest them, if there be any rest in the universe. They were Donovan,\\nGuerrera and Angstrom. Parker slipped as the other three were plunging\\nfrenziedly over endless vistas of green-crusted rock to the boat,\\nand Johansen swears he was swallowed up by an angle of masonry which\\nshouldn\\'t have been there; an angle which was acute, but behaved as\\nif it were obtuse. So only Briden and Johansen reached the boat, and\\npulled desperately for the Alert as the mountainous monstrosity\\nflopped down the slimy stones and hesitated floundering at the edge of\\nthe water.\\n\\nSteam had not been suffered to go down entirely, despite the departure\\nof all hands for the shore; and it was the work of only a few moments\\nof feverish rushing up and down between wheels and engines to get\\nthe Alert under way. Slowly, amidst the distorted horrors of that\\nindescribable scene, she began to churn the lethal waters; whilst on\\nthe masonry of that charnel shore that was not of earth the titan Thing\\nfrom the stars slavered and gibbered like Polypheme cursing the fleeing\\nship of Odysseus. Then, bolder than the storied Cyclops, great Cthulhu\\nslid greasily into the water and began to pursue with vast wave-raising\\nstrokes of cosmic potency. Briden looked back and went mad, laughing\\nshrilly as he kept on laughing at intervals till death found him one\\nnight in the cabin whilst Johansen was wandering deliriously.\\n\\nBut Johansen had not given out yet. Knowing that the Thing could\\nsurely overtake the Alert until steam was fully up, he resolved\\non a desperate chance; and, setting the engine for full speed, ran\\nlightning-like on deck and reversed the wheel. There was a mighty\\neddying and foaming in the noisome brine, and as the steam mounted\\nhigher and higher the brave Norwegian drove his vessel head on against\\nthe pursuing jelly which rose above the unclean froth like the stern\\nof a demon galleon. The awful squid-head with writhing feelers came\\nnearly up to the bowsprit of the sturdy yacht, but Johansen drove on\\nrelentlessly.\\n\\nThere was a bursting as of an exploding bladder, a slushy nastiness\\nas of a cloven sunfish, a stench as of a thousand opened graves, and\\na sound that the chronicler would not put on paper. For an instant\\nthe ship was befouled by an acrid and blinding green cloud, and then\\nthere was only a venomous seething astern; whereâ\\x80\\x94God in heaven!â\\x80\\x94the\\nscattered plasticity of that nameless sky-spawn was nebulously recombining in its hateful original form, whilst its distance widened\\nevery second as the Alert gained impetus from its mounting steam.\\n\\nThat was all. After that Johansen only brooded over the idol in the\\ncabin and attended to a few matters of food for himself and the\\nlaughing maniac by his side. He did not try to navigate after the first\\nbold flight, for the reaction had taken something out of his soul. Then\\ncame the storm of April 2nd, and a gathering of the clouds about his\\nconsciousness. There is a sense of spectral whirling through liquid\\ngulfs of infinity, of dizzying rides through reeling universes on a\\ncomet\\'s tail, and of hysterical plunges from the pit to the moon and\\nfrom the moon back again to the pit, all livened by a cachinnating\\nchorus of the distorted, hilarious elder gods and the green, bat-winged\\nmocking imps of Tartarus.\\n\\nOut of that dream came rescueâ\\x80\\x94the Vigilant , the vice-admiralty\\ncourt, the streets of Dunedin, and the long voyage back home to the\\nold house by the Egeberg. He could not tellâ\\x80\\x94they would think him mad.\\nHe would write of what he knew before death came, but his wife must not\\nguess. Death would be a boon if only it could blot out the memories.\\n\\nThat was the document I read, and now I have placed it in the tin box\\nbeside the bas-relief and the papers of Professor Angell. With it shall\\ngo this record of mineâ\\x80\\x94this test of my own sanity, wherein is pieced\\ntogether that which I hope may never be pieced together again. I have\\nlooked upon all that the universe has to hold of horror, and even the\\nskies of spring and the flowers of summer must ever afterward be poison\\nto me. But I do not think my life will be long. As my uncle went, as\\npoor Johansen went, so I shall go. I know too much, and the cult still\\nlives.\\n\\nCthulhu still lives, too, I suppose, again in that chasm of stone\\nwhich has shielded him since the sun was young. His accursed city is\\nsunken once more, for the Vigilant sailed over the spot after the\\nApril storm; but his ministers on earth still bellow and prance and\\nslay around idol-capped monoliths in lonely places. He must have been\\ntrapped by the sinking whilst within his black abyss, or else the world\\nwould by now be screaming with fright and frenzy. Who knows the end?\\nWhat has risen may sink, and what has sunk may rise. Loathsomeness\\nwaits and dreams in the deep, and decay spreads over the tottering\\ncities of men. A time will comeâ\\x80\\x94but I must not and can not think! Let\\nme pray that, if I do not survive this manuscript, my executors may put\\ncaution before audacity and see that it meets no other eye.\\n\\n[1] Found among the papers of the late Francis Wayland\\nThurston, of Boston.',\n",

It is possible that man may\\nsometimes return on the track of evolution, and\\nit is my belief that an awful lore is not yet\\ndead.\"\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x94Arthur Machen\\n\\nI\\n\\nNot many weeks ago, on a street corner\\nin the village of Pascoag, Rhode\\nIsland, a tall heavily built, and\\nwholesome looking pedestrian furnished much\\nspeculation by a singular lapse of behavior.\\nHe had, it appears, been descending the hill\\nby the road from Chepachet; and encountering\\nthe compact section, had turned to\\nhis left into the main thoroughfare where\\nseveral modest business blocks convey a\\ntouch of the urban.  At this point, without\\nvisible provocation, he committed his astonishing\\nlapse; staring queerly for a second at\\nthe tallest of the buildings, before him,\\nand then, with a series of terrified, hysterical\\nshrieks, breaking into a frantic run which\\nended in a stumble and fall at the next\\ncrossing.  Picked up and dusted off by ready\\nhands, he was found to be conscious,\\norganically unhurt, and evidently cured of his\\nsudden nervous attack.  He muttered some\\nshamefaced explanations involving a strain\\nhe had undergone, and with downcast glance\\nturned back, up the Chepachet road,\\ntrudging out of sight, without once looking\\nbehind him.  It was a strange incident to\\nbefall so large, robust, normal-featured,\\nand capable-looking a man, and the strangeness\\nwas not lessened by the remarks of a\\nbystander who had recognized him as the\\nboarder of a well-known dairyman on the\\noutskirts of Chepachet.\\n\\nHe was, it developed, a New York\\npolice-detective named Thomas F. Malone, now\\non a long leave of absence under medical\\ntreatment after some disproportionately\\narduous work on a gruesome local case which\\naccident had made dramatic.  There had been\\na collapse of several old brick buildings\\nduring a raid in which he had shared, and\\nsomething about the wholesale loss of life,\\nboth of prisoners and of his companions,\\nhad peculiarly appalled him.  As a result,\\nhe had acquired an acute and anomalous\\nhorror of any buildings even remotely\\nsuggesting the ones which had fallen in, so that\\nin the end mental specialists forbade him\\nthe sight of such things for an indefinite\\nperiod.  A police surgeon with relatives in\\nChepachet had put forward that quaint\\nhamlet of wooden Colonial houses as an ideal\\nspot for the psychological convalescence; and\\nthither the sufferer had gone, promising\\nnever to venture among the brick-lined\\nstreets of larger villages till duly advised by\\nthe Woonsocket specialist with whom he\\nwas put in touch.  This walk to Pascoag for\\nmagazines had been a mistake, and the\\npatient had paid in fright, bruises, and\\nhumiliation for his disobedience.\\n\\nSo much the gossips of Chepachet and\\nPascoag knew; and so much, also, the most\\nlearned specialists believed.  But Malone had\\nat first told the specialists much more,\\nceasing only when he saw that utter incredulity\\nwas his portion.  Thereafter he held his\\npeace, protesting not at all when it was\\ngenerally agreed that the collapse of certain\\nsqualid brick houses in the Red Hook\\nsection of Brooklyn, and the consequent death\\nof many brave officers, had unseated his\\nnervous equilibrium.  He had worked too\\nhard, all said, in trying to clean up those\\nnests of disorder and violence; certain\\nfeatures were shocking enough, in all\\nconscience, and the unexpected tragedy was the\\nlast straw.  This was a simple explanation\\nwhich everyone could understand, and\\nbecause Malone was not a simple person he\\nperceived that he had better let it suffice.\\nTo hint to unimaginative people of a horror\\nbeyond all human conceptionâ\\x80\\x94a horror of\\nhouses and blocks and cities leprous and\\ncancerous with evil dragged from elder\\nworldsâ\\x80\\x94would be merely to invite a padded\\ncell instead of a restful rustication, and\\nMalone was a man of sense despite his\\nmysticism.  He had the Celt\\'s far vision of\\nweird and hidden things, but the logician\\'s\\nquick eye for the outwardly unconvincing;\\nan amalgam which had led him far afield in\\nthe forty-two years of his life, and set him\\nin strange places for a Dublin University\\nman born in a Georgian villa near Phoenix\\nPark.\\n\\nAnd now, as he reviewed the things\\nhe had seen and felt and apprehended,\\nMalone was content to keep unshared the\\nsecret of what could reduce a dauntless\\nfighter to a quivering neurotic; what could\\nmake old brick slums and seas of dark,\\nsubtle faces a thing of nightmare and\\neldritch portent.  It would not be the first\\ntime his sensations had been forced to bide\\nuninterpretedâ\\x80\\x94for was not his very act of\\nplunging into the polyglot abyss of New\\nYork\\'s underworld a freak beyond sensible\\nexplanation?  What could he tell the prosaic\\nof the antique witcheries and grotesque\\nmarvels discernible to sensitive eyes amidst\\nthe poison cauldron where all the varied\\ndregs of unwholesome ages mix their venom\\nand perpetuate their obscene terrors?  He\\nhad seen the hellish green flame of secret\\nwonder in this blatant, evasive welter of\\noutward greed and inward blasphemy, and\\nhad smiled gently when all the New Yorkers\\nhe knew scoffed at his experiment in\\npolice work.  They had been very witty and\\ncynical, deriding his fantastic pursuit of\\nunknowable mysteries and assuring him that\\nin these days New York held nothing but\\ncheapness and vulgarity.  One of them had\\nwagered him a heavy sum that he could\\nnotâ\\x80\\x94despite many poignant things to his credit\\nin the Dublin Review â\\x80\\x94even write a truly\\ninteresting story of New York low life; and\\nnow, looking back, he perceived that cosmic\\nirony had justified the prophet\\'s words while\\nsecretly confuting their flippant meaning.\\nThe horror, as glimpsed at last, could not\\nmake a storyâ\\x80\\x94for like the book cited by\\nPoe\\'s German authority, \"er lÃ¤sst sich nicht\\nlesen\"â\\x80\\x94it does not permit itself to be read.\\n\\nII\\n\\nTo Malone the sense of latent\\nmystery in existence was always present.\\nIn youth he had felt the hidden beauty and\\necstasy of things, and had been a poet; but\\npoverty and sorrow and exile had turned his\\ngaze in darker directions, and he had\\nthrilled at the imputations of evil in the\\nworld around.  Daily life had for him come\\nto be a fantasmagoria of macabre shadow-studies;\\nnow glittering and jeering with concealed\\nrottenness as in Aubrey Beardsley\\'s\\nbest manner, now hinting terrors behind the\\ncommonest shapes and objects as in the\\nsubtler and less obvious work of Gustave\\nDorÃ©.  He would often regard it as merciful\\nthat most persons of high intelligence jeer\\nat the inmost mysteries; for, he argued, if\\nsuperior minds were ever placed in fullest\\ncontact with the secrets preserved by ancient\\nand lowly cults, the resultant abnormalities\\nwould soon not only wreck the world,\\nbut threaten the very integrity of the\\nuniverse.  All this reflection was no doubt\\nmorbid, but keen logic and a deep sense of\\nhumor ably offset it.  Malone was satisfied to\\nlet his notions remain as half-spied and\\nforbidden visions to be lightly played with;\\nand hysteria came only when duty flung him\\ninto a hell of revelation too sudden and\\ninsidious to escape.\\n\\nHe had for some time been detailed to\\nthe Butler Street station in Brooklyn when\\nthe Red Hook matter came to his notice.\\nRed Hook is a maze of hybrid squalor near\\nthe ancient waterfront opposite Governor\\'s\\nIsland, with dirty highways climbing the\\nhill from the wharves to that higher ground\\nwhere the decayed lengths of Clinton and\\nCourt Streets lead off toward the Borough\\nHall.  Its houses are mostly of brick, dating\\nfrom the first quarter of the middle of the\\nnineteenth century, and some of the\\nobscurer alleys and byways have that alluring\\nantique flavor which conventional reading\\nleads us to call \"Dickensian.\"  The population\\nis a hopeless tangle and enigma; Syrian,\\nSpanish, Italian, and Negro elements\\nimpinging upon one another, and fragments of\\nScandinavian and American belts lying not\\nfar distant.  It is a babel of sound and filth,\\nand sends out strange cries to answer the\\nlapping of oily waves at its grimy piers and\\nthe monstrous organ litanies of the harbor\\nwhistles.  Here long ago a brighter picture\\ndwelt, with clear-eyed mariners on the lower\\nstreets and homes of taste and substance\\nwhere the larger houses line the hill.  One\\ncan trace the relics of this former happiness\\nin the trim shapes of the buildings, the\\noccasional graceful churches and the evidences\\nof original art and background in bits of\\ndetail here and thereâ\\x80\\x94a worn flight of steps,\\na battered doorway, a wormy pair of decorative\\ncolumns or pilasters, or a fragment of\\nonce green space with bent and rusted iron\\nrailing.  The houses are generally in solid\\nblocks, and now and then a many-windowed\\ncupola arises to tell of days when the\\nhouseholds of captains and ship-owners watched\\nthe sea.\\n\\nFrom this tangle of material and spiritual\\nputrescence the blasphemies of an hundred\\ndialects assail the sky.  Hordes of prowlers\\nreel shouting and singing along the lanes\\nand thoroughfares, occasional furtive hands\\nsuddenly extinguish lights and pull down\\ncurtains, and swarthy, sin-pitted faces\\ndisappear from windows when visitors pick their\\nway through.  Policemen despair of order\\nor reform, and seek rather to erect barriers\\nprotecting the outside world from the contagion.\\n\\nThe clang of the patrol is answered\\nby a kind of spectral silence, and such\\nprisoners as are taken are never communicative.\\nVisible offenses are as varied as the\\nlocal dialects, and run the gamut from\\nthe smuggling of rum and prohibited aliens\\nthrough diverse stages of lawlessness and\\nobscure vice to murder and mutilation in\\ntheir most abhorrent guises.  That these\\nvisible affairs are not more frequent is not\\nto the neighborhood\\'s credit, unless the\\npower of concealment be an art demanding\\ncredit.  More people enter Red Hook than\\nleave itâ\\x80\\x94or at least, than leave it by the\\nlandward sideâ\\x80\\x94and those who are not\\nloquacious are the likeliest to leave.\\n\\nMalone found in this state of things\\na faint stench of secrets more terrible\\nthan any of the sins denounced by citizens\\nand bemoaned by priest and philanthropists.\\nHe was conscious, as one who united\\nimagination with scientific knowledge, that\\nmodern people under lawless conditions\\ntend uncannily to repeat the darkest\\ninstinctive patterns of primitive half-ape\\nsavagery in their daily life and ritual\\nobservances; and he had often viewed with\\nan anthropologist\\'s shudder the chanting,\\ncursing processions of blear-eyed and\\npock-marked young men which wound their way\\nalong in the dark small hours of morning.\\nOne saw groups of these youths incessantly;\\nsometimes in leering vigils on street corners,\\nsometimes in doorways playing eerily on\\ncheap instruments of music, sometimes in\\nstupefied dozes or indecent dialogues around\\ncafeteria tables near Borough Hall, and\\nsometimes in whispering converse around\\ndingy taxicabs drawn up at the high stoops\\nof crumbling and closely shuttered old\\nhouses.  They chilled and fascinated him\\nmore than he dared confess to his associates\\non the force, for he seemed to see in them\\nsome monstrous thread of secret continuity;\\nsome fiendish, cryptical and ancient pattern\\nutterly beyond and below the sordid mass\\nof facts and habits and haunts listed with\\nsuch conscientious technical care by the\\npolice.  They must be, he felt inwardly, the\\nheirs of some shocking and primordial\\ntradition; the sharers of debased and broken\\nscraps from cults and ceremonies older than\\nmankind.  Their coherence and definiteness\\nsuggested it, and it showed in the singular\\nsuspicion of order which lurked beneath\\ntheir squalid disorder.  He had not read in\\nvain such treatises as Miss Murray\\'s Witch\\nCult in Western Europe; and knew that up\\nto recent years there had certainly survived\\namong peasants and furtive folk a frightful\\nand clandestine system of assemblies and\\norgies descended from dark religions\\nantedating the Aryan World, and appearing in\\npopular legends as Black Masses and\\nWitches\\' Sabbaths.  That these hellish\\nvestiges of old Turanian-Asiatic magic and\\nfertility-cults were even now wholly dead\\nhe could not for a moment suppose, and\\nhe frequently wondered how much older\\nand how much blacker than the very worst\\nof the muttered tales some of them might\\nreally be.\\n\\nIII\\n\\nIt was the case of Robert Suydam which\\ntook Malone to the heart of things in\\nRed Hook.  Suydam was a lettered recluse\\nof ancient Dutch family, possessed\\noriginally of barely independent means, and\\ninhabiting the spacious but ill-preserved\\nmansion which his grandfather had built\\nin Flatbush when that village was little\\nmore then a pleasant group of Colonial\\ncottages surrounding the steepled and\\nivy-clad Reformed Church with its iron-railed\\nyard of Netherlandish gravestones.  In this\\nlonely house, set back from Martense Street\\namidst a yard of venerable trees, Suydam\\nhad read and brooded for some six decades\\nexcept for a period a generation before,\\nwhen he had sailed for the Old World\\nand remained there out of sight for eight\\nyears.  He could afford no servants, and\\nwould admit but few visitors to his absolute\\nsolitude; eschewing close friendships and\\nreceiving his rare acquaintances in one of\\nthe three ground-floor rooms, which he kept\\nin orderâ\\x80\\x94a vast, high-ceiled library whose\\nwalls were solidly packed with tattered\\nbooks of ponderous, archaic, and vaguely\\nrepellent aspect.  The growth of the town\\nand its final absorption in the Brooklyn\\ndistrict had meant nothing to Suydam, and\\nhe had come to mean less and less to the\\ntown.  Elderly people still pointed him out\\non the streets, but to most of the recent\\npopulation he was merely a queer, corpulent\\nold fellow whose unkempt white hair,\\nstubbly beard, shiny black clothes and\\ngold-headed cane earned him an amused glance\\nand nothing more.  Malone did not know\\nhim by sight till duty called him to the\\ncase, but had heard of him indirectly as a\\nreally profound authority on medieval\\nsuperstition, and had once idly meant to look\\nup an out-of-print pamphlet of his on the\\nKabbalah and the Faustus legend, which a\\nfriend had quoted from memory.\\n\\nSuydam became a \"case\" when his distant\\nand only relatives sought court pronouncements\\non his sanity.  Their action seemed\\nsudden to the outside world, but was really\\nundertaken only after prolonged observation\\nand sorrowful debate.  It was based on\\ncertain odd changes in his speech and habits;\\nwild references to impending wonders, and\\nunaccountable hauntings of disreputable\\nBrooklyn neighborhoods.  He had been\\ngrowing shabbier and shabbier with the\\nyears, and now prowled about like a\\nveritable mendicant; seen occasionally by\\nhumiliated friends in subway stations, or\\nloitering on the benches around Borough Hall\\nin conversation with groups of swarthy,\\nevil-looking strangers.  When he spoke it was\\nto babble of unlimited powers almost within\\nhis grasp, and to repeat with knowing\\nleers such mystical words of names as\\n\"Sephiroth,\" \"Ashmodai\" and \"Samael.\"  The\\ncourt action revealed that he was using\\nup his income and wasting his principal\\nin the purchase of curious tomes imported\\nfrom London and Paris, and in the\\nmaintenance of a squalid basement flat in the\\nRed Hook district where he spent nearly\\nevery night, receiving odd delegations of\\nmixed rowdies and foreigners, and apparently\\nconducting some kind of ceremonial\\nservice behind the green blinds of secretive\\nwindows.  Detectives assigned to follow him\\nreported strange cries and chants and\\nprancing of feet filtering out from these\\nnocturnal rites, and shuddered at their peculiar\\necstasy and abandon despite the commonness\\nof weird orgies in that sodden section.\\nWhen, however, the matter came to a\\nhearing, Suydam managed to preserve his\\nliberty.  Before the judge his manner grew\\nurbane and reasonable, and he freely\\nadmitted the queerness of demeanor and\\nextravagant cast of language into which he\\nhad fallen through excessive devotion to\\nstudy and research.  He was, he said,\\nengaged in the investigation of certain details\\nof European tradition which required the\\nclosest contact with foreign groups and\\ntheir songs and folk dances.  The notion\\nthat any low secret society was preying\\nupon him, as hinted by his relatives, was\\nobviously absurd; and showed how sadly\\nlimited was their understanding of him and\\nhis work.  Triumphing with his calm\\nexplanations, he was suffered to depart\\nunhindered; and the paid detectives of the\\nSuydams, Corlears and Van Brunts were\\nwithdrawn in resigned disgust.\\n\\nIt was here that an alliance of Federal\\ninspectors and police, Malone with them,\\nentered the case.  The law had watched the\\nSuydam action with interest, and had in\\nmany instances been called upon to aid the\\nprivate detectives.  In this work it developed\\nthat Suydam\\'s new associates were among\\nthe blackest and most vicious criminals of\\nRed Hook\\'s devious lanes, and that at least\\na third of them were known and repeated\\noffenders in the matter of thievery, disorder,\\nand the importation of illegal immigrants.\\nIndeed, it would not have been too much\\nto say that the old scholar\\'s particular circle\\ncoincided almost perfectly with the worst of\\nthe organized cliques which smuggled ashore\\ncertain nameless and unclassified Asian\\ndregs wisely turned back by Ellis Island.  In\\nthe teeming rookeries of Parker Placeâ\\x80\\x94since\\nrenamedâ\\x80\\x94where Suydam had his\\nbasement flat, there had grown up a very\\nunusual colony of unclassified slant-eyed\\nfolk who used the Arabic alphabet but\\nwere eloquently repudiated by the great\\nmass of Syrians in and around Atlantic\\nAvenue.  They could all have been deported\\nfor lack of credentials, but legalism is\\nslow-moving, and one does not disturb Red Hook\\nunless publicity forces one to.\\n\\nThese creatures attended a tumbledown\\nstone church, used Wednesdays as a dance\\nhall, which reared its Gothic buttresses\\nnear the vilest part of the waterfront.\\nClergy throughout Brooklyn denied the\\nplace all standing and authenticity, and\\npolicemen agreed with them when they\\nlistened to the noises it emitted at night.\\nMalone used to fancy he heard terrible\\ncracked bass notes from a hidden organ\\nfar underground when the church stood\\nempty and unlighted, whilst all observers\\ndreaded the shrieking and drumming which\\naccompanied the visible services.  Suydam,\\nwhen questioned, said he thought the ritual\\nwas some remnant of Nestorian Christianity\\ntinctured with the Shamanism of Tibet.\\nMost of the people, he conjectured, were\\nof Mongoloid stock, originating somewhere\\nin or near Kurdistanâ\\x80\\x94and Malone could\\nnot help recalling that Kurdistan is the land\\nof the Yezidees, last survivors of the Persian\\ndevil-worshippers.  However this may have\\nbeen, the stir of the Suydam investigation\\nmade it certain that these unauthorized\\nnewcomers were flooding Red Hook in\\nincreasing numbers; entering through some\\nmarine conspiracy unreached by revenue\\nofficers and harbor police, overrunning\\nParker Place and rapidly spreading up the\\nhill, and welcomed with curious fraternalism\\nby the other assorted denizens of the region.\\nTheir squat figures and characteristic\\nsquinting physiognomies grotesquely combined\\nwith flashy American clothing, appeared\\nmore and more numerously among the\\nloafers and nomad gangsters of the Borough\\nHall section; till at length it was deemed\\nnecessary to compute their number, ascertain\\ntheir sources and occupations, and find if\\npossible a way to round them up and deliver\\nthem to the proper immigration authorities.\\nTo this task Malone was assigned by agreement\\nof Federal and city forces, and as he\\ncommenced his canvass of Red Hook he felt\\npoised upon the brink of nameless terrors,\\nwith the shabby, unkempt figure of Robert\\nSuydam as archfiend and adversary.\\n\\nIV\\n\\nPolice methods are varied and ingenious.\\nMalone, through unostentatious\\nrambles, carefully casual conversations,\\nwell-timed offers of hip-pocket liquor, and\\njudicious dialogues with frightened prisoners,\\nlearned many isolated facts about the\\nmovement whose aspect had become so\\nmenacing.  The newcomers were indeed Kurds,\\nbut of a dialect obscure and puzzling to\\nexact philology.  Such of them as worked\\nlived mostly as dock-hands and unlicensed\\npeddlers, though frequently serving in\\nGreek restaurants and tending corner\\nnewsstands.  Most of them, however, had no\\nvisible means of support; and were\\nobviously connected with underworld pursuits,\\nof which smuggling and bootlegging were\\nthe least indescribable.  They had come in\\nsteamships, apparently tramp freighters, and\\nhad been unloaded by stealth on moonless\\nnights in rowboats which stole under a\\ncertain wharf and followed a hidden canal\\nand house Malone could not locate, for the\\nmemories of his informants were exceedingly\\nconfused, while their speech was to a\\ngreat extent beyond even the ablest\\ninterpreters; nor could he gain any real data on\\nthe reasons for their systematic importation.\\nThey were reticent about the exact spot from\\nwhich they had come, and were never\\nsufficiently off guard to reveal the agencies\\nwhich had sought them out and directed\\ntheir course.  Indeed, they developed\\nsomething like acute fright when asked the\\nreason for their presence.  Gangsters of other\\nbreeds were equally taciturn, and the most\\nthat could be gathered was that some god\\nor great priesthood had promised them\\nunheard-of powers and supernatural glories\\nand rulerships in a strange land.\\n\\nThe attendance of both newcomers and\\nold gangsters at Suydam\\'s closely guarded\\nnocturnal meetings was very regular, and\\nthe police soon learned that the erstwhile\\nrecluse had leased additional flats to\\naccommodate such guests as knew his password;\\nat last occupying three entire houses and\\npermanently harboring many of his queer\\ncompanions.  He spent but little time now\\nat his Flatbush home, apparently going\\nand coming only to obtain and return books;\\nand his face and manner had attained an\\nappalling pitch of wildness.  Malone twice\\ninterviewed him, but was each time bruskly\\nrepulsed.  He knew nothing, he said, of any\\nmysterious plots or movements; and had no\\nidea how the Kurds could have entered or\\nwhat they wanted.  His business was to\\nstudy undisturbed the folk-lore of all the\\nimmigrants of the district; a business with\\nwhich policemen had no legitimate concern.\\nMalone mentioned his admiration for\\nSuydam\\'s old brochure on the Kabbalah and\\nother myths, but the old man\\'s softening\\nwas only momentary.  He sensed an intrusion,\\nand rebuffed his visitor in no uncertain\\nway; till Malone withdrew disgusted,\\nand turned to other channels of information.\\n\\nWhat Malone would have unearthed\\ncould he have worked continuously on\\nthe case, we shall never know.  As it was, a\\nstupid conflict between city and Federal\\nauthority suspended the investigation for\\nseveral months, during which the detective was\\nbusy with other assignments.  But at no time\\ndid he lose interest, or fail to stand amazed\\nat what began to happen to Robert Suydam.\\nJust at the time when a wave of kidnappings\\nand disappearances spread its excitement over\\nNew York, the unkempt scholar embarked\\nupon a metamorphosis as startling as it was\\nabsurd.  One day he was seen near Borough\\nHall with clean-shaved face, well-trimmed\\nhair, and tastefully immaculate attire, and\\non every day thereafter some obscure\\nimprovement was noticed in him.  He\\nmaintained his new fastidiousness without\\ninterruption, added to it an unwonted sparkle\\nof eye and crispness of speech, and began\\nlittle by little to shed the corpulence which\\nhad so long deformed him.  Now frequently\\ntaken for less than his age, he acquired an\\nelasticity of step and buoyancy of demeanor\\nto match the new tradition, and showed a\\ncurious darkening of the hair which\\nsomehow did not suggest dye.  As the months\\npassed, he commenced to dress less and less\\nconservatively, and finally astonished his\\nfew friends by renovating and redecorating\\nhis Flatbush mansion, which he threw open\\nin a series of receptions, summoning all the\\nacquaintances he could remember, and\\nextending a special welcome to the fully\\nforgiven relatives who had lately sought his\\nrestraint.  Some attended through curiosity,\\nothers through duty; but all were suddenly\\ncharmed by the dawning grace and urbanity\\nof the former hermit.  He had, he asserted,\\naccomplished most of his allotted work; and\\nhaving just inherited some property from a\\nhalf-forgotten European friend, was about\\nto spend his remaining years in a brighter\\nsecond youth which ease, care and diet had\\nmade possible to him.  Less and less was he\\nseen at Red Hook, and more and more did\\nhe move in the society to which he was born.\\nPolicemen noted a tendency of the gangsters\\nto congregate at the old stone church and\\ndancehall instead of at the basement flat in\\nParker Place, though the latter and its recent\\nannexes still overflowed with noxious life.\\n\\nThen two incidents occurredâ\\x80\\x94wide\\nenough apart, but both of intense interest\\nin the case as Malone envisaged it.  One\\nwas a quiet announcement in the Eagle of\\nRobert Suydam\\'s engagement to Miss\\nCornelia Gerritsen of Bayside, a young woman\\nof excellent position, and distantly related\\nto the elderly bridegroom-elect; whilst the\\nother was a raid on the dance-hall church\\nby city police, after a report that the face of\\na kidnapped child had been seen for a\\nsecond at one of the basement windows.\\nMalone had participated in this raid, and\\nstudied the place with much care when\\ninside.  Nothing was foundâ\\x80\\x94in fact, the\\nbuilding was entirely deserted when visitedâ\\x80\\x94but\\nthe sensitive Celt was vaguely disturbed by\\nmany things about the interior.  There were\\ncrudely painted panels he did not likeâ\\x80\\x94panels\\nwhich depicted sacred faces with\\npeculiarly worldly and sardonic expressions,\\nand which occasionally took liberties that\\neven a layman\\'s sense of decorum could\\nscarcely countenance.  Then, too, he did not\\nrelish the Greek inscription on the wall\\nabove the pulpit; an ancient incantation\\nwhich he had once stumbled upon in Dublin\\ncollege days, and which read, literally\\ntranslated: \"O friend and companion of night,\\nthou who rejoicest in the baying of dogs and\\nspilt blood, who wanderest in the midst of\\nshades among the tombs; who longest for\\nblood and bringest terror to mortals, Gorge,\\nMormo, thousand-faced moon, look favorably\\non our sacrifices!\"\\n\\nWhen he read this he shuddered, and\\nthought vaguely of the cracked bass\\norgan-notes he fancied he had heard beneath the\\nchurch on certain nights.  He shuddered\\nagain at the rust around the rim of a metal\\nbasin which stood on the altar, and paused\\nnervously when his nostrils seemed to detect\\na curious and ghastly stench from somewhere\\nin the neighborhood.  That organ memory\\nhaunted him, and he explored the basement\\nwith particular assiduity before he left.  The\\nplace was very hateful to him; yet after all,\\nwere the blasphemous panels and inscriptions\\nmore than mere crudities perpetrated\\nby the ignorant?\\n\\nBy the time of Suydam\\'s wedding the\\nkidnapping epidemic had become a\\npopular newspaper scandal.  Most of the\\nvictims were young children of the lowest\\nclasses, but the increasing number of\\ndisappearances had worked up a sentiment of the\\nstrongest fury.  Journals clamored for action\\nfrom the police, and once more the Butler\\nStreet station sent its men over Red Hook\\nfor clues, discoveries, and criminals.  Malone\\nwas glad to be on the trail again, and took\\npride in a raid on one of Suydam\\'s Parker\\nPlace houses.  There, indeed, no stolen child\\nwas found, despite the tales of screams and\\nthe red sash picked up in the areaway; but\\nthe paintings and rough inscriptions on the\\npeeling walls of most of the rooms, and the\\nprimitive chemical laboratory in the attic,\\nall helped to convince the detective that he\\nwas on the track of something tremendous.\\nThe paintings were appallingâ\\x80\\x94hideous\\nmonsters of every shape and size, and parodies\\non human outlines which cannot be\\ndescribed.  The writing was in red, and varied\\nfrom Arabic to Greek, Roman, and Hebrew\\nletters.  Malone could not read much of it,\\nbut what he did decipher was portentous\\nand cabalistic enough.  One frequently\\nrepeated motto was in a sort of Hebraized\\nHellenistic Greek, and suggested the most\\nterrible demon-evocations of the\\nAlexandrian decadence:\\n\\nHEL.  HELOYM.  SOTHER.  EMMANVEL.\\nSABOATH.  AGLA.  TETRAGRAMMATION.\\nAGYROS.  OTHEOS.  ISCHYROS.\\nATHANATOS.  IEHOVA.  VA.\\nADONAL.  SADY.  HOMOVSION.\\nMESSIAS.  ESCHEREHEYE.\\n\\nCircles and pentagrams loomed on every\\nhand, and told indubitably of the strange\\nbeliefs and aspirations of those who dwelt\\nso squalidly here.  In the cellar, however, the\\nstrangest thing was foundâ\\x80\\x94a pile of\\ngenuine gold ingots covered carelessly with a\\npiece of burlap, and bearing upon their\\nshining surfaces the same weird hieroglyphics\\nwhich also adorned the walls.  During this\\nraid the police encountered only a passive\\nresistance from the squinting Orientals that\\nswarmed from every door.  Finding nothing\\nrelevant, they had to leave all as it was; but\\nthe precinct captain wrote Suydam a note,\\nadvising him to look closely to the character\\nof his tenants, and protegÃ©s in view of the\\ngrowing public clamor.\\n\\nV\\n\\nThen came the June wedding and the\\ngreat sensation; Flatbush was gay for the\\nhour about high noon, and pennanted\\nmotors thronged the street near the old\\nDutch church where an awning stretched\\nfrom door to highway.  No local event ever\\nsurpassed the Suydam-Gerritsen nuptials in\\ntone and scale, and the party which escorted\\nthe bride and groom to the Cunard pier\\nwas, if not exactly the smartest, at least a\\nsolid page from the Social Register!  At 5\\no\\'clock adieux was waved, and the ponderous\\nliner edged away from the long pier,\\nslowly turned its nose seaward, discarded\\nits tug, and headed for widening water\\nspaces that led to Old World wonders.  By\\nnight the outer harbor was cleared, and late\\npassengers watched the stars twinkling\\nabove an unpolluted ocean.\\n\\nWhether the tramp steamer or the scream\\nwas first to gain attention, no one can say.\\nProbably they were simultaneous, but it is\\nof no use to calculate.  The scream came\\nfrom the Suydam stateroom, and the sailor\\nwho broke down the door could perhaps\\nhave told frightful things if he had not\\nforthwith gone completely madâ\\x80\\x94as it is, he\\nshrieked more loudly than the first victims,\\nand thereafter ran simpering about the\\nvessel till caught and put in irons.  The ship\\'s\\ndoctor who entered the stateroom and\\nturned on the lights a moment later did not\\ngo mad, but told nobody what he saw till\\nafterward, when he corresponded with\\nMalone in Chepachet.  It was murderâ\\x80\\x94strangulationâ\\x80\\x94but\\none need not say that the claw-mark\\non Mrs. Suydam\\'s throat could not\\nhave come from her husband\\'s or any other\\nhuman hand, or that upon the white wall\\nthere flickered for an instant in hateful red\\na legend which, later copied from memory,\\nseems to have been nothing less than the\\nfearsome Chaldee letters of the word\\n\"LILITH.\"  One need not mention these\\nthings because they vanished so quicklyâ\\x80\\x94as\\nfor Suydam, one could at least bar others\\nfrom the room until one knew what to think\\noneself.  The doctor has distinctly assured\\nMalone that he did not see IT.  The open\\nporthole, just before he turned on the lights,\\nwas clouded for a second with a certain\\nphosphorescence, and for a moment there\\nseemed to echo in the night outside the\\nsuggestion of a faint and hellish tittering; but\\nno real outline met the eye.  As proof, the\\ndoctor points to his continued sanity.\\n\\nThen the tramp steamer claimed all attention.\\nA boat put off, and a horde of swart,\\ninsolent ruffians in officers\\' dress swarmed\\naboard the temporarily halted Cunarder.\\nThey wanted Suydam or his bodyâ\\x80\\x94they had\\nknown of his trip, and for certain reasons\\nwere sure he would die.  The captain\\'s deck\\nwas almost a pandemonium; for at the\\ninstant, between the doctor\\'s report from the\\nstateroom and the demands of the men from\\nthe tramp, not even the wisest and gravest\\nseaman could think what to do.  Suddenly\\nthe leader of the visiting mariners, an Arab\\nwith a hatefully negroid mouth, pulled forth\\na dirty, crumpled paper and handed it to the\\ncaptain.  It was signed by Robert Suydam,\\nand bore the following odd message:\\n\\nIn case of sudden or unexpected accident\\nor death on my part, please deliver me or\\nmy body unquestioningly into the hands of\\nthe bearer and his associates.  Everything, for\\nme, and perhaps for you, depends on absolute\\ncompliance.  Explanations can come\\nlaterâ\\x80\\x94do not fail me now.\\n\\nRobert Suydam.\\n\\nCaptain and doctor looked at each\\nother, and the latter whispered something\\nto the former.  Finally they nodded\\nrather helplessly and led the way to the\\nSuydam stateroom.  The doctor directed the\\ncaptain\\'s glance away as he unlocked the\\ndoor and admitted the strange seamen, nor\\ndid he breathe easily, till they filed out with\\ntheir burden after an unaccountably long\\nperiod of preparation.  It was wrapped in\\nbedding from the berths, and the doctor was\\nglad that the outlines were not very\\nrevealing.  Somehow the men got the thing over\\nthe side and away to their tramp steamer\\nwithout uncovering it.\\n\\nThe Cunarder started again, and the\\ndoctor and ship\\'s undertaker sought out the\\nSuydam stateroom to perform what last\\nservices they could.  Once more the physician\\nwas forced to reticence and even to mendacity,\\nfor a hellish thing had happened.\\nWhen the undertaker asked him why he had\\ndrained off all of Mrs. Suydam\\'s blood, he\\nneglected to affirm that he had not done so;\\nnor did he point to the vacant bottle-spaces\\non the rack, or to the odor in the sink which\\nshowed the hasty disposition of the bottles\\'\\noriginal contents.  The pockets of those\\nmenâ\\x80\\x94if men they wereâ\\x80\\x94had bulged damnably\\nwhen they left the ship.  Two hours later,\\nand the world knew by radio all that it\\nought to know of the horrible affair.\\n\\nVI\\n\\nThat same June evening, without having\\nheard a word from the sea, Malone was\\nvery busy among the alleys of Red Hook.\\nA sudden stir seemed to permeate the place,\\nand as if apprized by \"grapevine telegraph\"\\nof something singular, the denizens\\nclustered expectantly around the dance-hall\\nchurch and the houses in Parker Place.\\nThree children had just disappearedâ\\x80\\x94blue-eyed\\nNorwegians from the streets toward\\nGowanusâ\\x80\\x94and there were rumors of a mob\\nforming among the sturdy Viking of that\\nsection.  Malone had for weeks been urging\\nhis colleagues to attempt a general clean-up;\\nand at last, moved by conditions more obvious\\nto their common sense than the conjectures\\nof a Dublin dreamer, they had agreed\\nupon a final stroke.  The unrest and menace\\nof this evening had been the deciding\\nfactor, and just about midnight a raiding party\\nrecruited from three stations descended\\nupon Parker Place and its environs.  Doors\\nwere battered in, stragglers arrested, and\\ncandle-lighted rooms forced to disgorge\\nunbelievable throngs of mixed foreigners in\\nfigured robes, miters and other inexplicable\\ndevices.  Much was lost in the mÃªlÃ©e for\\nobjects were thrown hastily down unexpected\\nshafts, and betraying odors deadened by the\\nsudden kindling of pungent incense.  But\\nspattered blood was everywhere, and\\nMalone shuddered whenever he saw a brazier\\nor altar from which the smoke was still\\nrising.\\n\\nHe wanted to be in several places at once,\\nand decided on Suydam\\'s basement flat only\\nafter a messenger had reported the complete\\nemptiness of the dilapidated dance-hall\\nchurch.  The flat, he thought, must hold\\nsome clue to a cult of which the occult\\nscholar had so obviously become the center\\nand leader; and it was with real expectancy\\nthat he ransacked the musty rooms, noted\\ntheir vaguely charnal odor, and examined\\nthe curious books, instruments, gold ingots,\\nand glass-stoppered bottles scattered\\ncarelessly here and there.  Once a lean,\\nblack-and-white cat edged between his feet and\\ntripped him, overturning at the same time a\\nbeaker half full of red liquid.  The shock\\nwas severe, and to this day Malone is not\\ncertain of what he saw; but in dreams he\\nstill pictures that cat as it scuttled away with\\ncertain monstrous alterations and peculiarities.\\n\\nThen came the locked cellar door, and\\nthe search for something to break it\\ndown.  A heavy stool stood near, and its\\ntough seat was more than enough for the\\nantique panels.  A crack formed and\\nenlarged, and the whole door gave wayâ\\x80\\x94but\\nfrom the other side; whence poured a howling\\ntumult of ice-cold wind with all the stenches\\nof the bottomless pit, and whence\\nreached a sucking force not of earth or\\nheaven, which, coiling sentiently about the\\nparalyzed detective, dragged him through\\nthe aperture and down unmeasured spaces\\nfilled with whispers and wails, and gusts of\\nmocking laughter.\\n\\nOf course it was a dream.  All the specialists\\nhave told him so, and he has nothing\\ntangible to prove the contrary.  Indeed, he\\nwould rather have it thus; for then the sight\\nof old brick slums and dark foreign faces\\nwould not eat so deeply into his soul.  But at\\nthe time it was all horribly real, and nothing\\ncan ever efface the memory of those nighted\\ncrypts, those titan arcades, and those\\nhalf-formed shapes of hell that strode\\ngigantically in silence holding half-eaten things\\nwhose still surviving portions screamed for\\nmercy or laughed with madness.  Odors of\\nincense and corruption joined in sickening\\nconcert, and the black air was alive with the\\ncloudy, semi-visible bulk of shapeless\\nelemental things with eyes.  Somewhere dark\\nsticky water was lapping at onyx piers, and\\nonce the shivery tinkle of raucous little bells\\npealed out to greet the insane titter of a\\nnaked phosphorescent thing which swam\\ninto sight, scrambled ashore, and climbed\\nup to squat leeringly on a carved golden\\npedestal in the black ground.\\n\\nAvenues of limitless night seemed to radiate\\nin every direction, till one might fancy\\nthat here lay the root of a contagion destined\\nto sicken and swallow cities, and engulf\\nnations in the fetor of hybrid pestilence.\\nHere cosmic sin had entered, and festered\\nby unhallowed rites had commenced the\\ngrinning march of death that was to rot us\\nall to fungus abnormalities too hideous for\\nthe grave\\'s holding.  Satan here held his\\nBabylonish court, and in the blood of\\nstainless childhood the leprous limbs of\\nphosphorescent Lilith were laved.  Incubi and\\nsuccubae howled praise to Hecate, and\\nheadless mooncalves bleated to the Magna\\nMater.  Goats leaped to the sound of thin\\naccursed flutes, and AEgipans chased\\nendlessly after misshapen fauns over rocks\\ntwisted like swollen toads.  Moloch and\\nAshtaroth were not absent; for in this\\nquintessence of all damnation the bounds of\\nconsciousness were let down, and man\\'s fancy\\nlay open to vistas of every realm of horror\\nand every forbidden dimension that evil had\\npower to mold.  The world and nature were\\nhelpless against such assaults from unsealed\\nwells of night, nor could any sign or prayer\\ncheck the Walpurgissage of horror which\\nhad come when a sage with the hateful\\nlocked and brimming coffer of transmitted\\ndemon-lore.\\n\\nSuddenly a ray of physical light shot\\nthrough these fantasms, and Malone heard\\nthe sound of oars amidst the blasphemies of\\nthings that should be dead.  A boat with a\\nlantern in its prow darted into sight, made\\nfast to an iron ring in the slimy stone pier,\\nand vomited forth several dark men bearing\\na long burden swathed in bedding.  They\\ntook it to the naked phosphorescent thing\\non the carved gold pedestal, and the thing\\ntittered and pawed the bedding.  Then they\\nunswathed it, and propped upright before\\nthe pedestal the gangrenous corpse of a\\ncorpulent old man with stubby beard and\\nunkempt white hair.  The phosphorescent\\nthing tittered again, and the men produced\\nbottles from their pockets and anointed its\\nfeet with red, whilst they afterward gave\\nthe bottles to the thing to drink from.\\n\\nAll at once, from an arcaded avenue leading\\nendlessly away, there came the demoniac\\nrattle and wheeze of a blasphemous organ,\\nchoking and rumbling out of the mockeries\\nof hell in cracked, sardonic bass.  In an\\ninstant every moving entity was electrified;\\nand forming at once into a ceremonial\\nprocession, the nightmare horde slithered away\\nin quiet of the soundâ\\x80\\x94goat, satyr, and\\nAEgipan, incubus, succuba, and lemur,\\ntwisted toad and shapeless elemental,\\ndog-faced howler and silent strutter in\\ndarknessâ\\x80\\x94all led by the abominable naked\\nphosphorescent thing that had squatted on\\nthe carved golden throne; and that now\\nstrode insolently bearing in its arms the\\nglassy-eyed corpse of the corpulent old\\nman.  The strange dark man danced in the\\nrear, and the whole column skipped and\\nleaped with Dionysiac fury.  Malone\\nstaggered after them a few steps, delirious\\nand hazy, and doubtful of his place in\\nthis or any world.  Then he turned, faltered,\\nand sank down on the cold damp stone,\\ngasping and shivering as the demon organ\\ncroaked on, and the howling and drumming\\nand tinkling of the mad procession grew\\nfainter and fainter.\\n\\nVaguely he was conscious of chanted\\nhorrors, and shocking croakings afar off.\\nNow and then a wail or whine of ceremonial\\ndevotion would float to him through\\nthe black arcade, whilst eventually there\\nrose the dreadful Greek incantation whose\\ntext he had read above the pulpit of that\\ndance-hall church.\\n\\n\"O friend and companion of night thou\\nwho rejoicest in the baying of dogs (here\\na hideous howl burst forth) and spilt\\nblood (here nameless sounds vied with\\nmorbid shriekings), who wanderest in the\\nmidst of shades among the tombs (here\\na whistling sigh occurred), who longest\\nfor blood and bringest terror to mortals\\n(short, sharp cries from myriad throats),\\nGorgo (repeated as response), Mormo\\n(repeated with ecstasy), thousand-faced\\nmoon (sighs and flute notes), look\\nfavorably on our sacrifices!\"\\n\\nAs the chant closed, a general shout\\nwent up, and hissing sounds nearly drowned\\nthe croaking of the cracked bass organ.\\nThen a gasp as from many throats, and\\na babel of barked and bleated wordsâ\\x80\\x94\"Lilith,\\nGreat Lilith, behold the Bridegroom!\"  More\\ncries, a clamor of rioting,\\nand the sharp, clicking footfalls of a\\nrunning figure.  The footfalls approached, and\\nMalone raised himself to his elbow to look.\\n\\nThe luminosity of the crypt, lately\\ndiminished, had now slightly increased;\\nand in that devil-light there appeared the\\nfleeing form of that which should not\\nflee or feel or breatheâ\\x80\\x94the glassy-eyed,\\ngangrenous corpse of the corpulent old\\nman, now needing no support, but animated\\nby some infernal sorcery of the rite just\\nclosed.  After it raced the naked, tittering,\\nphosphorescent thing that belonged on the\\ncarven pedestal, and still farther behind\\npanted the dark men, and all the dread crew\\nof sentient loathsomenesses.  The corpse\\nwas gaining on its pursuers, and seemed\\nbent on a definite object, straining with\\nevery rotting muscle toward the carved\\ngolden pedestal, whose necromantic\\nimportance was evidently so great.  Another\\nmoment and it had reached its goal, whilst\\nthe trailing throng labored on with more\\nfrantic speed.  But they were too late, for\\nin one final spurt of strength which ripped\\ntendon from tendon and sent its noisome\\nbulk floundering to the floor in a state of\\njellyish dissolution, the staring corpse which\\nhad been Robert Suydam achieved its\\nobject and its triumph.  The push had been\\ntremendous, but the force had held out;\\nand as the pusher collapsed to a muddy\\nblotch of corruption the pedestal he had\\npushed tottered, tipped, and finally careened\\nfrom its onyx base into the thick waters\\nbelow, sending up a parting gleam of carven\\ngold as it sank heavily to undreamable\\ngulfs of lower Tartarus.  In that instant,\\ntoo, the whole scene of horror faded to\\nnothingness before Malone\\'s eyes; and he\\nfainted amidst a thunderous crash which\\nseemed to blot out all the evil universe.\\n\\nVII\\n\\nMalone\\'s dream, experienced in full\\nbefore he knew of Suydam\\'s death and\\ntransfer at sea, was curiously supplemented\\nby some oddities of the case; though that\\nis no reason why anyone should believe it.\\nThe three old houses in Parker Place,\\ndoubtless long rotten with decay in its most\\ninsidious form, collapsed without visible\\ncause while half the raiders and most of\\nthe prisoners were inside; and both of the\\ngreater number were instantly killed.  Only\\nin the basements and cellars was there\\nmuch saving of life, and Malone was lucky\\nto have been deep below the house of\\nRobert Suydam.  For he really was there,\\nas no one is disposed to deny.  They found\\nhim unconscious by the edge of the\\nnight-black pool, with a grotesquely horrible\\njumble of decay and bone, identifiable\\nthrough dental work as the body of Suydam,\\na few feet away.  The case was plain, for\\nit was hither that the smugglers\\'\\nunderground canal led; and the men who took\\nSuydam from the ship had brought him\\nhome.  They themselves were never found,\\nor identified; and the ship\\'s doctor is not yet\\nsatisfied with the certitudes of the police.\\n\\nSuydam was evidently a leader in\\nextensive man-smuggling operations, for the\\ncanal to his house was but one of several\\nsubterranean channels and tunnels in the\\nneighborhood.  There was a tunnel from\\nthis house to a crypt beneath the\\ndance-hall church; a crypt accessible from the\\nchurch only through a narrow secret passage\\nin the north wall, and in whose chambers\\nsome singular and terrible things were\\ndiscovered.  The croaking organ was there,\\nas well as a vast arched chapel with wooden\\nbenches and a strangely figured altar.  The\\nwalls were lined with small cells, in\\nseventeen of whichâ\\x80\\x94hideous to relateâ\\x80\\x94solitary\\nprisoners in a state of complete idiocy\\nwere found chained, including four mothers\\nwith infants of disturbingly strange\\nappearance.  These infants died soon after\\nexposure to the light; a circumstance which\\nthe doctors thought rather merciful.  Nobody\\nbut Malone, among those who inspected\\nthem, remembered the somber question of\\nold Delrio: \"An sint unquan daemones\\nincubi et succubae, et an ex tali, congressu\\nproles nasci queat?\"\\n\\nBefore the canals were filled up they\\nwere thoroughly dredged, and yielded\\nforth a sensational array of sawed and split\\nbones of all sizes.  The kidnapping epidemic,\\nvery clearly, had been traced home; though\\nonly two of the surviving prisoners could\\nby any legal thread be connected with it.\\nThese men are now in prison, since they\\nfailed of conviction as accessories in the\\nactual murders.  The carved golden pedestal\\nor throne so often mentioned by Malone\\nas of primary occult importance was never\\nbrought to light, though at one place under\\nthe Suydam house the canal, was observed\\nto sink into a well too deep for dredging.\\nIt was choked up at the mouth and cemented\\nover when the cellars of the new houses\\nwere made, but Malone often speculates\\non what lied beneath.  The police, satisfied\\nthat they had shattered a dangerous gang\\nof maniacs and alien smugglers, turned over\\nto the Federal authorities the unconvicted\\nKurds, who before their deportation were\\nconclusively found to belong to the Yezidee\\nclan of devils-worshippers.  The tramp ship\\nand its crew remain an elusive mystery,\\nthough cynical detectives are once more\\nready to combat its smuggling and\\nrum-running ventures.  Malone thinks these\\ndetectives show a sadly limited perspective\\nin their lack of wonder at the myriad\\nunexplainable details, and the suggestive\\nobscurity of the whole case; though he is\\njust as critical of the newspapers, which\\nsaw only a morbid sensation and gloated\\nover a minor sadist cult when they might\\nhave proclaimed a horror from the\\nuniverse\\'s very heart.  But he is content to rest\\nsilent in Chepachet, calming his nervous\\nsystem and praying that time may gradually\\ntransfer his terrible experience from the\\nrealm of present reality to that of\\npicturesque and semi-mythical remoteness.\\n\\nRobert Suydam sleeps beside his bride\\nin Greenwood Cemetery.  No funeral was\\nheld over the strangely released bones,\\nand relatives are grateful for the swift\\noblivion which overtook the case as a\\nwhole.\\n\\nThe scholar\\'s connection with the Red\\nHook horrors, indeed, was never emblazoned\\nby legal proof; since his death forestalled the\\ninquiry he would otherwise have faced.\\nHis own end is not much mentioned, and\\nthe Suydams hope that posterity may recall\\nhim only as a gentle recluse who dabbled\\nin harmless magic and folk-lore.\\n\\nAs for Red Hookâ\\x80\\x94it is always the\\nsame.  Suydam came and went; a terror\\ngathered and faded; but the evil spirit of\\ndarkness and squalor broods on amongst\\nthe mongrels in the old brick houses; and\\nprowling bands still parade on unknown\\nerrands past windows where lights and\\ntwisted faces unaccountably appear and\\ndisappear.  Age-old horror is a hydra with a\\nthousand heads, and the cults of darkness\\nare rooted in blasphemies deeper than the\\nwell of Democritus.  The soul of the beast\\nis omnipresent and triumphant, and Red\\nHook\\'s legions of blear-eyed, pockmarked\\nyouths still chant and curse and howl\\nas they file from abyss to abyss, none knows\\nwhence or whither, pushed on by blind\\nlaws of biology which they may never\\nunderstand.  As of old more people enter\\nRed Hook than leave it on the landward\\nside, and there are already rumors of new\\ncanals running underground to certain\\ncenters of traffic in liquor and less\\nmentionable things.\\n\\nThe dance-hall church is now mostly a\\ndance-hall, and queer faces have appeared\\nat night at the windows.  Lately a policeman\\nexpressed the belief that the filled-up\\ncrypt has been dug out again, and for no\\nsimply explainable purpose.  Who are we\\nto combat poisons older than history and\\nmankind?  Apes danced in Asia to those\\nhorrors, and the cancer lurks secure and\\nspreading where furtiveness hides in rows\\nof decaying brick.\\n\\nMalone does not shudder without causeâ\\x80\\x94for\\nonly the other day an officer overheard\\na swarthy squinting hag teaching a small\\nchild some whispering patois in the shadow\\nof an areaway.  He listened, and thought\\nit very strange when he heard her repeat\\nover and over again:\\n\\n\"O friend and companion of night thou\\nwho rejoicest in the baying of dogs and\\nspilt blood, who wanderest in the midst\\nof shades among the tombs, who longest\\nfor blood and bringest terror to mortals,\\nGorgo, Mormo, thousand-faced moon, look\\nfavorably on our sacrifices!\"',\n",
