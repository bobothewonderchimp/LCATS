HOFFMANN PRICE\n\nA colossal story of cosmic scope by two of the greatest writers of\nweird fiction in the world today.\n\n\"Through the Gates of the Silver Key,\" published complete in this\nissue, is an utterly amazing novelette. It is much more than a mere\npiece of fiction, for it so far transcends human experiences, and even\nthe wildest dreams of human beings, that the ideas and thoughts set\nforth in the tale are titanic. One searches the dictionaries in vain\nfor words to describe this brilliant and astounding tale, which for\nsheer imaginative daring goes beyond anything ever printed before. It\nis the joint product of two of your most popular authors.\n\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Weird Tales July 1934.

From the far corners, where odd tripods\nof wrought iron were now and then replenished by an incredibly aged\nnegro in somber livery, came the hypnotic fumes of olibanum; while in\na deep niche on one side there ticked a curious, coffin-shaped clock\nwhose dial bore baffling hieroglyphs and whose four hands did not move\nin consonance with any time system known on this planet. It was a\nsingular and disturbing room, but well fitted to the business then at\nhand. For there, in the New Orleans home of this continent's greatest\nmystic, mathematician and orientalist, there was being settled at last\nthe estate of a scarcely less great mystic, scholar, author and dreamer\nwho had vanished from the face of the earth four years before.\n\nRandolph Carter, who had all his life sought to escape from the tedium\nand limitations of waking reality in the beckoning vistas of dreams\nand fabled avenues of other dimensions, disappeared from the sight\nof man on the seventh of October, 1928, at the age of fifty-four.\nHis career had been a strange and lonely one, and there were those\nwho inferred from his curious novels many episodes more bizarre than\nany in his recorded history. His association with Harley Warren, the\nSouth Carolina mystic whose studies in the primal Naacal language of\nthe Himalayan priests had led to such outrageous conclusions, had\nbeen close. Indeed, it was he who\u00e2\u0080\u0094one mist-mad, terrible night in an\nancient graveyard\u00e2\u0080\u0094had seen Warren descend into a dank and nitrous\nvault, never to emerge. Carter lived in Boston, but it was from the\nwild, haunted hills behind hoary and witch-accursed Arkham that all his\nforebears had come. And it was amid these ancient, cryptically brooding\nhills that he had ultimately vanished.\n\nHis old servant, Parks\u00e2\u0080\u0094who died early in 1930\u00e2\u0080\u0094had spoken of the\nstrangely aromatic and hideously carven box he had found in the attic,\nand of the undecipherable parchments and queerly figured silver key\nwhich that box had contained: matters of which Carter had also written\nto others. Carter, he said, had told him that this key had come down\nfrom his ancestors, and that it would help him to unlock the gates to\nhis lost boyhood, and to strange dimensions and fantastic realms which\nhe had hitherto visited only in vague, brief and elusive dreams. Then\none day Carter took the box and its contents and rode away in his car, never to return.\n\nLater on, people found the car at the side of an old, grass-grown\nroad in the hills behind crumbling Arkham\u00e2\u0080\u0094the hills where Carter's\nforebears had once dwelt, and where the ruined cellar of the great\nCarter homestead still gaped to the sky. It was in a grove of tall elms\nnear by that another of the Carters had mysteriously vanished in 1781,\nand not far away was the half-rotted cottage where Goody Fowler, the\nwitch, had brewed her ominous potions still earlier. The region had\nbeen settled in 1692 by fugitives from the witchcraft trials in Salem,\nand even now it bore a name for vaguely ominous things scarcely to be\nenvisaged. Edmund Carter had fled from the shadow of Gallows Hill just\nin time, and the tales of his sorceries were many. Now, it seemed, his\nlone descendant had gone somewhere to join him!\n\nIn the car they found the hideously carved box of fragrant wood,\nand the parchment which no man could read. The silver key was\ngone\u00e2\u0080\u0094presumably with Carter. Further than that there was no certain\nclue. Detectives from Boston said that the fallen timbers of the old\nCarter place seemed oddly disturbed, and somebody found a handkerchief\non the rock-ridged, sinisterly wooded slope behind the ruins near the\ndreaded cave called the Snake Den.\n\nIt was then that the country legends about the Snake Den gained a new\nvitality. Farmers whispered of the blasphemous uses to which old Edmund\nCarter the wizard had put that horrible grotto, and added later tales\nabout the fondness which Randolph Carter himself had had for it when\na boy. In Carter's boyhood the venerable gambrel-roofed homestead was\nstill standing and tenanted by his great-uncle Christopher. He had\nvisited there often, and had talked singularly about the Snake Den.\nPeople remembered what he had said about a deep fissure and an unknown\ninner cave beyond, and speculated on the change he had shown after\nspending one whole memorable day in the cavern when he was nine. That\nwas in October, too\u00e2\u0080\u0094and ever after that he had seemed to have an\nuncanny knack at prophesying future events.\n\nIt had rained late in the night that Carter vanished, and no one was\nquite able to trace his footprints from the car. Inside the Snake Den\nall was amorphous liquid mud, owing to the copious seepage. Only the\nignorant rustics whispered about the prints they thought they spied\nwhere the great elms overhang the road, and on the sinister hillside\nnear the Snake Den, where the handkerchief was found. Who could pay\nattention to whispers that spoke of stubby little tracks like those\nwhich Randolph Carter's square-toed boots made when he was a small boy?\nIt was as crazy a notion as that other whisper\u00e2\u0080\u0094that the tracks of old\nBenijah Corey's peculiar heelless boots had met the stubby little\ntracks in the road. Old Benijah had been the Carters' hired man when\nRandolph was young; but he had died thirty years ago.\n\nIt must have been these whispers\u00e2\u0080\u0094plus Carter's own statement to Parks\nand others that the queerly arabesqued silver key would help him unlock\nthe gates of his lost boyhood\u00e2\u0080\u0094which caused a number of mystical\nstudents to declare that the missing man had actually doubled back on\nthe trail of time and returned through forty-five years to that other\nOctober day in 1883 when he had stayed in the Snake Den as a small boy.\nWhen he came out that night, they argued, he had somehow made the whole\ntrip to 1928 and back; for did he not thereafter know of things which\nwere to happen later? And yet he had never spoken of anything to happen\nafter 1928.\n\nOne student\u00e2\u0080\u0094an elderly eccentric of Providence, Rhode Island, who\nhad enjoyed a long and close correspondence with Carter\u00e2\u0080\u0094had a still\nmore elaborate theory, and believed that Carter had not only returned\nto boyhood, but achieved a further liberation, roving at will through\nthe prismatic vistas of boyhood dream. After a strange vision this man\npublished a tale of Carter's vanishing in which he hinted that the lost\none now reigned as king on the opal throne of Ilek-Vad, that fabulous\ntown of turrets atop the hollow cliffs of glass overlooking the\ntwilight sea wherein the bearded and finny Gnorri build their singular\nlabyrinths.\n\nIt was this old man, Ward Phillips, who pleaded most loudly against the\napportionment of Carter's estate to his heirs\u00e2\u0080\u0094all distant cousins\u00e2\u0080\u0094on\nthe ground that he was still alive in another time-dimension and might\nwell return some day. Against him was arrayed the legal talent of\none of the cousins, Ernest K. Aspinwall of Chicago, a man ten years\nCarter's senior, but keen as a youth in forensic battles. For four\nyears the contest had raged, but now the time for apportionment had\ncome, and this vast, strange room in New Orleans was to be the scene of\nthe arrangements.\n\nIt was the home of Carter's literary and financial executor\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\ndistinguished Creole student of mysteries and Eastern antiquities,\nEtienne-Laurent de Marigny. Carter had met de Marigny during the war,\nwhen they both served in the French Foreign Legion, and had at once\ncleaved to him because of their similar tastes and outlook. When, on\na memorable joint furlough, the learned young Creole had taken the\nwistful Boston dreamer to Bayonne, in the south of France, and had\nshown him certain terrible secrets in the nighted and immemorial crypts\nthat burrow beneath that brooding, eon-weighted city, the friendship\nwas forever sealed. Carter's will had named de Marigny as executor, and\nnow that avid scholar was reluctantly presiding over the settlement of\nthe estate. It was sad work for him, for like the old Rhode Islander he\ndid not believe that Carter was dead. But what weight have the dreams\nof mystics against the harsh wisdom of the world?\n\nAround the table in that strange room in the old French Quarter sat\nthe men who claimed an interest in the proceedings. There had been\nthe usual legal advertisements of the conference in papers wherever\nCarter's heirs were thought to live; yet only four now sat listening\nto the abnormal ticking of that coffin-shaped clock which told no\nearthly time, and to the bubbling of the courtyard fountain beyond\nhalf-curtained, fan-lighted windows. As the hours wore on, the faces\nof the four were half shrouded in the curling fumes from the tripods,\nwhich, piled recklessly with fuel, seemed to need less and less\nattention from the silently gliding and increasingly nervous old negro.\n\nThere was Etienne de Marigny himself\u00e2\u0080\u0094slim, dark, handsome, mustached,\nand still young. Aspinwall, representing the heirs, was white-haired,\napoplectic-faced, side-whiskered, and portly. Phillips, the Providence\nmystic, was lean, gray, long-nosed, clean-shaven, and stoop-shouldered.\nThe fourth man was non-committal in age\u00e2\u0080\u0094lean, with a dark, bearded,\nsingularly immobile face of very regular contour, bound with the\nturban of a high-caste Brahman and having night-black, burning, almost\nirisless eyes which seemed to gaze out from a vast distance behind\nthe features. He had announced himself as the Swami Chandraputra, an\nadept from Benares, with important information to give; and both de\nMarigny and Phillips\u00e2\u0080\u0094who had corresponded with him\u00e2\u0080\u0094had been quick to\nrecognize the genuineness of his mystical pretensions. His speech had\nan oddly forced, hollow, metallic quality, as if the use of English\ntaxed his vocal apparatus; yet his language was as easy, correct and\nidiomatic as any native Anglo-Saxon's. In general attire he was the\nnormal European civilian, but his loose clothes sat peculiarly badly\non him, while his bushy black beard, Eastern turban, and large, white\nmittens gave him an air of exotic eccentricity.\n\nDe Marigny, fingering the parchment found in Carter's car, was speaking.\n\n\"No, I have not been able to make anything of the parchment. Mr.\nPhillips, here, also gives it up. Colonel Churchward declares it is\nnot Naacal, and it looks nothing at all like the hieroglyphics on that\nEaster Island war-club. The carvings on that box, though, do strongly\nsuggest Easter Island images. The nearest thing I can recall to these\nparchment characters\u00e2\u0080\u0094notice how all the letters seem to hang down\nfrom horizontal word-bars\u00e2\u0080\u0094is the writing in a book poor Harley Warren\nonce had. It came from India while Carter and I were visiting him in\n1919, and he never would tell us anything about it\u00e2\u0080\u0094said it would be\nbetter if we didn't know, and hinted that it might have come originally\nfrom some place other than the Earth. He took it with him in December,\nwhen he went down into the vault in that old graveyard\u00e2\u0080\u0094but neither\nhe nor the book ever came to the surface again. Some time ago I sent\nour friend here\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Swami Chandraputra\u00e2\u0080\u0094a memory-sketch of some of\nthose letters, and also a photostatic copy of the Carter parchment. He\nbelieves he may be able to shed light on them after certain references\nand consultations.\n\n\"But the key\u00e2\u0080\u0094Carter sent me a photograph of that. Its curious\narabesques were not letters, but seem to have belonged to the same\nculture-tradition as the parchment. Carter always spoke of being on\nthe point of solving the mystery, though he never gave details. Once\nhe grew almost poetic about the whole business. That antique silver\nkey, he said, would unlock the successive doors that bar our free\nmarch down the mighty corridors of space and time to the very Border\nwhich no man has crossed since Shaddad with his terrific genius\nbuilt and concealed in the sands of Arabia Petr\u00c3\u00a6a the prodigious\ndomes and uncounted minarets of thousand-pillared Irem. Half-starved\ndarvishes\u00e2\u0080\u0094wrote Carter\u00e2\u0080\u0094and thirst-crazed nomads have returned to tell\nof that monumental portal, and of the hand that is sculptured above the\nkeystone of the arch, but no man has passed and retraced his steps to\nsay that his footprints on the garnet-strown sands within bear witness\nto his visit. The key, he surmised, was that for which the cyclopean\nsculptured hand vainly grasps.\n\n\"Why Carter didn't take the parchment as well as the key, we can not\nsay. Perhaps he forgot it\u00e2\u0080\u0094or perhaps he forbore to take it through\nrecollection of one who had taken a book of like characters into a\nvault and never returned. Or perhaps it was really immaterial to what\nhe wished to do.\"\n\nAs de Marigny paused, old Mr. Phillips spoke in a harsh, shrill voice.\n\n\"We can know of Randolph Carter's wandering only what we dream. I have\nbeen to many strange places in dreams, and have heard many strange and\nsignificant things in Ulthar, beyond the River Skai. It does not appear\nthat the parchment was needed, for certainly Carter re-entered the\nworld of his boyhood dreams, and is now a king in Ilek-Vad.\"\n\nMr. Aspinwall grew doubly apoplectic-looking as he sputtered: \"Can't\nsomebody shut that old fool up? We've had enough of these moonings. The\nproblem is to divide the property, and it's about time we got to it.\"\n\nFor the first time Swami Chandraputra spoke in his queerly alien voice.\n\n\"Gentlemen, there is more to this matter than you think. Mr. Aspinwall\ndoes not do well to laugh at the evidence of dreams. Mr. Phillips has\ntaken an incomplete view\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps because he has not dreamed enough.\nI, myself, have done much dreaming. We in India have always done that,\njust as all the Carters seem to have done it. You, Mr. Aspinwall, as a\nmaternal cousin, are naturally not a Carter. My own dreams, and certain\nother sources of information, have told me a great deal which you\nstill find obscure. For example, Randolph Carter forgot that parchment\nwhich he couldn't decipher\u00e2\u0080\u0094yet it would have been well for him had he\nremembered to take it. You see, I have really learned pretty much what\nhappened to Carter after he left his car with the silver key at sunset\non that seventh of October, four years ago.\"\n\nAspinwall audibly sneered, but the others sat up with heightened\ninterest. The smoke from the tripods increased, and the crazy ticking\nof that coffin-shaped clock seemed to fall into bizarre patterns like\nthe dots and dashes of some alien and insoluble telegraph message\nfrom outer space. The Hindoo leaned back, half closed his eyes, and\ncontinued in that oddly labored yet idiomatic speech, while before\nhis audience there began to float a picture of what had happened to\nRandolph Carter.\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nThe hills beyond Arkham are full of a strange magic\u00e2\u0080\u0094something,\nperhaps, which the old wizard Edmund Carter called down from the stars\nand up from the crypts of nether earth when he fled there from Salem\nin 1692. As soon as Randolph Carter was back among them he knew that\nhe was close to one of the gates which a few audacious, abhorred and\nalien-souled men have blasted through titan walls betwixt the world\nand the outside absolute. Here, he felt, and on this day of the year,\nhe could carry out with success the message he had deciphered months\nbefore from the arabesques of that tarnished and incredibly ancient\nsilver key. He knew now how it must be rotated, and how it must be held\nup to the setting sun, and what syllables of ceremony must be intoned\ninto the void at the ninth and last turning. In a spot as close to\na dark polarity and induced gate as this, it could not fail in its\nprimary functions. Certainly, he would rest that night in the lost\nboyhood for which he had never ceased to mourn.\n\nHe got out of the car with the key in his pocket, walking up-hill\ndeeper and deeper into the shadowy core of that brooding, haunted\ncountryside of winding road, vine-grown stone wall, black woodland,\ngnarled, neglected orchard, gaping-windowed, deserted farmhouse, and\nnameless ruin. At the sunset hour, when the distant spires of Kingsport\ngleamed in the ruddy blaze, he took out the key and made the needed\nturnings and intonations. Only later did he realize how soon the ritual\nhad taken effect.\n\nThen in the deepening twilight he had heard a voice out of the past:\nOld Benijah Corey, his great-uncle's hired man. Had not old Benijah\nbeen dead for thirty years? Thirty years before when ? What was time?\nWhere had he been? Why was it strange that Benijah should be calling\nhim on this seventh of October, 1883? Was he not out later than Aunt\nMartha had told him to stay? What was this key in his blouse pocket,\nwhere his little telescope\u00e2\u0080\u0094given him by his father on his ninth\nbirthday, two months before\u00e2\u0080\u0094ought to be? Had he found it in the attic\nat home? Would it unlock the mystic pylon which his sharp eye had\ntraced amidst the jagged rocks at the back of that inner cave behind\nthe Snake Den on the hill? That was the place they always coupled with\nold Edmund Carter the wizard. People wouldn't go there, and nobody but\nhim had ever noticed or squirmed through the root-choked fissure to\nthat great black inner chamber with the pylon. Whose hands had carved\nthat hint of a pylon out of the living rock? Old Wizard Edmund's\u00e2\u0080\u0094or others that he had conjured up and commanded?\n\nThat evening little Randolph ate supper with Uncle Chris and Aunt\nMartha in the old gambrel-roofed farmhouse.\n\nNext morning he was up early and out through the twisted-boughed apple\norchard to the upper timber-lot where the mouth of the Snake Den\nlurked black and forbidding amongst grotesque, over-nourished oaks. A\nnameless expectancy was upon him, and he did not even notice the loss\nof his handkerchief as he fumbled in his blouse pocket to see if the\nqueer silver key was safe. He crawled through the dark orifice with\ntense, adventurous assurance, lighting his way with matches taken\nfrom the sitting-room. In another moment he had wriggled through the\nroot-choked fissure at the farther end, and was in the vast, unknown\ninner grotto whose ultimate rock wall seemed half like a monstrous and\nconsciously shapen pylon. Before that dank, dripping wall he stood\nsilent and awestruck, lighting one match after another as he gazed.\nWas that stony bulge above the keystone of the imagined arch really a\ngigantic sculptured hand? Then he drew forth the silver key, and made\nmotions and intonations whose source he could only dimly remember. Was\nanything forgotten? He knew only that he wished to cross the barrier to\nthe untrammelled land of his dreams and the gulfs where all dimensions\ndissolved in the absolute.\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nWhat happened then is scarcely to be described in words. It is full of\nthose paradoxes, contradictions and anomalies which have no place in\nwaking life, but which fill our more fantastic dreams and are taken as\nmatters of course till we return to our narrow, rigid, objective world\nof limited causation and tri-dimensional logic. As the Hindoo continued\nhis tale, he had difficulty in avoiding what seemed\u00e2\u0080\u0094even more than\nthe notion of a man transferred through the years to boyhood\u00e2\u0080\u0094an air\nof trivial, puerile extravagance. Mr. Aspinwall, in disgust, gave an\napoplectic snort and virtually stopped listening.\n\nFor the rite of the silver key, as practised by Randolph Carter in that\nblack, haunted cave within a cave, did not prove unavailing. From the\nfirst gesture and syllable an aura of strange, awesome mutation was\napparent\u00e2\u0080\u0094a sense of incalculable disturbance and confusion in time\nand space, yet one which held no hint of what we recognize as motion\nand duration. Imperceptibly, such things as age and location ceased\nto have any significance whatever. The day before, Randolph Carter\nhad miraculously leaped a gulf of years. Now there was no distinction\nbetween boy and man. There was only the entity Randolph Carter, with a\ncertain store of images which had lost all connection with terrestrial\nscenes and circumstances of acquisition. A moment before, there had\nbeen an inner cave with vague suggestions of a monstrous arch and\ngigantic sculptured hand on the farther wall. Now there was neither\ncave nor absence of cave; neither wall nor absence of wall. There was\nonly a flux of impressions not so much visual as cerebral, amidst\nwhich the entity that was Randolph Carter experienced perceptions or\nregistrations of all that his mind revolved on, yet without any clear\nconsciousness of the way in which he received them.\n\nBy the time the rite was over, Carter knew that he was in no region\nwhose place could be told by Earth's geographers, and in no age whose\ndate history could fix; for the nature of what was happening was not\nwholly unfamiliar to him. There were hints of it in the cryptical\nPnakotic fragments, and a whole chapter in the forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab, Abdul Alhazred, had taken on significance when he\nhad deciphered the designs graven on the silver key. A gate had been\nunlocked\u00e2\u0080\u0094not, indeed, the Ultimate Gate, but one leading from Earth\nand time to that extension of Earth which is outside time, and from\nwhich in turn the Ultimate Gate leads fearsomely and perilously to the\nLast Void which is outside all earths, all universes, and all matter.\n\nThere would be a Guide\u00e2\u0080\u0094and a very terrible one; a Guide who had been\nan entity of Earth millions of years before, when man was undreamed of,\nand when forgotten shapes moved on a steaming planet building strange\ncities among whose last, crumbling ruins the first mammals were to\nplay. Carter remembered what the monstrous Necronomicon had vaguely\nand disconcertingly adumbrated concerning that Guide:\n\n\" And while there are those ,\" the mad Arab had written, \" who have\ndared to seek glimpses beyond the Veil, and to accept HIM as guide,\nthey would have been more prudent had they avoided commerce with HIM;\nfor it is written in the Book of Thoth how terrific is the price of\na single glimpse. Nor may those who pass ever return, for in the\nvastnesses transcending our world are shapes of darkness that seize\nand bind. The Affair that shambleth about in the night, the evil that\ndefieth the Elder Sign, the Herd that stand watch at the secret portal\neach tomb is known to have, and that thrive on that which groweth out\nof the tenants thereof:\u00e2\u0080\u0094all these Blacknesses are lesser than HE WHO\nguardeth the Gateway: HE WHO will guide the rash one beyond all the\nworlds into the Abyss of unnamable devourers. For HE is 'UMR AT-TAWIL,\nthe Most Ancient One, which the scribe rendereth as THE PROLONGED OF\nLIFE. \"\n\nMemory and imagination shaped dim half-pictures with uncertain outlines\namidst the seething chaos, but Carter knew that they were of memory and\nimagination only. Yet he felt that it was not chance which built these\nthings in his consciousness, but rather some vast reality, ineffable\nand undimensioned, which surrounded him and strove to translate itself\ninto the only symbols he was capable of grasping. For no mind of Earth\nmay grasp the extensions of shape which interweave in the oblique gulfs\noutside time and the dimensions we know.\n\nThere floated before Carter a cloudy pageantry of shapes and scenes\nwhich he somehow linked with Earth's primal, eon-forgotten past.\nMonstrous living things moved deliberately through vistas of fantastic\nhandiwork that no sane dream ever held, and landscapes bore incredible\nvegetation and cliffs and mountains and masonry of no human pattern.\nThere were cities under the sea, and denizens thereof; and towers in\ngreat deserts where globes and cylinders and nameless winged entities\nshot off into space, or hurtled down out of space. All this Carter\ngrasped, though the images bore no fixed relation to one another or to\nhim. He himself had no stable form or position, but only such shifting\nhints of form and position as his whirling fancy supplied.\n\nHe had wished to find the enchanted regions of his boyhood dreams,\nwhere galleys sail up the river Oukranos past the gilded spires of\nThran, and elephant caravans tramp through perfumed jungles in Kled,\nbeyond forgotten palaces with veined ivory columns that sleep lovely\nand unbroken under the moon. Now, intoxicated with wider visions, he\nscarcely knew what he sought. Thoughts of infinite and blasphemous\ndaring rose in his mind, and he knew he would face the dreaded Guide\nwithout fear, asking monstrous and terrible things of him.\n\nAll at once the pageant of impressions seemed to achieve a vague kind\nof stabilization. There were great masses of towering stone, carven\ninto alien and incomprehensible designs and disposed according to\nthe laws of some unknown, inverse geometry. Light filtered down from\na sky of no assignable color in baffling, contradictory directions,\nand played almost sentiently over what seemed to be a curved line of\ngigantic hieroglyphed pedestals more hexagonal than otherwise, and\nsurmounted by cloaked, ill-defined shapes.\n\nThere was another shape, too, which occupied no pedestal, but which\nseemed to glide or float over the cloudy, floor-like lower level. It\nwas not exactly permanent in outline, but held transient suggestions of\nsomething remotely preceding or paralleling the human form, though half\nas large again as an ordinary man. It seemed to be heavily cloaked,\nlike the shapes on the pedestals, with some neutral-colored fabric;\nand Carter could not detect any eye-holes through which it might gaze.\nProbably it did not need to gaze, for it seemed to belong to an order\nof beings far outside the merely physical in organization and faculties.\n\nA moment later Carter knew that this was so, for the Shape had spoken\nto his mind without sound or language. And though the name it uttered\nwas a dreaded and terrible one, Randolph Carter did not flinch in fear.\nInstead, he spoke back, equally without sound or language, and made\nthose obeisances which the hideous Necronomicon had taught him to\nmake. For this shape was nothing less than that which all the world has\nfeared since Lomar rose out of the sea, and the Children of the Fire\nMist came to Earth to teach the Elder Lore to man. It was indeed the\nfrightful Guide and Guardian of the Gate\u00e2\u0080\u0094'UMR AT-TAWIL, the ancient\none, which the scribe rendereth the PROLONGED OF LIFE.\n\nThe Guide knew, as he knew all things, of Carter's quest and coming,\nand that this seeker of dreams and secrets stood before him unafraid.\nThere was no horror or malignity in what he radiated, and Carter\nwondered for a moment whether the mad Arab's terrific blasphemous hints\ncame from envy and a baffled wish to do what was now about to be done.\nOr perhaps the Guide reserved his horror and malignity for those who\nfeared. As the radiations continued, Carter eventually interpreted them\nin the form of words.\n\n\"I am indeed that Most Ancient One,\" said the Guide, \"of whom you know.\nWe have awaited you\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Ancient Ones and I. You are welcome, even\nthough long delayed. You have the key, and have unlocked the First\nGate. Now the Ultimate Gate is ready for your trial. If you fear, you\nneed not advance. You may still go back unharmed, the way you came. But\nif you choose to advance\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\nThe pause was ominous, but the radiations continued to be friendly.\nCarter hesitated not a moment, for a burning curiosity drove him on.\n\n\"I will advance,\" he radiated back, \"and I accept you as my Guide.\"\n\nAt this reply the Guide seemed to make a sign by certain motions of his\nrobe which may or may not have involved the lifting of an arm or some\nhomologous member. A second sign followed, and from his well-learned\nlore Carter knew that he was at last very close to the Ultimate Gate.\nThe light now changed to another inexplicable color, and the shapes on\nthe quasi-hexagonal pedestals became more clearly defined. As they sat\nmore erect, their outlines became more like those of men, though Carter\nknew that they could not be men. Upon their cloaked heads there now\nseemed to rest tall, uncertainly colored miters, strangely suggestive\nof those on certain nameless figures chiselled by a forgotten sculptor\nalong the living cliffs of a high, forbidden mountain in Tartary; while\ngrasped in certain folds of their swathings were long scepters whose\ncarven heads bodied forth a grotesque and archaic mystery.\n\nCarter guessed what they were and whence they came, and Whom they\nserved; and guessed, too, the price of their service. But he was still\ncontent, for at one mighty venture he was to learn all. Damnation, he\nreflected, is but a word bandied about by those whose blindness leads\nthem to condemn all who can see, even with a single eye. He wondered at\nthe vast conceit of those who had babbled of the malignant Ancient\nOnes, as if They could pause from their everlasting dreams to wreak a\nwrath on mankind. As well, he thought, might a mammoth pause to visit\nfrantic vengeance on an angleworm. Now the whole assemblage on the\nvaguely hexagonal pillars was greeting him with a gesture of those\noddly carven scepters and radiating a message which he understood:\n\n\"We salute you, Most Ancient One, and you, Randolph Carter, whose\ndaring has made you one of us.\"\n\nCarter saw now that one of the pedestals was vacant, and a gesture\nof the Most Ancient One told him it was reserved for him. He saw\nalso another pedestal, taller than the rest, and at the center of\nthe oddly curved line\u00e2\u0080\u0094neither semicircle nor ellipse, parabola nor\nhyperbola\u00e2\u0080\u0094which they formed. This, he guessed, was the Guide's own\nthrone. Moving and rising in a manner hardly definable, Carter took his\nseat; and as he did so he saw that the Guide had seated himself.\n\nGradually and mistily it became apparent that the Most Ancient One\nwas holding something\u00e2\u0080\u0094some object clutched in the outflung folds of\nhis robe as if for the sight, or what answered for sight, of the\ncloaked Companions. It was a large sphere, or apparent sphere, of\nsome obscurely iridescent metal, and as the Guide put it forward a\nlow, pervasive half-impression of sound began to rise and fall in\nintervals which seemed to be rhythmic even though they followed no\nrhythm of Earth. There was a suggestion of chanting\u00e2\u0080\u0094or what human\nimagination might interpret as chanting. Presently the quasi-sphere\nbegan to grow luminous, and as it gleamed up into a cold, pulsating\nlight of unassignable color, Carter saw that its flickerings conformed\nto the alien rhythm of the chant. Then all the mitered, scepter-bearing\nShapes on the pedestals commenced a slight, curious swaying in the same\ninexplicable rhythm, while nimbuses of unclassifiable light\u00e2\u0080\u0094resembling\nthat of the quasi-sphere\u00e2\u0080\u0094played around their shrouded heads.\n\nThe Hindoo paused in his tale and looked curiously at the tall,\ncoffin-shaped clock with the four hands and hieroglyphed dial, whose\ncrazy ticking followed no known rhythm of Earth.\n\n\"You, Mr. de Marigny,\" he suddenly said to his learned host, \"do not\nneed to be told the particularly alien rhythm to which those cowled\nShapes on the hexagonal pillars chanted and nodded. You are the only\none else\u00e2\u0080\u0094in America\u00e2\u0080\u0094who has had a taste of the Outer Extension. That\nclock\u00e2\u0080\u0094I suppose it was sent you by the Yogi poor Harley Warren used\nto talk about\u00e2\u0080\u0094the seer who said that he alone of living men had been\nto Yian-Ho, the hidden legacy of eon-old Leng, and had borne certain\nthings away from that dreadful and forbidden city. I wonder how many of\nits subtler properties you know? If my dreams and readings be correct,\nit was made by those who knew much of the First Gateway. But let me go\non with my tale.\"\n\nAt last, continued the Swami, the swaying and the suggestion of\nchanting ceased, the lambent nimbuses around the now drooping and\nmotionless heads faded, while the cloaked shapes slumped curiously on\ntheir pedestals. The quasi-sphere, however, continued to pulsate with\ninexplicable light. Carter felt that the Ancient Ones were sleeping\nas they had been when he first saw them, and he wondered out of what\ncosmic dreams his coming had aroused them. Slowly there filtered into\nhis mind the truth that this strange chanting ritual had been one of\ninstruction, and that the Companions had been chanted by the Most\nAncient One into a new and peculiar kind of sleep in order that their\ndreams might open the Ultimate Gate to which the silver key was a\npassport. He knew that in the profundity of this deep sleep they were\ncontemplating unplumbed vastnesses of utter and absolute outsideness,\nand that they were to accomplish that which his presence had demanded.\n\nThe Guide did not share this sleep, but seemed still to be giving\ninstructions in some subtle, soundless way. Evidently he was implanting\nimages of those things which he wished the Companions to dream: and\nCarter knew that as each of the Ancient Ones pictured the prescribed\nthought, there would be born the nucleus of a manifestation visible\nto his earthly eyes. When the dreams of all the Shapes had achieved a\noneness, that manifestation would occur, and everything he required\nbe materialized, through concentration. He had seen such things on\nEarth\u00e2\u0080\u0094in India, where the combined, projected will of a circle of\nadepts can make a thought take tangible substance, and in hoary\nAtlaan\u00c3\u00a2t, of which few even dare speak.\n\nJust what the Ultimate Gate was, and how it was to be passed, Carter\ncould not be certain; but a feeling of tense expectancy surged over\nhim. He was conscious of having a kind of body, and of holding the\nfateful silver key in his hand. The masses of towering stone opposite\nhim seemed to possess the evenness of a wall, toward the center of\nwhich his eyes were irresistibly drawn. And then suddenly he felt the\nmental currents of the Most Ancient One cease to flow forth.\n\nFor the first time Carter realized how terrific utter silence, mental\nand physical, may be. The earlier moments had never failed to contain\nsome perceptible rhythm, if only the faint, cryptical pulse of the\nEarth's dimensional extension, but now the hush of the abyss seemed\nto fall upon everything. Despite his intimations of body, he had no\naudible breath; and the glow of 'Umr at-Tawil's quasi-sphere had grown\npetrifiedly fixed and unpulsating. A potent nimbus, brighter than those\nwhich had played round the heads of the Shapes, blazed frozenly over\nthe shrouded skull of the terrible Guide.\n\nA dizziness assailed Carter, and his sense of lost orientation waxed\na thousandfold. The strange lights seemed to hold the quality of the\nmost impenetrable blacknesses heaped upon blacknesses, while about\nthe Ancient Ones, so close on their pseudo-hexagonal thrones, there\nhovered an air of the most stupefying remoteness. Then he felt himself\nwafted into immeasurable depths, with waves of perfumed warmth lapping\nagainst his face. It was as if he floated in a torrid, rose-tinctured\nsea; a sea of drugged wine whose waves broke foaming against shores of\nbrazen fire. A great fear clutched him as he half saw that vast expanse\nof surging sea lapping against its far-off coast. But the moment of\nsilence was broken\u00e2\u0080\u0094the surgings were speaking to him in a language\nthat was not of physical sound or articulate words.\n\n\" The Man of Truth is beyond good and evil ,\" intoned a voice that was\nnot a voice. \" The Man of Truth has ridden to All-Is-One. The Man of\nTruth has learned that Illusion is the One Reality, and that Substance\nis the Great Impostor. \"\n\nAnd now, in that rise of masonry to which his eyes had been so\nirresistibly drawn, there appeared the outline of a titanic arch not\nunlike that which he thought he had glimpsed so long ago in that cave\nwithin a cave, on the far, unreal surface of the three-dimensioned\nEarth. He realized that he had been using the silver key\u00e2\u0080\u0094moving it in\naccord with an unlearned and instinctive ritual closely akin to that\nwhich had opened the Inner Gate. That rose-drunken sea which lapped\nhis cheeks was, he realized, no more or less than the adamantine mass\nof the solid wall yielding before his spell, and the vortex of thought\nwith which the Ancient Ones had aided his spell. Still guided by\ninstinct and blind determination, he floated forward\u00e2\u0080\u0094and through the\nUltimate Gate.\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nRandolph Carter's advance through that cyclopean bulk of masonry was\nlike a dizzy precipitation through the measureless gulfs between the\nstars. From a great distance he felt triumphant, god-like surges of\ndeadly sweetness, and after that the rustling of great wings, and\nimpressions of sound like the chirpings and murmurings of objects\nunknown on Earth or in the solar system. Glancing backward, he saw not\none gate alone, but a multiplicity of gates, at some of which clamored\nForms he strove not to remember.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, he felt a greater terror than that which any of the\nForms could give\u00e2\u0080\u0094a terror from which he could not flee because it was\nconnected with himself. Even the First Gateway had taken something of\nstability from him, leaving him uncertain about his bodily form and\nabout his relationship to the mistily defined objects around him, but\nit had not disturbed his sense of unity. He had still been Randolph\nCarter, a fixed point in the dimensional seething. Now, beyond the\nUltimate Gateway, he realized in a moment of consuming fright that he\nwas not one person, but many persons.\n\nHe was in many places at the same time. On Earth, on October 7, 1883,\na little boy named Randolph Carter was leaving the Snake Den in the\nhushed evening light and running down the rocky slope, and through\nthe twisted-boughed orchard toward his Uncle Christopher's house in\nthe hills beyond Arkham; yet at that same moment, which was also\nsomehow in the earthly year of 1928, a vague shadow not less Randolph\nCarter was sitting on a pedestal among the Ancient Ones in Earth's\ntransdimensional extension. Here, too, was a third Randolph Carter,\nin the unknown and formless cosmic abyss beyond the Ultimate Gate.\nAnd elsewhere, in a chaos of scenes whose infinite multiplicity and\nmonstrous diversity brought him close to the brink of madness, were a\nlimitless confusion of beings which he knew were as much himself as the\nlocal manifestation now beyond the Ultimate Gate.\n\nThere were Carters in settings belonging to every known and suspected\nage of Earth's history, and to remoter ages of earthly entity\ntranscending knowledge, suspicion, and credibility; Carters of forms\nboth human and non-human, vertebrate and invertebrate, conscious and\nmindless, animal and vegetable. And more, there were Carters having\nnothing in common with earthly life, but moving outrageously amidst\nbackgrounds of other planets and systems and galaxies and cosmic\ncontinua; spores of eternal life drifting from world to world, universe\nto universe, yet all equally himself. Some of the glimpses recalled\ndreams\u00e2\u0080\u0094both faint and vivid, single and persistent\u00e2\u0080\u0094which he had\nhad through the long years since he first began to dream; and a few\npossessed a haunting, fascinating and almost horrible familiarity which\nno earthly logic could explain.\n\nFaced with this realization, Randolph Carter reeled in the clutch\nof supreme horror\u00e2\u0080\u0094horror such as had not been hinted even at the\nclimax of that hideous night when two had ventured into an ancient\nand abhorred necropolis under a waning moon and only one had emerged.\nNo death, no doom, no anguish can arouse the surpassing despair which\nflows from a loss of identity . Merging with nothingness is peaceful\noblivion; but to be aware of existence and yet to know that one is no\nlonger a definite being distinguished from other beings\u00e2\u0080\u0094that one no\nlonger has a self \u00e2\u0080\u0094that is the nameless summit of agony and dread.\n\nHe knew that there had been a Randolph Carter of Boston, yet could\nnot be sure whether he\u00e2\u0080\u0094the fragment or facet of an entity beyond the\nUltimate Gate\u00e2\u0080\u0094had been that one or some other. His self had been\nannihilated; and yet he\u00e2\u0080\u0094if indeed there could, in view of that utter\nnullity of individual existence, be such a thing as he \u00e2\u0080\u0094was equally\naware of being in some inconceivable way a legion of selves. It was\nas though his body had been suddenly transformed into one of those\nmany-limbed and many-headed effigies sculptured in Indian temples, and\nhe contemplated the aggregation in a bewildered attempt to discern\nwhich was the original and which the additions\u00e2\u0080\u0094if indeed (supremely\nmonstrous thought!) there were any original as distinguished from\nother embodiments.\n\nThen, in the midst of these devastating reflections, Carter's\nbeyond-the-gate fragment was hurled from what had seemed the nadir of\nhorror to black, clutching pits of a horror still more profound. This\ntime it was largely external\u00e2\u0080\u0094a force or personality which at once\nconfronted and surrounded and pervaded him, and which in addition to\nits local presence, seemed also to be a part of himself, and likewise\nto be co-existent with all time and conterminous with all space. There\nwas no visual image, yet the sense of entity and the awful concept of\ncombined localism and identity and infinity lent a paralyzing terror\nbeyond anything which any Carter-fragment had hitherto deemed capable\nof existing.\n\nIn the face of that awful wonder, the quasi-Carter forgot the horror\nof destroyed individuality. It was an All-in-One and One-in-All\nof limitless being and self\u00e2\u0080\u0094not merely a thing of one space-time\ncontinuum, but allied to the ultimate animating essence of existence's\nwhole unbounded sweep\u00e2\u0080\u0094the last, utter sweep which has no confines and\nwhich outreaches fancy and mathematics alike. It was perhaps that which\ncertain secret cults of Earth had whispered of as Yog-Sothoth , and\nwhich has been a deity under other names; that which the crustaceans\nof Yuggoth worship as the Beyond-One, and which the vaporous brains of\nthe spiral nebul\u00c3\u00a6 know by an untranslatable sign\u00e2\u0080\u0094yet in a flash the\nCarter-facet realized how slight and fractional all these conceptions\nare.\n\nAnd now the Being was addressing the Carter-facet in prodigious waves\nthat smote and burned and thundered\u00e2\u0080\u0094a concentration of energy that\nblasted its recipient with well-nigh unendurable violence, and that\nparalleled in an unearthly rhythm the curious swaying of the Ancient\nOnes, and the flickering of the monstrous lights, in that baffling\nregion beyond the First Gate. It was as though suns and worlds and\nuniverses had converged upon one point whose very position in space\nthey had conspired to annihilate with an impact of resistless fury. But\namidst the greater terror one lesser terror was diminished; for the\nsearing waves appeared somehow to isolate the Beyond-the-Gate Carter\nfrom his infinity of duplicates\u00e2\u0080\u0094to restore, as it were, a certain\namount of the illusion of identity. After a time the hearer began to\ntranslate the waves into speech-forms known to him, and his sense of\nhorror and oppression waned. Fright became pure awe, and what had\nseemed blasphemously abnormal seemed now only ineffably majestic.\n\n\"Randolph Carter,\" it seemed to say, \"my manifestations on your\nplanet's extension, the Ancient Ones, have sent you as one who would\nlately have returned to small lands of dream which he had lost, yet\nwho with greater freedom has risen to greater and nobler desires and\ncuriosities. You wished to sail up golden Oukranos, to search out\nforgotten ivory cities in orchid-heavy Kled, and to reign on the opal\nthrone of Ilek-Vad, whose fabulous towers and numberless domes rise\nmighty toward a single red star in a filament alien to your Earth and\nto all matter. Now, with the passing of two Gates, you wish loftier\nthings. You would not flee like a child from a scene disliked to a\ndream beloved, but would plunge like a man into that last and inmost of\nsecrets which lies behind all scenes and dreams.\n\n\"What you wish, I have found good; and I am ready to grant that which\nI have granted eleven times only to beings of your planet\u00e2\u0080\u0094five times\nonly to those you call men, or those resembling them. I am ready to\nshow you the Ultimate Mystery, to look on which is to blast a feeble\nspirit. Yet before you gaze full at that last and first of secrets you\nmay still wield a free choice, and return if you will through the two\nGates with the Veil still unrent before your eyes.\"\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\nA sudden shutting-off of the waves left Carter in a chilling and\nawesome silence full of the spirit of desolation. On every hand pressed\nthe illimitable vastness of the void; yet the seeker knew that the\nBeing was still there. After a moment he thought of words whose mental\nsubstance he flung into the abyss: \"I accept. I will not retreat.\"\n\nThe waves surged forth again, and Carter knew that the Being had heard.\nAnd now there poured from that limitless Mind a flood of knowledge and\nexplanation which opened new vistas to the seeker, and prepared him\nfor such a grasp of the cosmos as he had never hoped to possess. He\nwas told how childish and limited is the notion of a tri-dimensional\nworld, and what an infinity of directions there are besides the known\ndirections of up-down, forward-backward, right-left. He was shown the\nsmallness and tinsel emptiness of the little Earth gods, with their\npetty, human interests and connections\u00e2\u0080\u0094their hatreds, rages, loves and\nvanities; their craving for praise and sacrifice, and their demands for\nfaiths contrary to reason and nature.\n\nWhile most of the impressions translated themselves to Carter as words,\nthere were others to which other senses gave interpretation. Perhaps\nwith eyes and perhaps with imagination he perceived that he was in a\nregion of dimensions beyond those conceivable to the eye and brain of\nman. He saw now, in the brooding shadows of that which had been first\na vortex of power and then an illimitable void, a sweep of creation\nthat dizzied his senses. From some inconceivable vantage-point he\nlooked upon prodigious forms whose multiple extensions transcended any\nconception of being, size and boundaries which his mind had hitherto\nbeen able to hold, despite a lifetime of cryptical study. He began to\nunderstand dimly why there could exist at the same time the little boy\nRandolph Carter in the Arkham farmhouse in 1883, the misty form on the\nvaguely hexagonal pillar beyond the First Gate, the fragment now facing\nthe Presence in the limitless abyss, and all the other Carters his\nfancy or perception envisaged.\n\nThen the waves increased in strength and sought to improve his\nunderstanding, reconciling him to the multiform entity of which his\npresent fragment was an infinitesimal part. They told him that every\nfigure of space is but the result of the intersection by a plane of\nsome corresponding figure of one more dimension\u00e2\u0080\u0094as a square is cut\nfrom a cube, or a circle from a sphere. The cube and sphere, of three\ndimensions, are thus cut from corresponding forms of four dimensions,\nwhich men know only through guesses and dreams; and these in turn\nare cut from forms of five dimensions, and so on up to the dizzy and\nreachless heights of archetypal infinity. The world of men and of\nthe gods of men is merely an infinitesimal phase of an infinitesimal\nthing\u00e2\u0080\u0094the three-dimensional phase of that small wholeness reached\nby the First Gate, where Umr at-Tawil dictates dreams to the\nAncient Ones. Though men hail it as reality, and brand thoughts of\nits many-dimensioned original as unreality, it is in truth the very\nopposite. That which we call substance and reality is shadow and\nillusion, and that which we call shadow and illusion is substance and\nreality.\n\nTime, the waves went on, is motionless, and without beginning or end.\nThat it has motion and is the cause of change is an illusion. Indeed,\nit is itself really an illusion, for except to the narrow sight of\nbeings in limited dimensions there are no such things as past, present\nand future. Men think of time only because of what they call change,\nyet that too is illusion. All that was, and is, and is to be, exists\nsimultaneously.\n\nThese revelations came with a god-like solemnity which left Carter\nunable to doubt. Even though they lay almost beyond his comprehension,\nhe felt that they must be true in the light of that final cosmic\nreality which belies all local perspectives and narrow partial views;\nand he was familiar enough with profound speculations to be free from\nthe bondage of local and partial conceptions. Had his whole quest not\nbeen based upon a faith in the unreality of the local and partial?\n\nAfter an impressive pause the waves continued, saying that what the\ndenizens of few-dimensioned zones call change is merely a function\nof their consciousness, which views the external world from various\ncosmic angles. As the Shapes produced by the cutting of a cone seem to\nvary with the angles of cutting\u00e2\u0080\u0094being circle, ellipse, parabola or\nhyperbola according to that angle, yet without any change in the cone\nitself\u00e2\u0080\u0094so do the local aspects of an unchanged and endless reality\nseem to change with the cosmic angle of regarding. To this variety\nof angles of consciousness the feeble beings of the inner worlds are\nslaves, since with rare exceptions they can not learn to control them.\nOnly a few students of forbidden things have gained inklings of this\ncontrol, and have thereby conquered time and change. But the entities\noutside the Gates command all angles, and view the myriad parts of the\ncosmos in terms of fragmentary change-involving perspective, or of the\nchangeless totality beyond perspective, in accordance with their will.\n\nAs the waves paused again, Carter began to comprehend, vaguely\nand terrifiedly, the ultimate background of that riddle of lost\nindividuality which had at first so horrified him. His intuition pieced\ntogether the fragments of revelation, and brought him closer and closer\nto a grasp of the secret. He understood that much of the frightful\nrevelation would have come upon him\u00e2\u0080\u0094splitting up his ego amongst\nmyriads of earthly counterparts\u00e2\u0080\u0094inside the First Gate, had not the\nmagic of 'Umr at-Tawil kept it from him in order that he might use the\nsilver key with precision for the Ultimate Gate's opening. Anxious for\nclearer knowledge, he sent out waves of thought, asking more of the\nexact relationship between his various facets\u00e2\u0080\u0094the fragment now beyond\nthe Ultimate Gate, the fragment still on the quasi-hexagonal pedestal\nbeyond the First Gate, the boy of 1883, the man of 1928, the various\nancestral beings who had formed his heritage and the bulwark of his\nego, and the nameless denizens of the other eons and other worlds which\nthat first hideous flash of ultimate perception had identified with\nhim. Slowly the waves of the Being surged out in reply, trying to make\nplain what was almost beyond the reach of an earthly mind.\n\nAll descended lines of beings of the finite dimensions, continued\nthe waves, and all stages of growth in each one of these beings, are\nmerely manifestations of one archetypal and eternal being in the space\noutside dimensions. Each local being\u00e2\u0080\u0094son, father, grandfather, and so\non\u00e2\u0080\u0094and each stage of individual being\u00e2\u0080\u0094infant, child, boy, man\u00e2\u0080\u0094is\nmerely one of the infinite phases of that same archetypal and eternal\nbeing, caused by a variation in the angle of the consciousness-plane\nwhich cuts it. Randolph Carter at all ages; Randolph Carter and all his\nancestors, both human and pre-human, terrestrial and pre-terrestrial;\nall these were only phases of one ultimate, eternal \"Carter\" outside\nspace and time\u00e2\u0080\u0094phantom projections differentiated only by the angle at\nwhich the plane of consciousness happened to cut the eternal archetype\nin each case.\n\nA slight change of angle could turn the student of today into the\nchild of yesterday; could turn Randolph Carter into that wizard,\nEdmund Carter who fled from Salem to the hills behind Arkham in 1692,\nor that Pickman Carter who in the year 2169 would use strange means\nin repelling the Mongol hordes from Australia; could turn a human\nCarter into one of those earlier entities which had dwelt in primal\nHyperborea and worshipped black, plastic Tsathoggua after flying down\nfrom Kythamil, the double planet that once revolved around Arcturus;\ncould turn a terrestrial Carter to a remotely ancestral and doubtfully\nshaped dweller on Kythamil itself, or a still remoter creature of\ntrans-galactic Stronti, or a four-dimensioned gaseous consciousness in\nan older space-time continuum, or a vegetable brain of the future on a\ndark, radio-active comet of inconceivable orbit\u00e2\u0080\u0094and so on, in endless\ncosmic cycle.\n\nThe archetypes, throbbed the waves, are the people of the Ultimate\nAbyss\u00e2\u0080\u0094formless, ineffable, and guessed at only by rare dreamers on\nthe low-dimensioned worlds. Chief among such was this informing Being\nitself ... which indeed was Carter's own archetype . The glutless zeal\nof Carter and all his forebears for forbidden cosmic secrets was a\nnatural result of derivation from the Supreme Archetype. On every world\nall great wizards, all great thinkers, all great artists, are facets of\nIt.\n\nAlmost stunned with awe, and with a kind of terrifying delight,\nRandolph Carter's consciousness did homage to that transcendent Entity\nfrom which it was derived. As the waves paused again he pondered in the\nmighty silence, thinking of strange tributes, stranger questions, and\nstill stranger requests. Curious concepts flowed conflictingly through\na brain dazed with unaccustomed vistas and unforeseen disclosures.\nIt occurred to him that, if these disclosures were literally true,\nhe might bodily visit all those infinitely distant ages and parts of\nthe universe which he had hitherto known only in dreams, could he but\ncommand the magic to change the angle of his consciousness-plane. And\ndid not the silver key supply that magic? Had it not first changed\nhim from a man in 1928 to a boy in 1883, and then to something quite\noutside time? Oddly, despite his present apparent absence of body, he\nknew that the key was still with him.\n\nWhile the silence still lasted, Randolph Carter radiated forth\nthe thoughts and questions which assailed him. He knew that in\nthis ultimate abyss he was equidistant from every facet of his\narchetype\u00e2\u0080\u0094human or non-human, terrestrial or extra-terrestrial,\ngalactic or trans-galactic; and his curiosity regarding the other\nphases of his being\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially those phases which were farthest from\nan earthly 1928 in time and space, or which had most persistently\nhaunted his dreams throughout life\u00e2\u0080\u0094was at fever heat. He felt that his\narchetypal Entity could at will send him bodily to any of these phases\nof bygone and distant life by changing his consciousness-plane, and\ndespite the marvels he had undergone he burned for the further marvel\nof walking in the flesh through those grotesque and incredible scenes\nwhich visions of the night had fragmentarily brought him.\n\nWithout definite intention he was asking the Presence for access\nto a dim, fantastic world whose five multicolored suns, alien\nconstellations, dizzily black crags, clawed, tapir-snouted denizens,\nbizarre metal towers, unexplained tunnels, and cryptical floating\ncylinders had intruded again and again upon his slumbers. That world,\nhe felt vaguely, was in all the conceivable cosmos the one most freely\nin touch with others; and he longed to explore the vistas whose\nbeginnings he had glimpsed, and to embark through space to those still\nremoter worlds with which the clawed, snouted denizens trafficked.\nThere was no time for fear. As at all crises of his strange life, sheer\ncosmic curiosity triumphed over everything else.\n\nWhen the waves resumed their awesome pulsing, Carter knew that his\nterrible request was granted. The Being was telling him of the nighted\ngulfs through which he would have to pass, of the unknown quintuple\nstar in an unsuspected galaxy around which the alien world revolved,\nand of the burrowing inner horrors against which the clawed, snouted\nrace of that world perpetually fought. It told him, too, of how the\nangle of his personal consciousness-plane, and the angle of his\nconsciousness-plane regarding the space-time elements of the sought-for\nworld, would have to be tilted simultaneously in order to restore to\nthat world the Carter-facet which had dwelt there.\n\nThe Presence warned him to be sure of his symbols if he wished ever to\nreturn from the remote and alien world he had chosen, and he radiated\nback an impatient affirmation; confident that the silver key, which he\nfelt was with him and which he knew had tilted both world and personal\nplanes in throwing him back to 1883, contained those symbols which\nwere meant. And now the Being, grasping his impatience, signified its\nreadiness to accomplish the monstrous precipitation. The waves abruptly\nceased, and there supervened a momentary stillness tense with nameless\nand dreadful expectancy.\n\nThen, without warning, came a whirring and drumming that swelled to a\nterrific thundering. Once again Carter felt himself the focal point of\nan intense concentration of energy which smote and hammered and seared\nunbearably in the now-familiar rhythm of outer space, and which he\ncould not classify as either the blasting heat of a blazing star, or\nthe all-petrifying cold of the ultimate abyss. Bands and rays of color\nutterly foreign to any spectrum of our universe played and wove and\ninterlaced before him, and he was conscious of a frightful velocity of\nmotion. He caught one fleeting glimpse of a figure sitting alone upon\na cloudy throne more hexagonal than otherwise....\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\nAs the Hindoo paused in his story he saw that de Marigny and Phillips\nwere watching him absorbedly. Aspinwall pretended to ignore the\nnarrative and kept his eyes ostentatiously on the papers before him.\nThe alien-rhythmed ticking of the coffin-shaped clock took on a new and\nportentous meaning, while the fumes from the choked, neglected tripods\nwove themselves into fantastic and inexplicable shapes, and formed\ndisturbing combinations with the grotesque figures of the draft-swayed\ntapestries. The old negro who had tended them was gone\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps\nsome growing tension had frightened him out of the house. An almost\napologetic hesitancy hampered the speaker as he resumed in his oddly\nlabored yet idiomatic voice.\n\n\"You have found these things of the abyss hard to believe,\" he said,\n\"but you will find the tangible and material things ahead still\nharder. That is the way of our minds. Marvels are doubly incredible\nwhen brought into three dimensions from the vague regions of possible\ndream. I shall not try to tell you much\u00e2\u0080\u0094that would be another and very\ndifferent story. I will tell only what you absolutely have to know.\"\n\nCarter, after that final vortex of alien and polychromatic rhythm,\nhad found himself in what for a moment he thought was his old\ninsistent dream. He was, as many a night before, walking amidst\nthrongs of clawed, snouted beings through the streets of a labyrinth\nof inexplicably fashioned metal under a blaze of diverse solar color;\nand as he looked down he saw that his body was like those of the\nothers\u00e2\u0080\u0094rugose, partly squamous, and curiously articulated in a fashion\nmainly insect-like yet not without a caricaturish resemblance to the\nhuman outline. The silver key was still in his grasp, though held by a\nnoxious-looking claw.\n\nIn another moment the dream-sense vanished, and he felt rather as\none just awakened from a dream. The ultimate abyss\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Being\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\nentity of absurd, outlandish race called Randolph Carter on a world\nof the future not yet born\u00e2\u0080\u0094some of these things were parts of the\npersistent recurrent dreams of the wizard Zkauba on the planet Yaddith.\nThey were too persistent\u00e2\u0080\u0094they interfered with his duties in weaving\nspells to keep the frightful Dholes in their burrows, and became mixed\nup with his recollections of the myriad real worlds he had visited\nin light-beam envelopes. And now they had become quasi-real as never\nbefore. This heavy, material silver key in his right upper claw, exact\nimage of one he had dreamt about, meant no good. He must rest and\nreflect, and consult the tablets of Nhing for advice on what to do.\nClimbing a metal wall in a lane off the main concourse, he entered his\napartment and approached the rack of tablets.\n\nSeven day-fractions later Zkauba squatted on his prism in awe and half\ndespair, for the truth had opened up a new and conflicting set of\nmemories. Nevermore could he know the peace of being one entity. For\nall time and space he was two: Zkauba the wizard of Yaddith, disgusted\nwith the thought of the repellent earth-mammal Carter that he was to be\nand had been, and Randolph Carter, of Boston on the Earth, shivering\nwith fright at the clawed, snouted thing which he had once been, and\nhad become again.\n\nThe time units spent on Yaddith, croaked the Swami\u00e2\u0080\u0094whose labored voice\nwas beginning to show signs of fatigue\u00e2\u0080\u0094made a tale in themselves\nwhich could not be related in brief compass. There were trips to\nStronti and Mthura and Kath, and other worlds in the twenty-eight\ngalaxies accessible to the light-beam envelopes of the creatures of\nYaddith, and trips back and forth through eons of time with the aid of\nthe silver key and various other symbols known to Yaddith's wizards.\nThere were hideous struggles with the bleached viscous Dholes in the\nprimal tunnels that honeycombed the planet. There were awed sessions\nin libraries amongst the massed lore of ten thousand worlds living\nand dead. There were tense conferences with other minds of Yaddith,\nincluding that of the Arch-Ancient Buo. Zkauba told no one of what\nhad befallen his personality, but when the Randolph Carter facet was\nuppermost he would study furiously every possible means of returning\nto the Earth and to human form, and would desperately practise human\nspeech with the alien throat-organs so ill adapted to it.\n\nThe Carter-facet had soon learned with horror that the silver key\nwas unable to effect his return to human form. It was, as he deduced\ntoo late from things he remembered, things he dreamed, and things he\ninferred from the lore of Yaddith, a product of Hyperborea on Earth;\nwith power over the personal consciousness-angles of human beings\nalone. It could, however, change the planetary angle and send the user\nat will through time in an unchanged body. There had been an added\nspell which gave it limitless powers it otherwise lacked; but this,\ntoo, was a human discovery\u00e2\u0080\u0094peculiar to a spatially unreachable region,\nand not to be duplicated by the wizards of Yaddith. It had been written\non the undecipherable parchment in the hideously carven box with the\nsilver key, and Carter bitterly lamented that he had left it behind.\nThe now inaccessible Being of the abyss had warmed him to be sure of\nhis symbols, and had doubtless thought he lacked nothing.\n\nAs time wore on he strove harder and harder to utilize the monstrous\nlore of Yaddith in finding a way back to the abyss and the omnipotent\nEntity. With his new knowledge he could have done much toward reading\nthe cryptic parchment; but that power, under present conditions, was\nmerely ironic. There were times, however, when the Zkauba-facet was\nuppermost, and when he strove to erase the conflicting Carter-memories\nwhich troubled him.\n\nThus long spaces of time wore on\u00e2\u0080\u0094ages longer than the brain of man\ncould grasp, since the beings of Yaddith die only after prolonged\ncycles. After many hundreds of revolutions the Carter-facet seemed to\ngain on the Zkauba-facet, and would spend vast periods calculating\nthe distance of Yaddith in space and time from the human Earth that\nwas to be. The figures were staggering\u00e2\u0080\u0094eons of light-years beyond\ncounting\u00e2\u0080\u0094but the immemorial lore of Yaddith fitted Carter to grasp\nsuch things. He cultivated the power of dreaming himself momentarily\nEarthward, and learned many things about our planet that he had never\nknown before. But he could not dream the needed formula on the missing\nparchment.\n\nThen at last he conceived a wild plan of escape from Yaddith\u00e2\u0080\u0094which\nbegan when he found a drug that would keep his Zkauba-facet always\ndormant, yet without dissolution of the knowledge and memories of\nZkauba. He thought that his calculations would let him perform a\nvoyage with a light-wave envelope such as no being of Yaddith had\never performed\u00e2\u0080\u0094a bodily voyage through nameless eons and across\nincredible galactic reaches to the solar system and the Earth itself.\nOnce on Earth, though in the body of a clawed, snouted thing, he\nmight be able somehow to find\u00e2\u0080\u0094and finish deciphering\u00e2\u0080\u0094the strangely\nhieroglyphed parchment he had left in the car at Arkham; and with its\naid\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the key's\u00e2\u0080\u0094resume his normal terrestrial semblance.\n\nHe was not blind to the perils of the attempt. He knew that when he\nhad brought the planet-angle to the right eon (a thing impossible\nto do while hurtling through space), Yaddith would be a dead world\ndominated by triumphant Dholes, and that his escape in the light-wave\nenvelope would be a matter of grave doubt. Likewise was he aware of\nhow he must achieve suspended animation, in the manner of an adept, to\nendure the eon-long flight through fathomless abysses. He knew, too,\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0094assuming his voyage succeeded\u00e2\u0080\u0094he must immunize himself to the\nbacterial and other earthly conditions hostile to a body from Yaddith.\nFurthermore, he must provide a way of feigning human shape on Earth\nuntil he might recover and decipher the parchment and resume that shape\nin truth. Otherwise he would probably be discovered and destroyed by\nthe people in horror as a thing that should not be. And there must be\nsome gold\u00e2\u0080\u0094luckily obtainable on Yaddith\u00e2\u0080\u0094to tide him over that period\nof quest.\n\nSlowly Carter's plans went forward. He provided a light-wave\nenvelope of abnormal toughness, able to stand both the prodigious\ntime-transition and the unexampled flight through space. He tested all\nhis calculations, and sent forth his Earthward dreams again and again,\nbringing them as close as possible to 1928. He practised suspended\nanimation with marvelous success. He discovered just the bacterial\nagent he needed, and worked out the varying gravity-stress to which\nhe must become used. He artfully fashioned a waxen mask and loose\ncostume enabling him to pass among men as a human being of a sort,\nand devised a doubly potent spell with which to hold back the Dholes\nat the moment of his starting from the dead, black Yaddith of the\ninconceivable future. He took care, too, to assemble a large supply of\nthe drugs\u00e2\u0080\u0094unobtainable on Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0094which would keep his Zkauba-facet\nin abeyance till he might shed the Yaddith body, nor did he neglect a\nsmall store of gold for earthly use.\n\nThe starting-day was a time of doubt and apprehension. Carter climbed\nup to his envelope-platform, on the pretext of sailing for the triple\nstar Nython, and crawled into the sheath of shining metal. He had just\nroom to perform the ritual of the silver key, and as he did so he\nslowly started the levitation of his envelope. There was an appalling\nseething and darkening of the day, and a hideous racking of pain. The\ncosmos seemed to reel irresponsibly, and the other constellations\ndanced in a black sky.\n\n\"Below him the ground was festering with gigantic Dholes.\"\n\nAll at once Carter felt a new equilibrium. The cold of interstellar\ngulfs gnawed at the outside of his envelope, and he could see that he\nfloated free in space\u00e2\u0080\u0094the metal building from which he had started\nhaving decayed years before. Below him the ground was festering with\ngigantic Dholes; and even as he looked, one reared up several hundred\nfeet and levelled a bleached, viscous end at him. But his spells were\neffective, and in another moment he was falling away from Yaddith,\nunharmed.\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\nIn that bizarre room in New Orleans, from which the old black servant\nhad instinctively fled, the odd voice of Swami Chandraputra grew\nhoarser still.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he continued, \"I will not ask you to believe these things\nuntil I have shown you special proof. Accept it, then, as a myth, when\nI tell you of the thousands of light-years\u00e2\u0080\u0094thousands of years of\ntime, and uncounted billions of miles that Randolph Carter hurtled\nthrough space as a nameless, alien entity in a thin envelope of\nelectron-activated metal. He timed his period of suspended animation\nwith utmost care, planning to have it end only a few years before the\ntime of landing on the Earth in or near 1928.\n\n\"He will never forget that awakening. Remember, gentlemen, that\nbefore that eon-long sleep he had lived consciously for thousands of\nterrestrial years amidst the alien and horrible wonders of Yaddith .\nThere was a hideous gnawing of cold, a cessation of menacing dreams,\nand a glance through the eye-plates of the envelope. Stars, clusters,\nnebul\u00c3\u00a6, on every hand\u00e2\u0080\u0094 and at last their outlines bore some kinship\nto the constellations of Earth that he knew .\n\n\"Some day his descent into the solar system may be told. He saw Kynarth\nand Yuggoth on the rim, passed close to Neptune and glimpsed the\nhellish white fungi that spot it, learned an untellable secret from\nthe close-glimpsed mists of Jupiter, and saw the horror on one of the\nsatellites, and gazed at the cyclopean ruins that sprawl over Mars'\nruddy disk. When the Earth drew near he saw it as a thin crescent which\nswelled alarmingly in size. He slackened speed, though his sensations\nof homecoming made him wish to lose not a moment. I will not try to\ntell you of those sensations as I learned them from Carter.\n\n\"Well, toward the last Carter hovered about in the Earth's upper air\nwaiting till daylight came over the Western Hemisphere. He wanted to\nland where he had left\u00e2\u0080\u0094near the Snake Den in the hills behind Arkham.\nIf any of you have been away from home long\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I know one of you\nhas\u00e2\u0080\u0094I leave it to you how the sight of New England's rolling hills\nand great elms and gnarled orchards and ancient stone walls must have\naffected him.\n\n\"He came down at dawn in the lower meadow of the old Carter place, and\nwas thankful for the silence and solitude. It was autumn, as when he\nhad left, and the smell of the hills was balm to his soul. He managed\nto drag the metal envelope up the slope of the timber-lot into the\nSnake Den, though it would not go through the weed-choked fissure to\nthe inner cave. It was there also that he covered his alien body with\nthe human clothing and waxen mask which would be necessary. He kept the\nenvelope here for over a year, till certain circumstances made a new\nhiding-place necessary.\n\n\"He walked to Arkham\u00e2\u0080\u0094incidentally practising the management of his\nbody in human posture and against terrestrial gravity\u00e2\u0080\u0094and got his gold\nchanged to money at a bank. He also made some inquiries\u00e2\u0080\u0094posing as a\nforeigner ignorant of much English\u00e2\u0080\u0094and found that the year was 1930,\nonly two years after the goal he had aimed at.\n\n\"Of course, his position was horrible. Unable to assert his identity,\nforced to live on guard every moment, with certain difficulties\nregarding food, and with a need to conserve the alien drug which kept\nhis Zkauba-facet dormant, he felt that he must act as quickly as\npossible. Going to Boston and taking a room in the decaying West End,\nwhere he could live cheaply and inconspicuously, he at once established\ninquiries concerning Randolph Carter's estate and effects. It was then\nthat he learned how anxious Mr. Aspinwall, here, was to have the estate\ndivided, and how valiantly Mr. de Marigny and Mr. Phillips strove to\nkeep it intact.\"\n\nThe Hindoo bowed, though no expression crossed his dark, tranquil, and\nthickly bearded face.\n\n\"Indirectly,\" he continued, \"Carter secured a good copy of the missing\nparchment and began working on its deciphering. I am glad to say that\nI was able to help in all this\u00e2\u0080\u0094for he appealed to me quite early, and\nthrough me came in touch with other mystics throughout the world. I\nwent to live with him in Boston\u00e2\u0080\u0094a wretched place in Chambers Street.\nAs for the parchment\u00e2\u0080\u0094I am pleased to help Mr. de Marigny in his\nperplexity. To him let me say that the language of those hieroglyphics\nis not Naacal, but R'lyehian, which was brought to Earth by the spawn\nof Cthulhu countless ages ago. It is, of course, a translation\u00e2\u0080\u0094there\nwas an Hyperborean original millions of years earlier in the primal\ntongue of Tsath-yo.\n\n\"There was more to decipher than Carter had looked for, but at no\ntime did he give up hope. Early this year he made great strides\nthrough a book he imported from Nepal, and there is no question but\nthat he will win before long. Unfortunately, however, one handicap\nhas developed\u00e2\u0080\u0094the exhaustion of the alien drug which keeps the\nZkauba-facet dormant. This is not, however, as great a calamity as was\nfeared. Carter's personality is gaining in the body, and when Zkauba\ncomes uppermost\u00e2\u0080\u0094for shorter and shorter periods, and now only when\nevoked by some unusual excitement\u00e2\u0080\u0094he is generally too dazed to undo\nany of Carter's work. He can not find the metal envelope that would\ntake him back to Yaddith, for although he almost did, once, Carter hid\nit anew at a time when the Zkauba-facet was wholly latent. All the harm\nhe has done is to frighten a few people and create certain nightmare\nrumors among the Poles and Lithuanians of Boston's West End. So far, he\nhas never injured the careful disguise prepared by the Carter-facet,\nthough he sometimes throws it off so that parts have to be replaced. I\nhave seen what lies beneath\u00e2\u0080\u0094and it is not good to see.\n\n\"A month ago Carter saw the advertisement of this meeting, and knew\nthat he must act quickly to save his estate. He could not wait to\ndecipher the parchment and resume his human form. Consequently he\ndeputed me to act for him.\n\n\"Gentlemen, I say to you that Randolph Carter is not dead; that he is\ntemporarily in an anomalous condition, but that within two or three\nmonths at the outside he will be able to appear in proper form and\ndemand the custody of his estate. I am prepared to offer proof if\nnecessary. Therefore I beg that you will adjourn this meeting for an\nindefinite period.\"\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\nDe Marigny and Phillips stared at the Hindoo as if hypnotized, while\nAspinwall emitted a series of snorts and bellows. The old attorney's\ndisgust had by now surged into open rage, and he pounded the table with\nan apoplectically veined fist. When he spoke, it was in a kind of bark.\n\n\"How long is this foolery to be borne? I've listened an hour to this\nmadman\u00e2\u0080\u0094this faker\u00e2\u0080\u0094and now he has the damned effrontery to say\nRandolph Carter is alive\u00e2\u0080\u0094to ask us to postpone the settlement for no\ngood reason! Why don't you throw the scoundrel out, de Marigny? Do you\nmean to make us all the butts of a charlatan or idiot?\"\n\nDe Marigny quietly raised his hand and spoke softly.\n\n\"Let us think slowly and clearly. This has been a very singular\ntale, and there are things in it which I, as a mystic not altogether\nignorant, recognize as far from impossible. Furthermore\u00e2\u0080\u0094since 1930 I\nhave received letters from the Swami which tally with his account.\"\n\nAs he paused, old Mr. Phillips ventured a word.\n\n\"Swami Chandraputra spoke of proofs. I, too, recognize much that\nis significant in this story, and I have myself had many oddly\ncorroborative letters from the Swami during the last two years; but\nsome of these statements are very extreme. Is there not something\ntangible which can be shown?\"\n\nAt last the impassive-faced Swami replied, slowly and hoarsely, and\ndrawing an object from the pocket of his loose coat as he spoke.\n\n\"While none of you here has ever seen the silver key itself, Messrs.\nde Marigny and Phillips have seen photographs of it. Does this look\nfamiliar to you? \"\n\nHe fumblingly laid on the table, with his large, white-mittened hand,\na heavy key of tarnished silver\u00e2\u0080\u0094nearly five inches long, of unknown\nand utterly exotic workmanship, and covered from end to end with\nhieroglyphs of the most bizarre description. De Marigny and Phillips\ngasped.\n\n\"That's it!\" cried de Marigny. \"The camera doesn't lie. I couldn't be\nmistaken!\"\n\nBut Aspinwall had already launched a reply.\n\n\"Fools! What does it prove? If that's really the key that belonged to\nmy cousin, it's up to this foreigner\u00e2\u0080\u0094this damned nigger\u00e2\u0080\u0094to explain\nhow he got it! Randolph Carter vanished with the key four years ago.\nHow do we know he wasn't robbed and murdered? He was half crazy\nhimself, and in touch with still crazier people.\n\n\"Look here, you nigger\u00e2\u0080\u0094where did you get that key? Did you kill\nRandolph Carter?\"\n\nThe Swami's features, abnormally placid, did not change; but the\nremote, irisless black eyes behind them blazed dangerously. He spoke\nwith great difficulty.\n\n\"Please control yourself, Mr. Aspinwall. There is another form of\nproof that I could give, but its effect upon everybody would not be\npleasant. Let us be reasonable. Here are some papers obviously written\nsince 1930, and in the unmistakable style of Randolph Carter.\"\n\nHe clumsily drew a long envelope from inside his loose coat and handed\nit to the sputtering attorney as de Marigny and Phillips watched with\nchaotic thoughts and a dawning feeling of supernal wonder.\n\n\"Of course the handwriting is almost illegible\u00e2\u0080\u0094but remember that\nRandolph Carter now has no hands well adapted to forming human script.\"\n\nAspinwall looked through the papers hurriedly, and was visibly\nperplexed, but he did not change his demeanor. The room was tense\nwith excitement and nameless dread, and the alien rhythm of the\ncoffin-shaped clock had an utterly diabolic sound to de Marigny and\nPhillips, though the lawyer seemed affected not at all.\n\nAspinwall spoke again. \"These look like clever forgeries. If they\naren't, they may mean that Randolph Carter has been brought under the\ncontrol of people with no good purpose. There's only one thing to\ndo\u00e2\u0080\u0094have this faker arrested. De Marigny, will you telephone for the\npolice?\"\n\n\"Let us wait,\" answered their host. \"I do not think this case calls for\nthe police. I have a certain idea. Mr. Aspinwall, this gentleman is a\nmystic of real attainments. He says he is in the confidence of Randolph\nCarter. Will it satisfy you if he can answer certain questions which\ncould be answered only by one in such confidence? I know Carter, and\ncan ask such questions. Let me get a book which I think will make a\ngood test.\"\n\nHe turned toward the door to the library, Phillips dazedly following\nin a kind of automatic way. Aspinwall remained where he was, studying\nclosely the Hindoo who confronted him with abnormally impassive face.\nSuddenly, as Chandraputra clumsily restored the silver key to his\npocket, the lawyer emitted a guttural shout.\n\n\"Hey, by Heaven! I've got it! This rascal is in disguise. I don't\nbelieve he's an East Indian at all. That face\u00e2\u0080\u0094it isn't a face, but\na mask ! I guess his story put that into my head, but it's true. It\nnever moves, and that turban and beard hide the edges. This fellow's\na common crook! He isn't even a foreigner\u00e2\u0080\u0094I've been watching his\nlanguage. He's a Yankee of some sort. And look at those mittens\u00e2\u0080\u0094he\nknows his fingerprints could be spotted. Damn you, I'll pull that thing\noff\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\n\"Stop!\" The hoarse, oddly alien voice of the Swami held a tone beyond\nall mere earthly fright. \"I told you there was another form of proof\nwhich I could give if necessary , and I warned you not to provoke me to\nit. This red-faced old meddler is right\u00e2\u0080\u0094I'm not really an East Indian. This face is a mask, and what it covers is not human. You others have\nguessed\u00e2\u0080\u0094I felt that minutes ago. It wouldn't be pleasant if I took\nthat mask off\u00e2\u0080\u0094let it alone, Ernest. I may as well tell you that I am\nRandolph Carter .\"\n\nNo one moved. Aspinwall snorted and made vague motions. De Marigny\nand Phillips, across the room, watched the workings of the red face\nand studied the back of the turbaned figure that confronted him. The\nclock's abnormal ticking was hideous, and the tripod fumes and swaying\narras danced a dance of death. The half-choking lawyer broke the\nsilence.\n\n\"No you don't, you crook\u00e2\u0080\u0094you can't scare me! You've reasons of your\nown for not wanting that mask off. Maybe we'd know who you are. Off\nwith it\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\nAs he reached forward, the Swami seized his hand with one of his own\nclumsily mittened members, evoking a curious cry of mixed pain and\nsurprize. De Marigny started toward the two, but paused confused as\nthe pseudo-Hindoo's shout of protest changed to a wholly inexplicable\nrattling and buzzing sound. Aspinwall's red face was furious, and with\nhis free hand he made another lunge at his opponent's bushy beard.\nThis time he succeeded in getting a hold, and at his frantic tug the\nwhole waxen visage came loose from the turban and clung to the lawyer's\napoplectic fist.\n\nAs it did so, Aspinwall uttered a frightful gurgling cry, and Phillips\nand de Marigny saw his face convulsed with a wilder, deeper and more\nhideous epilepsy of stark panic than ever they had seen on human\ncountenance before. The pseudo-Swami had meanwhile released his other\nhand and was standing as if dazed, making buzzing noises of a most\nabnormal quality. Then the turbaned figure slumped oddly into a posture\nscarcely human, and began a curious, fascinated sort of shuffle toward\nthe coffin-shaped clock that ticked out its cosmic and abnormal rhythm.\nHis now uncovered face was turned away, and de Marigny and Phillips\ncould not see what the lawyer's act had disclosed. Then their attention\nwas turned to Aspinwall, who was sinking ponderously to the floor. The\nspell was broken\u00e2\u0080\u0094but when they reached the old man he was dead.\n\nTurning quickly to the shuffling Swami's receding back, de Marigny saw\none of the great white mittens drop listlessly off a dangling arm. The\nfumes of the olibanum were thick, and all that could be glimpsed of the\nrevealed hand was something long and black. Before the Creole could\nreach the retreating figure, old Mr. Phillips laid a restraining hand\non his shoulder.\n\n\"Don't!\" he whispered. \"We don't know what we're up against. That other\nfacet, you know\u00e2\u0080\u0094Zkauba, the wizard of Yaddith....\"\n\nThe turbaned figure had now reached the abnormal clock, and the\nwatchers saw through the dense fumes a blurred black claw fumbling with\nthe tall, hieroglyphed door. The fumbling made a queer, clicking sound.\nThen the figure entered the coffin-shaped case and pulled the door shut\nafter it.\n\nDe Marigny could no longer be restrained, but when he reached and\nopened the clock it was empty. The abnormal ticking went on, beating\nout the dark, cosmic rhythm which underlies all mystical gate-openings.\nOn the floor the great white mitten, and the dead man with a bearded\nmask clutched in his hand, had nothing further to reveal.\n\nA year passed, and nothing has been heard of Randolph Carter. His\nestate is still unsettled. The Boston address from which one \"Swami\nChandraputra\" sent inquiries to various mystics in 1930-31-32 was\nindeed tenanted by a strange Hindoo, but he left shortly before the\ndate of the New Orleans conference and has never been seen since. He\nwas said to be dark, expressionless, and bearded, and his landlord\nthinks the swarthy mask\u00e2\u0080\u0094which was duly exhibited\u00e2\u0080\u0094looks very much\nlike him. He was never, however, suspected of any connection with the\nnightmare apparitions whispered of by local Slavs. The hills behind\nArkham were searched for the \"metal envelope,\" but nothing of the sort\nwas ever found. However, a clerk in Arkham's First National Bank does\nrecall a queer turbaned man who cashed an odd bit of gold bullion in\nOctober, 1930.\n\nDe Marigny and Phillips scarcely know what to make of the business.\nAfter all, what was proved? There was a story. There was a key which\nmight have been forged from one of the pictures Carter had freely\ndistributed in 1928. There were papers\u00e2\u0080\u0094all indecisive. There was a\nmasked stranger, but who now living saw behind the mask? Amidst the\nstrain and the olibanum fumes that act of vanishing in the clock might\neasily have been a dual hallucination. Hindoos know much of hypnotism.\nReason proclaims the \"Swami\" a criminal with designs on Randolph\nCarter's estate. But the autopsy said that Aspinwall had died of shock.\nWas it rage alone which caused it? And some things in that story....\n\nIn a vast room hung with strangely figured arras and filled with\nolibanum fumes, Etienne-Laurent de Marigny often sits listening\nwith vague sensations to the abnormal rhythm of that hieroglyphed,\ncoffin-shaped clock.",
