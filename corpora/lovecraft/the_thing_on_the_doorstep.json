    "body": "The Thing on the Door-Step\n\nBy H. P. LOVECRAFT\n\nA powerful tale by one of the supreme masters of weird fiction\u00e2\u0080\u0094a tale in which the horror creeps and grows, to spring at last upon the reader in all its hideous totality.\n\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Weird Tales January 1937. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\nIt is true that I have sent six bullets through the head of my best\nfriend, and yet I hope to show by this statement that I am not his\nmurderer. At first I shall be called a madman\u00e2\u0080\u0094madder than the man I\nshot in his cell at the Arkham Sanitarium. Later some of my readers\nwill weigh each statement, correlate it with the known facts, and ask\nthemselves how I could have believed otherwise than as I did after\nfacing the evidence of that horror\u00e2\u0080\u0094that thing on the door-step.\n\nUntil then I also saw nothing but madness in the wild tales I have\nacted on. Even now I ask myself whether I was misled\u00e2\u0080\u0094or whether I\nam not mad after all. I do not know\u00e2\u0080\u0094but others have strange things\nto tell of Edward and Asenath Derby, and even the stolid police are\nat their wits' ends to account for that last terrible visit. They\nhave tried weakly to concoct a theory of a ghastly jest or warning by\ndischarged servants; yet they know in their hearts that the truth is\nsomething infinitely more terrible and incredible.\n\nSo I say that I have not murdered Edward Derby. Rather have I avenged\nhim, and in so doing purged the earth of a horror whose survival might\nhave loosed untold terrors on all mankind. There are black zones of\nshadow close to our daily paths, and now and then some evil soul breaks\na passage through. When that happens, the man who knows must strike\nbefore reckoning the consequences.\n\nI have known Edward Pickman Derby all his life. Eight years my junior,\nhe was so precocious that we had much in common from the time he was\neight and I sixteen. He was the most phenomenal child scholar I have\never known, and at seven was writing verse of a somber, fantastic,\nalmost morbid cast which astonished the tutors surrounding him. Perhaps\nhis private education and coddled seclusion had something to do with\nhis premature flowering. An only child, he had organic weaknesses\nwhich startled his doting parents and caused them to keep him closely\nchained to their side. He was never allowed out without his nurse, and\nseldom had a chance to play unconstrainedly with other children. All\nthis doubtless fostered a strange secretive inner life in the boy, with\nimagination as his one avenue of freedom.\n\nAt any rate, his juvenile learning was prodigious and bizarre; and his\nfacile writings such as to captivate me despite my greater age. About\nthat time I had leanings toward art of a somewhat grotesque cast, and\nI found in this younger child a rare kindred spirit. What lay behind\nour joint love of shadows and marvels was, no doubt, the ancient,\nmoldering, and subtly fearsome town in which we lived\u00e2\u0080\u0094witch-cursed,\nlegend-haunted Arkham, whose huddled, sagging gambrel roofs and\ncrumbling Georgian balustrades brood out the centuries beside the\ndarkly muttering Miskatonic.\n\nAs time went by I turned to architecture and gave up my design of\nillustrating a book of Edward's demoniac poems, yet our comradeship\nsuffered no lessening. Young Derby's odd genius developed remarkably,\nand in his eighteenth year his collected nightmare-lyrics made a real\nsensation when issued under the title Azathoth and Other Horrors . He\nwas a close correspondent of the notorious Baudelairean poet Justin\nGeoffrey, who wrote The People of the Monolith and died screaming in\na madhouse in 1926 after a visit to a sinister, ill-regarded village in\nHungary.\n\nIn self-reliance and practical affairs, however, Derby was greatly\nretarded because of his coddled existence. His health had improved,\nbut his habits of childish dependence were fostered by over-careful\nparents, so that he never traveled alone, made independent decisions,\nor assumed responsibilities. It was early seen that he would not be\nequal to a struggle in the business or professional arena, but the\nfamily fortune was so ample that this formed no tragedy. As he grew\nto years of manhood he retained a deceptive aspect of boyishness.\nBlond and blue-eyed, he had the fresh complexion of a child, and his\nattempts to raise a mustache were discernible only with difficulty. His\nvoice was soft and light, and his unexercised life gave him a juvenile\nchubbiness rather than the paunchiness of premature middle age. He was\nof good height, and his handsome face would have made him a notable\ngallant had not his shyness held him to seclusion and bookishness.\n\nDerby's parents took him abroad every summer, and he was quick to seize\non the surface aspects of European thought and expression. His Poe-like\ntalents turned more and more toward the decadent, and other artistic\nsensitivenesses and yearnings were half aroused in him.\n\nWe had great discussions in those days. I had been through Harvard, had\nstudied in a Boston architect's office, had married, and had finally\nreturned to Arkham to practise my profession\u00e2\u0080\u0094settling in the family\nhomestead in Salton-stall Street, since my father had moved to Florida\nfor his health. Edward used to call almost every evening, till I came\nto regard him as one of the household. He had a characteristic way\nof ringing the door-bell or sounding the knocker that grew to be a\nveritable code signal, so that after dinner I always listened for the\nfamiliar three brisk strokes followed by two more after a pause. Less\nfrequently I would visit at his house and note with envy the obscure\nvolumes in his constantly growing library.\n\nDerby went through Miskatonic University in Arkham, since his parents\nwould not let him board away from them. He entered at sixteen and\ncompleted his course in three years, majoring in English and French\nliterature and receiving high marks in everything but mathematics\nand the sciences. He mingled very little with the other students,\nthough looking enviously at the \"daring\" or \"Bohemian\" set\u00e2\u0080\u0094whose\nsuperficially \"smart\" language and meaninglessly ironic pose he aped,\nand whose dubious conduct he wished he dared adopt.\n\nWhat he did do was to become an almost fanatical devotee of\nsubterranean magical lore, for which Miskatonic's library was and is\nfamous. Always a dweller on the surface of fantasy and strangeness, he\nnow delved deep into the actual runes and riddles left by a fabulous\npast for the guidance or puzzlement of posterity. He read things like\nthe frightful Book of Eibon , the Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von\nJunzt, and the forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred,\nthough he did not tell his parents he had seen them. Edward was twenty\nwhen my son and only child was born, and seemed pleased when I named\nthe newcomer Edward Derby Upton, after him.\n\nBy the time he was twenty-five Edward Derby was a prodigiously learned\nman and a fairly well-known poet and fantaisiste , though his lack\nof contacts and responsibilities had slowed down his literary growth\nby making his products derivative and over-bookish. I was perhaps his\nclosest friend\u00e2\u0080\u0094finding him an inexhaustible mine of vital theoretical\ntopics, while he relied on me for advice in whatever matters he did not\nwish to refer to his parents. He remained single\u00e2\u0080\u0094more through shyness,\ninertia and parental protectiveness than through inclination\u00e2\u0080\u0094and moved\nin society only to the slightest and most perfunctory extent. When the\nwar came both health and ingrained timidity kept him at home. I went to\nPlattsburg for a commission, but never got overseas.\n\nSo the years wore on. Edward's mother died when he was thirty-four, and\nfor months he was incapacitated by some odd psychological malady. His\nfather took him to Europe, however, and he managed to pull out of his\ntrouble without visible effects. Afterward he seemed to feel a sort\nof grotesque exhilaration, as if of partial escape from some unseen\nbondage. He began to mingle in the more \"advanced\" college set despite\nhis middle age, and was present at some extremely wild doings\u00e2\u0080\u0094on one\noccasion paying heavy blackmail (which he borrowed of me) to keep his\npresence at a certain affair from his father's notice. Some of the\nwhispered rumors about the wild Miskatonic set were extremely singular.\nThere was even talk of black magic and of happenings utterly beyond\ncredibility.\n\n2\n\nEdward was thirty-eight when he met Asenath Waite. She was, I judge,\nabout twenty-three at the time; and was taking a special course in\nmedi\u00c3\u00a6val meta-physics at Miskatonic. The daughter of a friend of mine\nhad met her before\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the Hall School at Kingsport\u00e2\u0080\u0094and had been\ninclined to shun her because of her odd reputation. She was dark,\nsmallish, and very good-looking except for over-protuberant eyes; but\nsomething in her expression alienated extremely sensitive people. It\nwas, however, largely her origin and conversation which caused average\nfolk to avoid her. She was one of the Innsmouth Waites, and dark\nlegends have clustered for generations about crumbling, half-deserted\nInnsmouth and its people. There are tales of horrible bargains about\nthe year 1850, and of a strange element \"not quite human\" in the\nancient families of the run-down fishing-port\u00e2\u0080\u0094tales such as only\nold-time Yankees can devise and repeat with proper awesomeness.\n\nAsenath's case was aggravated by the fact that she was Ephraim Waite's\ndaughter\u00e2\u0080\u0094the child of his old age by an unknown wife who always went\nveiled. Ephraim lived in a half-decayed mansion in Washington Street,\nInnsmouth, and those who had seen the place (Arkham folk avoid going\nto Innsmouth whenever they can) declared that the attic windows were\nalways boarded, and that strange sounds sometimes floated from within\nas evening drew on. The old man was known to have been a prodigious\nmagical student in his day, and legend averred that he could raise\nor quell storms at sea according to his whim. I had seen him once or\ntwice in my youth as he came to Arkham to consult forbidden tomes at\nthe college library, and had hated his wolfish, saturnine face with\nits tangle of iron-gray beard. He had died insane\u00e2\u0080\u0094under rather queer\ncircumstances\u00e2\u0080\u0094just before his daughter (by his will made a nominal\nward of the principal) entered the Hall School, but she had been his\nmorbidly avid pupil and looked fiendishly like him at times.\n\nThe friend whose daughter had gone to school with Asenath Waite\nrepeated many curious things when the news of Edward's acquaintance\nwith her began to spread about. Asenath, it seemed, had posed as a\nkind of magician at school; and had really seemed able to accomplish\nsome highly baffling marvels. She professed to be able to raise\nthunderstorms, though her seeming success was generally laid to some\nuncanny knack at prediction. All animals markedly disliked her, and she\ncould make any dog howl by certain motions of her right hand. There\nwere times when she displayed snatches of knowledge and language very\nsingular\u00e2\u0080\u0094and very shocking\u00e2\u0080\u0094for a young girl; when she would frighten\nher schoolmates with leers and winks of an inexplicable kind, and would\nseem to extract an obscene and zestful irony from her present situation.\n\nMost unusual, though, were the well-attested cases of her influence\nover other persons. She was, beyond question, a genuine hypnotist. By\ngazing peculiarly at a fellow-student she would often give the latter\na distinct feeling of exchanged personality \u00e2\u0080\u0094as if the subject were\nplaced momentarily in the magician's body and able to stare half across\nthe room at her real body, whose eyes blazed and protruded with an\nalien expression. Asenath often made wild claims about the nature of\nconsciousness and about its independence of the physical frame\u00e2\u0080\u0094or\nat least from the life-processes of the physical frame. Her crowning\nrage, however, was that she was not a man; since she believed a male\nbrain had certain unique and far-reaching cosmic powers. Given a man's\nbrain, she declared, she could not only equal but surpass her father in\nmastery of unknown forces.\n\nEdward met Asenath at a gathering of \"intelligentsia\" held in one of\nthe students' rooms, and could talk of nothing else when he came to see\nme the next day. He had found her full of the interests and erudition\nwhich engrossed him most, and was in addition wildly taken with her\nappearance. I had never seen the young woman, and recalled casual\nreferences only faintly, but I knew who she was. It seemed rather\nregrettable that Derby should become so upheaved about her; but I said\nnothing to discourage him, since infatuation thrives on opposition. He\nwas not, he said, mentioning her to his father.\n\nIn the next few weeks I heard of very little but Asenath from young\nDerby. Others now remarked Edward's autumnal gallantry, though they\nagreed that he did not look even nearly his actual age, or seem at\nall inappropriate as an escort for his bizarre divinity. He was only\na trifle paunchy despite his indolence and self-indulgence, and his\nface was absolutely without lines. Asenath, on the other hand, had the\npremature crow's-feet which come from the exercise of an intense will.\n\nAbout this time Edward brought the girl to call on me, and I at\nonce saw that his interest was by no means one-sided. She eyed him\ncontinually with an almost predatory air, and I perceived that their\nintimacy was beyond untangling. Soon afterward I had a visit from old\nMr. Derby, whom I had always admired and respected. He had heard the\ntales of his son's new friendship and had wormed the whole truth out\nof \"the boy\". Edward meant to marry Asenath, and had even been looking\nat houses in the suburbs. Knowing my usually great influence with his\nson, the father wondered if I could help to break the ill-advised\naffair off; but I regretfully expressed my doubts. This time it was not\na question of Edward's weak will but of the woman's strong will. The\nperennial child had transferred his dependence from the parental image\nto a new and stronger image, and nothing could be done about it.\n\nThe wedding was performed a month later by a justice of the peace\naccording to the bride's request. Mr. Derby, at my advice, offered\nno opposition, and he, my wife, my son and I attended the brief\nceremony\u00e2\u0080\u0094the other guests being wild young people from the college.\nAsenath had bought the old Crowninshield place in the country at the\nend of High Street, and they proposed to settle there after a short\ntrip to Innsmouth, whence three servants and some books and household\ngoods were to be brought. It was probably not so much consideration for\nEdward and his father as a personal wish to be near the college, its\nlibrary, and its crowd of \"sophisticates\", that made Asenath settle in\nArkham instead of returning permanently home.\n\nWhen Edward called on me after the honeymoon I thought he looked\nslightly changed. Asenath had made him get rid of the undeveloped\nmustache, but there was more than that. He looked soberer and more\nthoughtful, his habitual pout of childish rebelliousness being\nexchanged for a look almost of genuine sadness. I was puzzled to decide\nwhether I liked or disliked the change. Certainly he seemed for the\nmoment more normally adult than ever before. Perhaps the marriage\nwas a good thing\u00e2\u0080\u0094might not the change of dependence form a start\ntoward actual neutralization , leading ultimately to responsible\nindependence? He came alone, for Asenath was very busy. She had brought\na vast store of books and apparatus from Innsmouth (Derby shuddered\nas he spoke the name), and was finishing the restoration of the\nCrowninshield house and grounds.\n\nHer home in\u00e2\u0080\u0094that town\u00e2\u0080\u0094was a rather disgusting place, but certain\nobjects in it had taught him some surprizing things. He was progressing\nfast in esoteric lore now that he had Asenath's guidance. Some of the\nexperiments she proposed were very daring and radical\u00e2\u0080\u0094he did not\nfeel at liberty to describe them\u00e2\u0080\u0094but he had confidence in her powers\nand intentions. The three servants were very queer\u00e2\u0080\u0094an incredibly\naged couple who had been with old Ephraim and referred occasionally\nto him and to Asenath's dead mother in a cryptic way, and a swarthy\nyoung wench who had marked anomalies of feature and seemed to exude a\nperpetual odor of fish.\n\n3\n\nFor the next two years I saw less and less of Derby. A fortnight would\nsometimes slip by without the familiar three-and-two strokes at the\nfront door; and when he did call\u00e2\u0080\u0094or when, as happened with increasing\ninfrequency, I called on him\u00e2\u0080\u0094he was very little disposed to converse\non vital topics. He had become secretive about those occult studies\nwhich he used to describe and discuss so minutely, and preferred not\nto talk of his wife. She had aged tremendously since her marriage,\ntill now\u00e2\u0080\u0094oddly enough\u00e2\u0080\u0094she seemed the elder of the two. Her face held\nthe most concentratedly determined expression I had ever seen, and her\nwhole aspect seemed to gain a vague, unplaceable repulsiveness. My wife\nand son noticed it as much as I, and we all ceased gradually to call\non her\u00e2\u0080\u0094for which, Edward admitted in one of his boyishly tactless\nmoments, she was unmitigatedly grateful. Occasionally the Derbys would\ngo on long trips\u00e2\u0080\u0094ostensibly to Europe, though Edward sometimes hinted\nat obscurer destinations.\n\nIt was after the first year that people began talking about the change\nin Edward Derby. It was very casual talk, for the change was purely\npsychological; but it brought up some interesting points. Now and then,\nit seemed, Edward was observed to wear an expression and to do things\nwholly incompatible with his usual flabby nature. For example\u00e2\u0080\u0094although\nin the old days he could not drive a car, he was now seen occasionally\nto dash into or out of the old Crowninshield driveway with Asenath's\npowerful Packard, handling it like a master, and meeting traffic\nentanglements with a skill and determination utterly alien to his\naccustomed nature. In such cases he seemed always to be just back from\nsome trip or just starting on one\u00e2\u0080\u0094what sort of trip, no one could\nguess, although he mostly favored the Innsmouth road.\n\nOddly, the metamorphosis did not seem altogether pleasing. People said\nhe looked too much like his wife, or like old Ephraim Waite himself,\nin these moments\u00e2\u0080\u0094or perhaps these moments seemed unnatural because\nthey were so rare. Sometimes, hours after starting out in this way, he\nwould return listlessly sprawled on the rear seat of the car while an\nobviously hired chauffeur or mechanic drove. Also, his preponderant\naspect on the streets or during his decreasing round of social contacts\n(including, I may say, his calls on me) was the old-time indecisive\none\u00e2\u0080\u0094its irresponsible childishness even more marked than in the past.\nWhile Asenath's face aged, Edward's\u00e2\u0080\u0094aside from those exceptional\noccasions\u00e2\u0080\u0094actually relaxed into a kind of exaggerated immaturity, save\nwhen a trace of the new sadness or understanding would flash across it.\nIt was really very puzzling. Meanwhile the Derbys almost dropped out of\nthe gay college circle\u00e2\u0080\u0094not through their own disgust, we heard, but\nbecause something about their present studies shocked even the most\ncallous of the other decadents.\n\nIt was in the third year of the marriage that Edward began to hint\nopenly to me of a certain fear and dissatisfaction. He would let fall\nremarks about things \"going too far\", and would talk darkly about the\nneed of \"gaining his identity\". At first I ignored such references, but\nin time I began to question him guardedly, remembering what my friend's\ndaughter had said about Asenath's hypnotic influence over the other\ngirls at school\u00e2\u0080\u0094the cases where students had thought they were in her\nbody looking across the room at themselves. This questioning seemed to\nmake him at once alarmed and grateful, and once he mumbled something\nabout having a serious talk with me later.\n\nAbout this time old Mr. Derby died, for which I was afterward very\nthankful. Edward was badly upset, though by no means disorganized.\nHe had seen astonishingly little of his parent since his marriage,\nfor Asenath had concentrated in herself all his vital sense of family\nlinkage. Some called him callous in his loss\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially since those\njaunty and confident moods with the car began to increase. He now\nwished to move back into the old family mansion, but Asenath insisted\non staying in the Crowninshield house, to which she had become well\nadjusted.\n\nNot long afterward my wife heard a curious thing from a friend\u00e2\u0080\u0094one\nof the few who had not dropped the Derbys. She had been out to the\nend of High Street to call on the couple, and had seen a car shoot\nbriskly out of the drive with Edward's oddly confident and almost\nsneering face above the wheel. Ringing the bell, she had been told by\nthe repulsive wench that Asenath was also out; but had chanced to look\nup at the house in leaving. There, at one of Edward's library windows,\nshe had glimpsed a hastily withdrawn face\u00e2\u0080\u0094a face whose expression\nof pain, defeat, and wistful hopelessness was poignant beyond\ndescription. It was\u00e2\u0080\u0094incredibly enough in view of its usual domineering\ncast\u00e2\u0080\u0094Asenath's; yet the caller had vowed that in that instant the sad,\nmuddled eyes of poor Edward were gazing out from it.\n\nEdward's calls now grew a trifle more frequent, and his hints\noccasionally became concrete. What he said was not to be believed,\neven in centuried and legend-haunted Arkham; but he threw out his\ndark lore with a sincerity and convincingness which made one fear\nfor his sanity. He talked about terrible meetings in lonely places,\nof cyclopean ruins in the heart of the Maine woods beneath which vast\nstaircases led down to abysses of nighted secrets, of complex angles\nthat led through invisible walls to other regions of space and time,\nand of hideous exchanges of personality that permitted explorations\nin remote and forbidden places, on other worlds, and in different\nspace-time continua.\n\nHe would now and then back up certain crazy hints by exhibiting objects\nwhich utterly nonplussed me\u00e2\u0080\u0094elusively colored and bafflingly textured\nobjects like nothing ever heard of on earth, whose insane curves and\nsurfaces answered no conceivable purpose and followed no conceivable\ngeometry. These things, he said, came \"from outside\"; and his wife knew\nhow to get them. Sometimes\u00e2\u0080\u0094but always in frightened and ambiguous\nwhispers\u00e2\u0080\u0094he would suggest things about old Ephraim Waite, whom he\nhad seen occasionally at the college library in the old days. These\nadumbrations were never specific, but seemed to revolve around some\nespecially horrible doubt as to whether the old wizard were really\ndead\u00e2\u0080\u0094in a spiritual as well as corporeal sense.\n\nAt times Derby would halt abruptly in his revelations, and I wondered\nwhether Asenath could possibly have divined his speech at a distance\nand cut him off through some unknown sort of telepathic mesmerism\u00e2\u0080\u0094some\npower of the kind she had displayed at school. Certainly, she suspected\nthat he told me things, for as the weeks passed she tried to stop his\nvisits with words and glances of a most inexplicable potency. Only with\ndifficulty could he get to see me, for although he would pretend to be\ngoing somewhere else, some invisible force would generally clog his\nmotions or make him forget his destination for the time being. His\nvisits usually came when Asenath was away\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"away in her own body,\" as\nhe once oddly put it. She always found out later\u00e2\u0080\u0094the servants watched\nhis goings and comings\u00e2\u0080\u0094but evidently she thought it inexpedient to do\nanything drastic.\n\n4\n\nDerby had been married more than three years on that August day when I\ngot that telegram from Maine. I had not seen him for two months, but\nhad heard he was away \"on business\". Asenath was supposed to be with\nhim, though watchful gossip declared there was someone upstairs in\nthe house behind the doubly curtained windows. They had watched the\npurchases made by the servants. And now the town marshal of Chesuncook\nhad wired of the draggled madman who stumbled out of the woods with\ndelirious ravings and screamed to me for protection. It was Edward\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\nhe had been just able to recall his own name and address.\n\nChesuncook is close to the wildest, deepest, and least explored forest\nbelt in Maine, and it took a whole day of feverish jolting through\nfantastic and forbidding scenery to get there in a car. I found Derby\nin a cell at the town farm, vacillating between frenzy and apathy. He\nknew me at once, and began pouring out a meaningless, half-incoherent\ntorrent of words in my direction.\n\n\"Dan\u00e2\u0080\u0094for God's sake! The pit of the shoggoths! Down the six thousand\nsteps ... the abomination of abominations.... I never would let her\ntake me, and then I found myself there\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00c3\u00a4! Shub-Niggurath!\u00e2\u0080\u0094The shape\nrose up from the altar, and there were five hundred that howled\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\nHooded Thing bleated 'Kamog! Kamog!'\u00e2\u0080\u0094that was old Ephraim's secret\nname in the coven\u00e2\u0080\u0094I was there, where she promised she wouldn't take\nme\u00e2\u0080\u0094A minute before I was locked in the library, and then I was there\nwhere she had gone with my body\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the place of utter blasphemy, the\nunholy pit where the black realm begins and the watcher guards the\ngate\u00e2\u0080\u0094I saw a shoggoth\u00e2\u0080\u0094it changed shape\u00e2\u0080\u0094I can't stand it\u00e2\u0080\u0094I'll kill\nher if she ever sends me there again\u00e2\u0080\u0094I'll kill that entity\u00e2\u0080\u0094her, him,\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0094I'll kill it! I'll kill it with my own hands!\"\n\n\"The pit of the shoggoths! Down the six thousand steps ... the abomination of abominations.\"\n\nIt took me an hour to quiet him, but he subsided at last. The next\nday I got him decent clothes in the village, and set out with him\nfor Arkham. His fury of hysteria was spent, and he was inclined to\nbe silent, though he began muttering darkly to himself when the car\npassed through Augusta\u00e2\u0080\u0094as if the sight of a city aroused unpleasant\nmemories. It was clear that he did not wish to go home; and considering\nthe fantastic delusions he seemed to have about his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0094delusions\nundoubtedly springing from some actual hypnotic ordeal to which he had\nbeen subjected\u00e2\u0080\u0094I thought it would be better if he did not. I would, I\nresolved, put him up myself for a time, no matter what unpleasantness\nit would make with Asenath. Later I would help him get a divorce, for\nmost assuredly there were mental factors which made this marriage\nsuicidal for him. When we struck open country again Derby's muttering\nfaded away, and I let him nod and drowse on the seat beside me as I\ndrove.\n\nDuring our sunset dash through Portland the muttering commenced again,\nmore distinctly than before, and as I listened I caught a stream of\nutterly insane drivel about Asenath. The extent to which she had\npreyed on Edward's nerves was plain, for he had woven a whole set\nof hallucinations around her. His present predicament, he mumbled\nfurtively, was only one of a long series. She was getting hold of him,\nand he knew that some day she would never let go. Even now she probably\nlet him go only when she had to, because she couldn't hold on long at\na time. She constantly took his body and went to nameless places for\nnameless rites, leaving him in her body and locking him upstairs\u00e2\u0080\u0094but\nsometimes she couldn't hold on, and he would find himself suddenly in\nhis own body again in some far-off, horrible and perhaps unknown place.\nSometimes she'd get hold of him again and sometimes she couldn't. Often\nhe was left stranded somewhere as I had found him; time and again he\nhad to find his way home from frightful distances, getting somebody to\ndrive the car after he found it.\n\nThe worst thing was that she was holding on to him longer and longer\nat a time. She wanted to be a man\u00e2\u0080\u0094to be fully human\u00e2\u0080\u0094that was why she\ngot hold of him. She had sensed the mixture of fine-wrought brain and\nweak will in him. Some day she would crowd him out and disappear with\nhis body\u00e2\u0080\u0094disappear to become a great magician like her father and\nleave him marooned in that female shell that wasn't even quite human.\nYes, he knew about the Innsmouth blood now. There had been traffic with\nthings from the sea\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was horrible.... And old Ephraim\u00e2\u0080\u0094he had known\nthe secret, and when he grew old did a hideous thing to keep alive\u00e2\u0080\u0094he\nwanted to live for ever\u00e2\u0080\u0094Asenath would succeed\u00e2\u0080\u0094one successful\ndemonstration had taken place already.\n\nAs Derby muttered on I turned to look at him closely, verifying\nthe impression of change which an earlier scrutiny had given me.\nParadoxically, he seemed in better shape than usual\u00e2\u0080\u0094harder, more\nnormally developed, and without the trace of sickly flabbiness caused\nby his indolent habits. It was as if he had been really active\nand properly exercised for the first time in his coddled life, and\nI judged that Asenath's force must have pushed him into unwonted\nchannels of motion and alertness. But just now his mind was in a\npitiable state; for he was mumbling wild extravagances about his wife,\nabout black magic, about old Ephraim, and about some revelation which\nwould convince even me. He repeated names which I recognized from\nbygone browsings in forbidden volumes, and at times made me shudder\nwith a certain thread of mythological consistency\u00e2\u0080\u0094of convincing\ncoherence\u00e2\u0080\u0094which ran through his maundering. Again and again he would\npause, as if to gather courage for some final and terrible disclosure.\n\n\"Dan, Dan, don't you remember him\u00e2\u0080\u0094the wild eyes and the unkempt beard\nthat never turned white? He glared at me once, and I never forgot\nit. Now she glares that way. And I know why! He found it in the Necronomicon \u00e2\u0080\u0094the formula. I don't dare tell you the page yet, but\nwhen I do you can read and understand. Then you will know what has\nengulfed me. On, on, on, on\u00e2\u0080\u0094body to body to body\u00e2\u0080\u0094he means never to\ndie. The life-glow\u00e2\u0080\u0094he knows how to break the link ... it can flicker\non a while even when the body is dead. I'll give you hints and maybe\nyou'll guess. Listen, Dan\u00e2\u0080\u0094do you know why my wife always takes\nsuch pains with that silly back-hand writing? Have you ever seen a\nmanuscript of old Ephraim's? Do you want to know why I shivered when I\nsaw some hasty notes Asenath had jotted down?\n\n\"Asenath\u00e2\u0080\u0094 is there such a person? Why did they half think there was\npoison in old Ephraim's stomach? Why do the Gilmans whisper about the\nway he shrieked\u00e2\u0080\u0094like a frightened child\u00e2\u0080\u0094when he went mad and Asenath\nlocked him up in the padded attic room where\u00e2\u0080\u0094the other\u00e2\u0080\u0094had been? Was it old Ephraim's soul that was locked in? Who locked in whom? Why had he been looking for months for someone with a fine mind and a\nweak will? Why did he curse that his daughter wasn't a son? Tell me,\nDaniel Upton\u00e2\u0080\u0094 what devilish exchange was perpetrated in the house of\nhorror where that blasphemous monster had his trusting, weak-willed,\nhalf-human child at his mercy? Didn't he make it permanent\u00e2\u0080\u0094as she'll\ndo in the end with me? Tell me why that thing that calls itself Asenath\nwrites differently off guard, so that you can't tell its script\nfrom \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\nThen the thing happened. Derby's voice was rising to a thin treble\nscream as he raved, when suddenly it was shut off with an almost\nmechanical click. I thought of those other occasions at my home when\nhis confidences had abruptly ceased\u00e2\u0080\u0094when I had half fancied that some\nobscure telepathic wave of Asenath's mental force was intervening to\nkeep him silent. This, though, was something altogether different\u00e2\u0080\u0094and,\nI felt, infinitely more horrible. The face beside me was twisted almost\nunrecognizably for a moment, while through the whole body there passed\na shivering motion\u00e2\u0080\u0094as if all the bones, organs, muscles, nerves, and\nglands were re-adjusting themselves to a radically different posture,\nset of stresses, and general personality.\n\nJust where the supreme horror lay, I could not for my life tell;\nyet there swept over me such a swamping wave of sickness and\nrepulsion\u00e2\u0080\u0094such a freezing, petrifying sense of utter alienage and\nabnormality\u00e2\u0080\u0094that my grasp of the wheel grew feeble and uncertain. The\nfigure beside me seemed less like a life-long friend than like some\nmonstrous intrusion from outer space\u00e2\u0080\u0094some damnable, utterly accursed\nfocus of unknown and malign cosmic forces.\n\nI had faltered only a moment, but before another moment was over my\ncompanion had seized the wheel and forced me to change places with him.\nThe dusk was now very thick, and the lights of Portland far behind; so\nI could not see much of his face. The blaze of his eyes, though, was\nphenomenal; and I knew that he must now be in that queerly energized\nstate\u00e2\u0080\u0094so unlike his usual self\u00e2\u0080\u0094which so many people had noticed. It\nseemed odd and incredible that listless Edward Derby\u00e2\u0080\u0094he who could\nnever assert himself, and who had never learned to drive\u00e2\u0080\u0094should be\nordering me about and taking the wheel of my own car; yet that was\nprecisely what had happened. He did not speak for some time, and in my\ninexplicable horror I was glad he did not.\n\nIn the lights of Biddeford and Saco I saw his firmly set mouth, and\nshivered at the blaze of his eyes. The people were right\u00e2\u0080\u0094he did look\ndamnably like his wife and like old Ephraim when in these moods. I did\nnot wonder that the moods were disliked\u00e2\u0080\u0094there was certainly something\nunnatural in them, and I felt the sinister element all the more because\nof the wild ravings I had been hearing. This man, for all my life-long\nknowledge of Edward Pickman Derby, was a stranger\u00e2\u0080\u0094an intrusion of some\nsort from the black abyss.\n\nHe did not speak until we were on a dark stretch of road, and when he\ndid his voice seemed utterly unfamiliar. It was deeper, firmer, and\nmore decisive than I had ever known it to be; while its accent and\npronunciation were altogether changed\u00e2\u0080\u0094though vaguely, remotely, and\nrather disturbingly recalling something I could not quite place. There\nwas, I thought, a trace of very profound and very genuine irony in the\ntimbre\u00e2\u0080\u0094not the flashy, meaninglessly jaunty pseudo-irony of the callow\n\"sophisticate\", which Derby had habitually affected, but something\ngrim, basic, pervasive, and potentially evil. I marveled at the\nself-possession so soon following the spell of panic-struck muttering.\n\n\"I hope you'll forget my attack back there, Upton,\" he was saying. \"You\nknow what my nerves are, and I guess you can excuse such things. I'm\nenormously grateful, of course, for this lift home.\n\n\"And you must forget, too, any crazy things I may have been saying\nabout my wife\u00e2\u0080\u0094and about things in general. That's what comes from\noverstudy in a field like mine. My philosophy is full of bizarre\nconcepts, and when the mind gets worn out it cooks up all sorts of\nimaginary concrete applications. I shall take a rest from now on\u00e2\u0080\u0094you\nprobably won't see me for some time, and you needn't blame Asenath for\nit.\n\n\"This trip was a bit queer, but it's really very simple. There are\ncertain Indian relics in the north woods\u00e2\u0080\u0094standing stones, and all\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0094which mean a good deal in folklore, and Asenath and I are\nfollowing that stuff up. It was a hard search, so I seem to have gone\noff my head. I must send somebody for the car when I get home. A\nmonth's relaxation will put me on my feet.\"\n\nI do not recall just what my own part of the conversation was, for the\nbaffling alienage of my seatmate filled all my consciousness. With\nevery moment my feeling of elusive cosmic horror increased, till at\nlength I was in a virtual delirium of longing for the end of the drive.\nDerby did not offer to relinquish the wheel, and I was glad of the\nspeed with which Portsmouth and Newburyport flashed by.\n\nAt the junction where the main highway runs inland and avoids\nInnsmouth, I was half afraid my driver would take the bleak shore road\nthat goes through that damnable place. He did not, however, but darted\nrapidly past Rowley and Ipswich toward our destination. We reached\nArkham before midnight, and found the lights still on at the old\nCrowninshield house. Derby left the car with a hasty repetition of his\nthanks, and I drove home alone with a curious feeling of relief. It had\nbeen a terrible drive\u00e2\u0080\u0094all the more terrible because I could not quite\ntell why\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I did not regret Derby's forecast of a long absence from\nmy company.\n\n5\n\nThe next two months were full of rumors. People spoke of seeing Derby\nmore and more in his new energized state, and Asenath was scarcely\never in to her callers. I had only one visit from Edward, when he\ncalled briefly in Asenath's car\u00e2\u0080\u0094duly reclaimed from wherever he had\nleft it in Maine\u00e2\u0080\u0094to get some books he had lent me. He was in his new\nstate, and paused only long enough for some evasively polite remarks.\nIt was plain that he had nothing to discuss with me when in this\ncondition\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I noticed that he did not even trouble to give the old\nthree-and-two signal when ringing the door-bell. As on that evening\nin the car, I felt a faint, infinitely deep horror which I could not\nexplain; so that his swift departure was a prodigious relief.\n\nIn mid-September Derby was away for a week, and some of the decadent\ncollege set talked knowingly of the matter\u00e2\u0080\u0094hinting at a meeting\nwith a notorious cult-leader, lately expelled from England, who had\nestablished head-quarters in New York. For my part I could not get\nthat strange ride from Maine out of my head. The transformation I had\nwitnessed had affected me profoundly, and I caught myself again and\nagain trying to account for the thing\u00e2\u0080\u0094and for the extreme horror it\nhad inspired in me.\n\nBut the oddest rumors were those about the sobbing in the old\nCrowninshield house. The voice seemed to be a woman's, and some of the\nyounger people thought it sounded like Asenath's. It was heard only\nat rare intervals, and would sometimes be choked off as if by force.\nThere was talk of an investigation, but this was dispelled one day when\nAsenath appeared in the streets and chatted in a sprightly way with a\nlarge number of acquaintances\u00e2\u0080\u0094apologizing for her recent absence and\nspeaking incidentally about the nervous breakdown and hysteria of a\nguest from Boston. The guest was never seen, but Asenath's appearance\nleft nothing to be said. And then someone complicated matters by\nwhispering that the sobs had once or twice been in a man's voice.\n\nOne evening in mid-October I heard the familiar three-and-two ring at\nthe front door. Answering it myself, I found Edward on the steps, and\nsaw in a moment that his personality was the old one which I had not\nencountered since the day of his ravings on that terrible ride from\nChesuncook. His face was twitching with a mixture of odd emotions\nin which fear and triumph seemed to share dominion, and he looked\nfurtively over his shoulder as I closed the door behind him.\n\nFollowing me clumsily to the study, he asked for some whisky to\nsteady his nerves. I forbore to question him, but waited till he felt\nlike beginning whatever he wanted to say. At length he ventured some\ninformation in a choking voice.\n\n\"Asenath has gone, Dan. We had a long talk last night while the\nservants were out, and I made her promise to stop preying on me. Of\ncourse I had certain\u00e2\u0080\u0094certain occult defenses I never told you about.\nShe had to give in, but got frightfully angry. Just packed up and\nstarted for New York\u00e2\u0080\u0094walked right out to catch the 8:20 in to Boston.\nI suppose people will talk, but I can't help that. You needn't mention\nthat there was any trouble\u00e2\u0080\u0094just say she's gone on a long research trip.\n\n\"She's probably going to stay with one of her horrible groups of\ndevotees. I hope she'll go west and get a divorce\u00e2\u0080\u0094anyhow, I've made\nher promise to keep away and let me alone. It was horrible, Dan\u00e2\u0080\u0094she\nwas stealing my body\u00e2\u0080\u0094crowding me out\u00e2\u0080\u0094making a prisoner of me. I lay\nlow and pretended to let her do it, but I had to be on the watch. I\ncould plan if I was careful, for she can't read my mind literally, or\nin detail. All she could read of my planning was a sort of general mood\nof rebellion\u00e2\u0080\u0094and she always thought I was helpless. Never thought I\ncould get the best of her ... but I had a spell or two that worked.\"\n\nDerby looked over his shoulder and took some more whisky.\n\n\"I paid off those damned servants this morning when they got back.\nThey were ugly about it, and asked questions, but they went. They're\nher kind\u00e2\u0080\u0094Innsmouth people\u00e2\u0080\u0094and were hand and glove with her. I hope\nthey'll let me alone\u00e2\u0080\u0094I didn't like the way they laughed when they\nwalked away. I must get as many of Dad's old servants again as I can.\nI'll move back home now.\n\n\"I suppose you think I'm crazy, Dan\u00e2\u0080\u0094but Arkham history ought to hint\nat things that back up what I've told you\u00e2\u0080\u0094and what I'm going to tell\nyou. You've seen one of the changes, too\u00e2\u0080\u0094in your car after I told you\nabout Asenath that day coming home from Maine. That was when she got\nme\u00e2\u0080\u0094drove me out of my body. The last thing I remember was when I was\nall worked up trying to tell you what that she-devil is . Then she\ngot me, and in a flash I was back at the house\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the library where\nthose damned servants had me locked up\u00e2\u0080\u0094and in that cursed fiend's\nbody ... that isn't even human.... You know it was she you must have\nridden home with\u00e2\u0080\u0094that preying wolf in my body\u00e2\u0080\u0094you ought to have known\nthe difference!\"\n\nI shuddered as Derby paused. Surely, I had known the difference\u00e2\u0080\u0094yet\ncould I accept an explanation as insane as this? But my distracted\ncaller was growing even wilder.\n\n\"I had to save myself\u00e2\u0080\u0094I had to, Dan! She'd have got me for good at\nHallowmass\u00e2\u0080\u0094they hold a Sabbat up there beyond Chesuncook, and the\nsacrifice would have clinched things. She'd have got me for good\u00e2\u0080\u0094she'd\nhave been I, and I'd have been she\u00e2\u0080\u0094for ever\u00e2\u0080\u0094too late\u00e2\u0080\u0094My body'd have\nbeen hers for good\u00e2\u0080\u0094She'd have been a man, and fully human, just as she\nwanted to be\u00e2\u0080\u0094I suppose she'd have put me out of the way\u00e2\u0080\u0094killed her\nown ex-body with me in it, damn her, just as she did before \u00e2\u0080\u0094just as\nshe, he, or it did before\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\nEdward's face was now atrociously distorted, and he bent it\nuncomfortably close to mine as his voice fell to a whisper.\n\n\"You must know what I hinted in the car\u00e2\u0080\u0094 that she isn't Asenath at\nall, but really old Ephraim himself . I suspected it a year and a half\nago, and I know it now. Her handwriting shows it when she goes off\nguard\u00e2\u0080\u0094sometimes she jots down a note in writing that's just like her\nfather's manuscripts, stroke for stroke\u00e2\u0080\u0094and sometimes she says things\nthat nobody but an old man like Ephraim could say. He changed forms\nwith her when he felt death coming\u00e2\u0080\u0094she was the only one he could find\nwith the right kind of brain and a weak enough will\u00e2\u0080\u0094he got her body\npermanently, just as she almost got mine, and then poisoned the old\nbody he'd put her into. Haven't you seen old Ephraim's soul glaring out\nof that she-devil's eyes dozens of times\u00e2\u0080\u0094and out of mine when she has\ncontrol of my body?\"\n\nThe whisperer was panting, and paused for breath. I said nothing, and\nwhen he resumed, his voice was nearer normal. This, I reflected, was\na case for the asylum, but I would not be the one to send him there.\nPerhaps time and freedom from Asenath would do its work. I could see\nthat he would never wish to dabble in morbid occultism again.\n\n\"I'll tell you more later\u00e2\u0080\u0094I must have a long rest now. I'll tell you\nsomething of the forbidden horrors she led me into\u00e2\u0080\u0094something of the\nage-old horrors that even now are festering in out-of-the-way corners\nwith a few monstrous priests to keep them alive. Some people know\nthings about the universe that nobody ought to know, and can do things\nthat nobody ought to be able to do. I've been in it up to my neck, but\nthat's the end. Today I'd burn that damned Necronomicon and all the\nrest if I were librarian at Miskatonic.\n\n\"But she can't get me now. I must get out of that accursed house as\nsoon as I can, and settle down at home. You'll help me, I know, if I\nneed help. Those devilish servants, you know\u00e2\u0080\u0094and if people should\nget too inquisitive about Asenath. You see, I can't give them her\naddress.... Then there are certain groups of searchers\u00e2\u0080\u0094certain cults,\nyou know\u00e2\u0080\u0094that might misunderstand our breaking up ... some of them\nhave damnably curious ideas and methods. I know you'll stand by me if\nanything happens\u00e2\u0080\u0094even if I have to tell you a lot that will shock\nyou....\"\n\nI had Edward stay and sleep in one of the guest-chambers that night,\nand in the morning he seemed calmer. We discussed certain possible\narrangements for his moving back into the Derby mansion, and I hoped he\nwould lose no time in making the change.\n\nHe did not call the next evening, but I saw him frequently during\nthe ensuing weeks. We talked as little as possible about strange and\nunpleasant things, but discussed the renovation of the old Derby house,\nand the travels which Edward promised to take with my son and me the\nfollowing summer.\n\nOf Asenath we said almost nothing, for I saw that the subject was a\npeculiarly disturbing one. Gossip, of course, was rife; but that was no\nnovelty in connection with the strange menage at the old Crowninshield\nhouse. One thing I did not like was what Derby's banker let fall in an\nover-expansive mood at the Miskatonic Club\u00e2\u0080\u0094about the checks Edward was\nsending regularly to a Moses and Abigail Sargent and a Eunice Babson in\nInnsmouth. That looked as if those evil-faced servants were extorting\nsome kind of tribute from him\u00e2\u0080\u0094yet he had not mentioned the matter to\nme.\n\nI wished that the summer\u00e2\u0080\u0094and my son's Harvard vacation\u00e2\u0080\u0094would come,\nso that we could get Edward to Europe. He was not, I soon saw, mending\nas rapidly as I had hoped he would; for there was something a bit\nhysterical in his occasional exhilaration, while his moods of fright\nand depression were altogether too frequent. The old Derby house was\nready by December, yet Edward constantly put off moving. Though he\nhated and seemed to fear the Crowninshield place, he was at the same\ntime queerly enslaved by it. He could not seem to begin dismantling\nthings, and invented every kind of excuse to postpone action. When\nI pointed this out to him he appeared unaccountably frightened.\nHis father's old butler\u00e2\u0080\u0094who was there with other re-acquired\nservants\u00e2\u0080\u0094told me one day that Edward's occasional prowlings about the\nhouse, and especially down cellar, looked odd and unwholesome to him. I\nwondered if Asenath had been writing disturbing letters, but the butler\nsaid there was no mail which could have come from her.\n\nIt was about Christmas that Derby broke down one evening while calling\non me. I was steering the conversation toward next summer's travels\nwhen he suddenly shrieked and leaped up from his chair with a look of\nshocking, uncontrollable fright\u00e2\u0080\u0094a cosmic panic and loathing such as\nonly the nether gulfs of nightmare could bring to any sane mind.\n\n\"My brain! My brain! God, Dan\u00e2\u0080\u0094it's tugging\u00e2\u0080\u0094from\nbeyond\u00e2\u0080\u0094knocking\u00e2\u0080\u0094clawing\u00e2\u0080\u0094that she-devil\u00e2\u0080\u0094even now\u00e2\u0080\u0094Ephraim\u00e2\u0080\u0094Kamog!\nKamog!\u00e2\u0080\u0094The pit of the shoggoths\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00c3\u00a4! Shub-Niggurath! The Goat with a\nThousand Young!...\n\n\"The flame\u00e2\u0080\u0094the flame\u00e2\u0080\u0094beyond body, beyond life\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the earth\u00e2\u0080\u0094oh,\nGod!...\"\n\nI pulled him back to his chair and poured some wine down his throat\nas his frenzy sank to a dull apathy. He did not resist, but kept his\nlips moving as if talking to himself. Presently I realized that he was\ntrying to talk to me, and bent my ear to his mouth to catch the feeble\nwords.\n\n\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094again, again\u00e2\u0080\u0094she's trying\u00e2\u0080\u0094I might have known\u00e2\u0080\u0094nothing can stop\nthat force; not distance, nor magic, nor death\u00e2\u0080\u0094it comes and comes,\nmostly in the night\u00e2\u0080\u0094I can't leave\u00e2\u0080\u0094it's horrible\u00e2\u0080\u0094oh, God, Dan, if\nyou only knew as I do just how horrible it is !...\"\n\nWhen he had slumped down into a stupor I propped him with pillows and\nlet normal sleep overtake him. I did not call a doctor, for I knew what\nwould be said of his sanity, and wished to give nature a chance if I\npossibly could. He waked at midnight, and I put him to bed upstairs,\nbut he was gone by morning. He had let himself quietly out of the\nhouse\u00e2\u0080\u0094and his butler, when called on the wire, said he was at home\npacing restlessly about the library.\n\n6\n\nEdward went to pieces rapidly after that. He did not call again, but\nI went daily to see him. He would always be sitting in his library,\nstaring at nothing and having an air of abnormal listening . Sometimes\nhe talked rationally, but always on trivial topics. Any mention of his\ntrouble, of future plans, or of Asenath would send him into a frenzy.\nHis butler said he had frightful seizures at night, during which he\nmight eventually do himself harm.\n\nI had a long talk with his doctor, banker, and lawyer, and finally took\nthe physician with two specialist colleagues to visit him. The spasms\nthat resulted from the first questions were violent and pitiable\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\nthat evening a closed car took his poor struggling body to the\nArkham Sanitarium. I was made his guardian and called on him twice\nweekly\u00e2\u0080\u0094almost weeping to hear his wild shrieks, awesome whispers, and\ndreadful, droning repetitions of such phrases as \"I had to do it\u00e2\u0080\u0094I had\nto do it\u00e2\u0080\u0094it'll get me\u00e2\u0080\u0094it'll get me\u00e2\u0080\u0094down there\u00e2\u0080\u0094down there in the\ndark\u00e2\u0080\u0094Mother! Mother! Dan! Save me\u00e2\u0080\u0094save me\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\nHow much hope of recovery there was, no one could say, but I tried\nmy best to be optimistic. Edward must have a home if he emerged, so\nI transferred his servants to the Derby mansion, which would surely\nbe his sane choice. What to do about the Crowninshield place with its\ncomplex arrangements and collections of utterly inexplicable objects I\ncould not decide, so left it momentarily untouched\u00e2\u0080\u0094telling the Derby\nhousehold to go over and dust the chief rooms once a week, and ordering\nthe furnace man to have a fire on those days.\n\nThe final nightmare came before Candlemas\u00e2\u0080\u0094heralded, in cruel irony,\nby a false gleam of hope. One morning late in January the sanitarium\ntelephoned to report that Edward's reason had suddenly come back. His\ncontinuous memory, they said, was badly impaired; but sanity itself was\ncertain. Of course he must remain some time for observation, but there\ncould be little doubt of the outcome. All going well, he would surely\nbe free in a week.\n\nI hastened over in a flood of delight, but stood bewildered when a\nnurse took me to Edward's room. The patient rose to greet me, extending\nhis hand with a polite smile; but I saw in an instant that he bore the\nstrangely energized personality which had seemed so foreign to his own\nnature\u00e2\u0080\u0094the competent personality I had found so vaguely horrible,\nand which Edward himself had once vowed was the intruding soul of his\nwife. There was the same blazing vision\u00e2\u0080\u0094so like Asenath's and old\nEphraim's\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the same firm mouth! and when he spoke I could sense the\nsame grim, pervasive irony in his voice\u00e2\u0080\u0094the deep irony so redolent of\npotential evil. This was the person who had driven my car through the\nnight five months before\u00e2\u0080\u0094the person I had not seen since that brief\ncall when he had forgotten the old-time door-bell signal and stirred\nsuch nebulous fears in me\u00e2\u0080\u0094and now he filled me with the same dim\nfeeling of blasphemous alienage and ineffable cosmic hideousness.\n\nHe spoke affably of arrangements for release\u00e2\u0080\u0094and there was nothing\nfor me to do but assent, despite some remarkable gaps in his recent\nmemories. Yet I felt that something was terribly, inexplicably wrong\nand abnormal. There were horrors in this thing that I could not reach.\nThis was a sane person\u00e2\u0080\u0094but was it indeed the Edward Derby I had known?\nIf not, who or what was it\u00e2\u0080\u0094and where was Edward? Ought it to be free\nor confined\u00e2\u0080\u0094or ought it to be extirpated from the face of the earth?\nThere was a hint of the abysmally sardonic in everything the creature\nsaid\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Asenath-like eyes lent a special and baffling mockery to\ncertain words about the early liberty earned by an especially close\nconfinement ! I must have behaved very awkwardly, and was glad to beat\na retreat.\n\nAll that day and the next I racked my brain over the problem. What had\nhappened? What sort of mind looked out through those alien eyes in\nEdward's face? I could think of nothing but this dimly terrible enigma,\nand gave up all efforts to perform my usual work. The second morning\nthe hospital called up to say that the recovered patient was unchanged,\nand by evening I was close to a nervous collapse\u00e2\u0080\u0094a state I admit,\nthough others will vow it colored my subsequent vision. I have nothing\nto say on this point except that no madness of mine could account for all the evidence.\n\n7\n\nIt was in the night\u00e2\u0080\u0094after that second evening\u00e2\u0080\u0094that stark, utter\nhorror burst over me and weighted my spirit with a black, clutching\npanic from which it can never shake free. It began with a telephone\ncall just before midnight. I was the only one up, and sleepily took\ndown the receiver in the library. No one seemed to be on the wire,\nand I was about to hang up and go to bed when my ear caught a very\nfaint suspicion of sound at the other end. Was someone trying under\ngreat difficulties to talk? As I listened I thought I heard a sort\nof half-liquid bubbling noise\u00e2\u0080\u0094\" glub ... glub ... glub \"\u00e2\u0080\u0094which\nhad an odd suggestion of inarticulate, unintelligible word and\nsyllable divisions. I called, \"Who is it?\" But the only answer was\n\" glub-glub ... glub-glub .\" I could only assume that the noise was\nmechanical; but fancying that it might be a case of a broken instrument\nable to receive but not to send, I added, \"I can't hear you. Better\nhang up and try Information.\" Immediately I heard the receiver go on\nthe hook at the other end.\n\nThis, I say, was just before midnight. When that call was traced\nafterward it was found to come from the old Crowninshield house, though\nit was fully half a week from the housemaid's day to be there. I shall\nonly hint what was found at that house\u00e2\u0080\u0094the upheaval in a remote cellar\nstoreroom, the tracks, the dirt, the hastily rifled wardrobe, the\nbaffling marks on the telephone, the clumsily used stationery, and the\ndetestable stench lingering over everything. The police, poor fools,\nhave their smug little theories, and are still searching for those\nsinister discharged servants\u00e2\u0080\u0094who have dropped out of sight amidst the\npresent furor. They speak of a ghoulish revenge for things that were\ndone, and say I was included because I was Edward's best friend and\nadviser.\n\nIdiots! do they fancy those brutish clowns could have forged that\nhandwriting? Do they fancy they could have brought what later came? Are\nthey blind to the changes in that body that was Edward's? As for me, I now believe all that Edward Derby ever told me . There are horrors\nbeyond life's edge that we do not suspect, and once in a while man's\nevil prying calls them just within our range. Ephraim\u00e2\u0080\u0094Asenath\u00e2\u0080\u0094that\ndevil called them in, and they engulfed Edward as they are engulfing\nme.\n\nCan I be sure that I am safe? Those powers survive the life of the\nphysical form. The next day\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the afternoon, when I pulled out of my\nprostration and was able to walk and talk coherently\u00e2\u0080\u0094I went to the\nmadhouse and shot him dead for Edward's and the world's sake, but can I\nbe sure till he is cremated? They are keeping the body for some silly\nautopsies by different doctors\u00e2\u0080\u0094but I say he must be cremated. He must\nbe cremated\u00e2\u0080\u0094he who was not Edward Derby when I shot him. I shall go\nmad if he is not, for I may be the next. But my will is not weak\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\nI shall not let it be undermined by the terrors I know are seething\naround it. One life\u00e2\u0080\u0094Ephraim, Asenath, and Edward\u00e2\u0080\u0094who now? I will\nnot be driven out of my body ... I will not change souls with that\nbullet-ridden lich in the madhouse!\n\nBut let me try to tell coherently of that final horror. I will not\nspeak of what the police persistently ignored\u00e2\u0080\u0094the tales of that\ndwarfed, grotesque, malodorous thing met by at least three wayfarers\nin High Street just before two o'clock, and the nature of the single\nfootprints in certain places. I will say only that just about two the\ndoor-bell and knocker waked me\u00e2\u0080\u0094door-bell and knocker both, plied\nalternately and uncertainly in a kind of weak desperation, and each\ntrying to keep to Edward's old signal of three-and-two strokes .\n\nRoused from sound sleep, my mind leaped into a turmoil. Derby at the\ndoor\u00e2\u0080\u0094and remembering the old code! That new personality had not\nremembered it ... was Edward suddenly back in his rightful state? Why\nwas he here in such evident stress and haste? Had he been released\nahead of time, or had he escaped? Perhaps, I thought as I flung on a\nrobe and bounded downstairs, his return to his own self had brought\nraving and violence, revoking his discharge and driving him to a\ndesperate dash for freedom. Whatever had happened, he was good old\nEdward again, and I would help him!\n\nWhen I opened the door into the elm-arched blackness a gust of\ninsufferably fetid wind almost flung me prostrate. I choked in nausea,\nand for a second scarcely saw the dwarfed, humped figure on the steps.\nThe summons had been Edward's, but who was this foul, stunted parody?\nWhere had Edward had time to go? His ring had sounded only a second\nbefore the door opened.\n\nThe caller had on one of Edward's overcoats\u00e2\u0080\u0094its bottom almost touching\nthe ground, and its sleeves rolled back yet still covering the hands.\nOn the head was a slouch hat pulled low, while a black silk muffler\nconcealed the face. As I stepped unsteadily forward, the figure made a\nsemi-liquid sound like that I had heard over the telephone\u00e2\u0080\u0094\" glub ...\nglub \"\u00e2\u0080\u0094and thrust at me a large, closely written paper impaled on the\nend of a long pencil. Still reeling from the morbid and unaccountable\nfetor, I seized the paper and tried to read it in the light from the\ndoorway.\n\nBeyond question, it was in Edward's script. But why had he written\nwhen he was close enough to ring\u00e2\u0080\u0094and why was the script so awkward,\ncoarse and shaky? I could make out nothing in the dim half-light, so\nedged back into the hall, the dwarf figure clumping mechanically after\nbut pausing on the inner door's threshold. The odor of this singular\nmessenger was really appalling, and I hoped (not in vain, thank God!)\nthat my wife would not wake and confront it.\n\nThen, as I read the paper, I felt my knees give under me and my vision\ngo black. I was lying on the floor when I came to, that accursed sheet\nstill clutched in my fear-rigid hand. This is what it said:\n\n\"Dan\u00e2\u0080\u0094go to the sanitarium and kill it. Exterminate it. It isn't\nEdward Derby any more. She got me\u00e2\u0080\u0094it's Asenath\u00e2\u0080\u0094 and she has been\ndead three months and a half . I lied when I said she had gone away.\nI killed her. I had to. It was sudden, but we were alone and I was in\nmy right body. I saw a candlestick and smashed her head in. She would\nhave got me for good at Hallowmass.\n\n\"I buried her in the farther cellar storeroom under some old boxes and\ncleaned up all the traces. The servants suspected next morning, but\nthey have such secrets that they dare not tell the police. I sent them\noff, but God knows what they\u00e2\u0080\u0094and others of the cult\u00e2\u0080\u0094will do.\n\n\"I thought for a while I was all right, and then I felt the tugging at\nmy brain. I knew what it was\u00e2\u0080\u0094I ought to have remembered. A soul like\nhers\u00e2\u0080\u0094or Ephraim's\u00e2\u0080\u0094is half detached, and keeps right on after death\nas long as the body lasts. She was getting me\u00e2\u0080\u0094making me change bodies\nwith her\u00e2\u0080\u0094 seizing my body and putting me in that corpse of hers\nburied in the cellar .\n\n\"I knew what was coming\u00e2\u0080\u0094that's why I snapped and had to go to the\nasylum. Then it came\u00e2\u0080\u0094I found myself choked in the dark\u00e2\u0080\u0094in Asenath's\nrotting carcass down there in the cellar under the boxes where I put\nit. And I knew she must be in my body at the sanitarium\u00e2\u0080\u0094permanently,\nfor it was after Hallowmass, and the sacrifice would work even without\nher being there\u00e2\u0080\u0094sane, and ready for release as a menace to the world.\nI was desperate, and in spite of everything I clawed my way out .\n\n\"I'm too far gone to talk\u00e2\u0080\u0094I couldn't manage to telephone\u00e2\u0080\u0094but I can\nstill write. I'll get fixed up somehow and bring this last word and\nwarning. Kill that fiend if you value the peace and comfort of the\nworld. See that it is cremated. If you don't, it will live on and\non, body to body for ever, and I can't tell you what it will do. Keep\nclear of black magic, Dan\u00e2\u0080\u0094it's the devil's business. Good-bye\u00e2\u0080\u0094you've\nbeen a great friend. Tell the police whatever they'll believe\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\nI'm damnably sorry to drag all this on you. I'll be at peace before\nlong\u00e2\u0080\u0094this thing won't hold together much more. Hope you can read\nthis. And kill that thing\u00e2\u0080\u0094kill it.\n\n\"Yours\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Ed. \"\n\nIt was only afterward that I read the last half of this paper, for I\nhad fainted at the end of the third paragraph. I fainted again when I\nsaw and smelled what cluttered up the threshold where the warm air had\nstruck it. The messenger would not move or have consciousness any more.\n\nThe butler, tougher-fibered than I, did not faint at what met him in\nthe hall in the morning. Instead, he telephoned the police. When they\ncame I had been taken upstairs to bed, but the\u00e2\u0080\u0094other mass\u00e2\u0080\u0094lay where\nit had collapsed in the night. The men put handkerchiefs to their noses.\n\nWhat they finally found inside Edward's oddly-assorted clothes was\nmostly liquescent horror. There were bones, too\u00e2\u0080\u0094and a crushed-in\nskull. Some dental work positively identified the skull as Asenath's.",
