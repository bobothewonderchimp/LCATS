Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\nWhen Randolph Carter was thirty he lost the key to the gate of dreams.\nPrior to that time he had made up for the prosiness of life by nightly\nexcursions to strange and ancient cities beyond space, and lovely,\nunbelievable garden lands across ethereal seas; but as middle age\nhardened upon him he felt these liberties slipping away little by\nlittle, until at last he was cut off altogether. No more could his\ngalleys sail up the river Oukranos past the gilded spires of Thran, or\nhis elephant caravans tramp through perfumed jungles in Kled, where\nforgotten palaces with veined ivory columns sleep lovely and unbroken\nunder the moon.\n\nHe had read too much of things as they are, and talked with too many\npeople. Well-meaning philosophers had taught him to look into the\nlogical relations of things, and analyze the processes which shaped\nhis thoughts and fancies. Wonder had gone away, and he had forgotten\nthat all life is only a set of pictures in the brain, among which\nthere is no difference betwixt those born of real things and those\nborn of inward dreamings, and no cause to value the one above the\nother. Custom had dinned into his ears a superstitious reverence for\nthat which tangibly and physically exists, and had made him secretly\nashamed to dwell in visions. Wise men told him his simple fancies were\ninane and childish, and he believed it because he could see that they\nmight easily be so. What he failed to recall was that the deeds of\nreality are just as inane and childish, and even more absurd because\ntheir actors persist in fancying them full of meaning and purpose as\nthe blind purpose grinds aimlessly on from nothing to something back to\nnothing again, neither heeding nor knowing the wishes or existence of\nthe minds that flicker for a second now and then in the darkness.\n\nThey had chained him down to things that are, and had then explained\nthe workings of those things till mystery had gone out of the world.\nWhen he complained, and longed to escape into twilight realms where\nmagic molded all the little vivid fragments and prized associations of\nhis mind into vistas of breathless expectancy and unquenchable delight,\nthey turned him instead toward the new-found prodigies of science,\nbidding him find wonder in the atom's vortex and mystery in the sky's\ndimensions. And when he had failed to find these boons in things whose\nlaws are known and measurable, they told him he lacked imagination, and\nwas immature because he preferred dream-illusions to the illusions of\nour physical creation.\n\nSo Carter had tried to do as others did, and pretended that the common\nevents and emotions of earthly minds were more important than the\nfantasies of rare and delicate souls. He did not dissent when they told\nhim that the animal pain of a stuck pig or dyspeptic plowman in real\nlife is a greater thing than the peerless beauty of Narath with its\nhundred carven gates and domes of chalcedony, which he dimly remembered\nfrom his dreams; and under their guidance he cultivated a painstaking\nsense of pity and tragedy.\n\nOnce in a while, though, he could not help seeing how shallow, fickle,\nand meaningless all human aspirations are, and how emptily our real\nimpulses contrast with those pompous ideals we profess to hold. Then\nhe would have recourse to the polite laughter they had taught him to\nuse against the extravagance and artificiality of dreams; for he saw\nthat the daily life of our world is every inch as extravagant and\nartificial, and far less worthy of respect because of its poverty in\nbeauty and its silly reluctance to admit its own lack of reason and\npurpose. In this way he became a kind of humorist, for he did not see\nthat even humor is empty in a mindless universe devoid of any true\nstandard of consistency or inconsistency.\n\nIn the first days of his bondage he had turned to the gentle churchly\nfaith endeared to him by the na\u00c3\u00afve trust of his fathers, for thence\nstretched mystic avenues which seemed to promise escape from life. Only\non closer view did he mark the starved fancy and beauty, the stale and\nprosy triteness, and the owlish gravity and grotesque claims of solid\ntruth which reigned boresomely and overwhelmingly among most of its\nprofessors; or feel to the full the awkwardness with which it sought to\nkeep alive as literal fact the outgrown fears and guesses of a primal\nrace confronting the unknown. It wearied Carter to see how solemnly\npeople tried to make earthly reality out of old myths which every step\nof their boasted science confuted, and this misplaced seriousness\nkilled the attachment he might have kept for the ancient creeds had\nthey been content to offer the sonorous rites and emotional outlets in\ntheir true guise of ethereal fantasy.\n\nBut when he came to study those who had thrown off the old myths,\nhe found them even more ugly than those who had not. They did not\nknow that beauty lies in harmony, and that loveliness of life has no\nstandard amidst an aimless cosmos save only its harmony with the\ndreams and the feelings which have gone before and blindly molded our\nlittle spheres out of the rest of chaos. They did not see that good and\nevil and beauty and ugliness are only ornamental fruits of perspective,\nwhose sole value lies in their linkage to what chance made our fathers\nthink and feel, and whose fine details are different for every race\nand culture. Instead, they either denied these things altogether or\ntransferred them to the crude, vague instincts which they shared with\nthe beasts and peasants; so that their lives were dragged malodorously\nout in pain, ugliness, and disproportion, yet filled with a ludicrous\npride at having escaped from something no more unsound than that which\nstill held them. They had traded the false gods of fear and blind piety\nfor those of license and anarchy.\n\nCarter did not taste deeply of these modern freedoms; for their\ncheapness and squalor sickened a spirit loving beauty alone, while\nhis reason rebelled at the flimsy logic with which their champions\ntried to gild brute impulse with a sacredness stripped from the idols\nthey had discarded. He saw that most of them, in common with their\ncast-off priestcraft, could not escape from the delusion that life\nhas a meaning apart from that which men dream into it; and could not\nlay aside the crude notion of ethics and obligations beyond those\nof beauty, even when all Nature shrieked of its unconsciousness and\nimpersonal unmorality in the light of their scientific discoveries.\nWarped and bigoted with preconceived illusions of justice, freedom,\nand consistency, they cast off the old lore and the old ways with the\nold beliefs; nor ever stopped to think that that lore and those ways\nwere the sole makers of their present thoughts and judgments, and the\nsole guides and standards in a meaningless universe without fixed\naims or stable points of reference. Having lost these artificial\nsettings, their lives grew void of direction and dramatic interest;\ntill at length they strove to drown their ennui in bustle and pretended\nusefulness, noise and excitement, barbaric display and animal\nsensation. When these things palled, disappointed, or grew nauseous\nthrough revulsion, they cultivated irony and bitterness, and found\nfault with the social order. Never could they realize that their brute\nfoundations were as shifting and contradictory as the gods of their\nelders, and that the satisfaction of one moment is the bane of the\nnext. Calm, lasting beauty comes only in dream, and this solace the\nworld had thrown away when in its worship of the real it threw away the\nsecrets of childhood and innocence.\n\nAmidst this chaos of hollowness and unrest Carter tried to live as\nbefitted a man of keen thought and good heritage. With his dreams\nfading under the ridicule of the age he could not believe in anything,\nbut the love of harmony kept him close to the ways of his race and\nstation. He walked impassive through the cities of men, and sighed\nbecause no vista seemed fully real; because every flash of yellow\nsunlight on tall roofs and every glimpse of balustraded plazas in the\nfirst lamps of evening served only to remind him of dreams he had once\nknown, and to make him homesick for ethereal lands he no longer knew\nhow to find. Travel was only a mockery; and even the Great War stirred\nhim but little, though he served from the first in the Foreign Legion\nof France. For a while he sought friends, but soon grew weary of the\ncrudeness of their emotions, and the sameness and earthiness of their\nvisions. He felt vaguely glad that all his relatives were distant and\nout of touch with him, for they could not have understood his mental\nlife. That is, none but his grandfather and great-uncle Christopher\ncould, and they were long dead.\n\nThen he began once more the writing of books, which he had left off\nwhen dreams first failed him. But here, too, was there no satisfaction\nor fulfilment; for the touch of earth was upon his mind, and he could\nnot think of lovely things as he had done of yore. Ironic humor\ndragged down all the twilight minarets he reared, and the earthy fear\nof improbability blasted all the delicate and amazing flowers in his\nfaery gardens. The convention of assumed piety spilt mawkishness on\nhis characters, while the myth of an important reality and significant\nhuman events and emotions debased all his high fantasy into thin-veiled\nallegory and cheap social satire. His new novels were successful as his\nold ones had never been; and because he knew how empty they must be to\nplease an empty herd, he burned them and ceased his writing. They were\nvery graceful novels, in which he urbanely laughed at the dreams he\nlightly sketched; but he saw that their sophistication had sapped all\ntheir life away.\n\nIt was after this that he cultivated deliberate illusion, and dabbled\nin the notions of the bizarre and the eccentric as an antidote for the\ncommonplace. Most of these, however, soon showed their poverty and\nbarrenness; and he saw that the popular doctrines of occultism are as\ndry and inflexible as those of science, yet without even the slender\npalliative of truth to redeem them. Gross stupidity, falsehood, and\nmuddled thinking are not dream; and form no escape from life to a mind\ntrained above their level. So Carter bought stranger books and sought\nout deeper and more terrible men of fantastic erudition; delving into\narcana of consciousness that few have trod, and learning things about\nthe secret pits of life, legend, and immemorial antiquity which\ndisturbed him ever afterward. He decided to live on a rarer plane, and\nfurnished his Boston home to suit his changing moods; one room for\neach, hung in appropriate colors, furnished with befitting books and\nobjects, and provided with sources of the proper sensations of light,\nheat, sound, taste, and odor.\n\nOnce he heard of a man in the South who was shunned and feared for\nthe blasphemous things he read in prehistoric books and clay tablets\nsmuggled from India and Arabia. Him he visited, living with him and\nsharing his studies for seven years, till horror overtook them one\nmidnight in an unknown and archaic graveyard, and only one emerged\nwhere two had entered. Then he went back to Arkham, the terrible\nwitch-haunted old town of his forefathers in New England, and had\nexperiences in the dark, amidst the hoary willows and tottering gambrel\nroofs, which made him seal for ever certain pages in the diary of a\nwild-minded ancestor. But these horrors took him only to the edge of\nreality, and were not of the true dream country he had known in youth;\nso that at fifty he despaired of any rest or contentment in a world\ngrown too busy for beauty and too shrewd for dream.\n\nHaving perceived at last the hollowness and futility of real things,\nCarter spent his days in retirement, and in wistful disjointed memories\nof his dream-filled youth. He thought it rather silly that he bother\nto keep on living at all, and got from a South American acquaintance\na very curious liquid to take him to oblivion without suffering.\nInertia and force of habit, however, caused him to defer action; and\nhe lingered indecisively among thoughts of old times, taking down the\nstrange hangings from his walls and refitting the house as it was in\nhis early boyhood\u00e2\u0080\u0094purple panes, Victorian furniture, and all.\n\nWith the passage of time he became almost glad he had lingered, for\nhis relics of youth and his cleavage from the world made life and\nsophistication seem very distant and unreal; so much so that a touch of\nmagic and expectancy stole back into his nightly slumbers. For years\nthose slumbers had known only such twisted reflections of every-day\nthings as the commonest slumbers know, but now there returned a\nflicker of something stranger and wilder; something of vaguely awesome\nimmanence which took the form of tensely clear pictures from his\nchildhood days, and made him think of little inconsequential things he\nhad long forgotten. He would often awake calling for his mother and\ngrandfather, both in their graves a quarter of a century.\n\nThen one night his grandfather reminded him of the key. The gray\nold scholar, as vivid as in life, spoke long and earnestly of their\nancient line, and of the strange visions of the delicate and sensitive\nmen who composed it. He spoke of the flame-eyed Crusader who learnt\nwild secrets of the Saracens that held him captive; and of the first\nSir Randolph Carter who studied magic when Elizabeth was queen. He\nspoke, too, of that Edmund Carter who had just escaped hanging in the\nSalem witchcraft, and who had placed in an antique box a great silver\nkey handed down from his ancestors. Before Carter awaked, the gentle\nvisitant had told him where to find that box; that carved oak-box of\narchaic wonder whose grotesque lid no hand had raised for two centuries.\n\nIn the dust and shadows of the great attic he found it, remote and\nforgotten at the back of a drawer in a tall chest. It was about a foot\nsquare, and its Gothic carvings were so fearful that he did not marvel\nno person since Edmund Carter had dared open it. It gave forth no noise\nwhen shaken, but was mystic with the scent of unremembered spices. That\nit held a key was indeed only a dim legend, and Randolph Carter's\nfather had never known such a box existed. It was bound in rusty iron,\nand no means was provided for working the formidable lock. Carter\nvaguely understood that he would find within it some key to the lost\ngate of dreams, but of where and how to use it his grandfather had told\nhim nothing.\n\nAn old servant forced the carven lid, shaking as he did so at the\nhideous faces leering from the blackened wood, and at some unplaced\nfamiliarity. Inside, wrapped in a discolored parchment, was a huge\nkey of tarnished silver covered with cryptical arabesques; but of any\nlegible explanation there was none. The parchment was voluminous, and\nheld only the strange hieroglyphs of an unknown tongue written with an\nantique reed. Carter recognized the characters as those he had seen\non a certain papyrus scroll belonging to that terrible scholar of the\nSouth who had vanished one midnight in a nameless cemetery. The man had\nalways shivered when he read this scroll, and Carter shivered now.\n\nBut he cleaned the key, and kept it by him nightly in its aromatic box\nof ancient oak. His dreams were meanwhile increasing in vividness, and\nthough showing him none of the strange cities and incredible gardens\nof the old days, were assuming a definite cast whose purpose could not\nbe mistaken. They were calling him back along the years, and with the\nmingled wills of all his fathers were pulling him toward some hidden\nand ancestral source. Then he knew he must go into the past and merge\nhimself with old things, and day after day he thought of the hills\nto the north where haunted Arkham and the rushing Miskatonic and the\nlonely rustic homestead of his people lay.\n\nIn the brooding fire of autumn Carter took the old remembered way past\ngraceful lines of rolling hill and stone-walled meadow, distant vale\nand hanging woodland, curving road and nestling farmstead, and the\ncrystal windings of the Miskatonic, crossed here and there by rustic\nbridges of wood or stone. At one bend he saw a group of giant elms\namong which an ancestor had oddly vanished a century and a half before,\nand shuddered as the wind blew meaningly through them. Then there was\nthe crumbling farmhouse of old Goody Fowler the witch, with its little\nevil windows and great roof sloping nearly to the ground on the north\nside. He speeded up his car as he passed it, and did not slacken till\nhe had mounted the hill where his mother and her fathers before her\nwere born, and where the old white house still looked proudly across\nthe road at the breathlessly lovely panorama of rocky slope and verdant\nvalley, with the distant spires of Kingsport on the horizon, and hints\nof the archaic, dream-laden sea in the farthest background.\n\nThen came the steeper slope that held the old Carter place he had not\nseen in over forty years. Afternoon was far gone when he reached the\nfoot, and at the bend half-way up he paused to scan the outspread\ncountryside golden and glorified in the slanting floods of magic poured\nout by a western sun. All the strangeness and expectancy of his recent\ndreams seemed present in this hushed and unearthly landscape, and he\nthought of the unknown solitudes of other planets as his eyes traced\nout the velvet and deserted lawns shining undulant between their\ntumbled walls, the clumps of faery forest setting off far lines of\npurple hills beyond hills, and the spectral wooded valley dipping down\nin shadow to dank hollows where trickling waters crooned and gurgled\namong swollen and distorted roots.\n\nSomething made him feel that motors did not belong in the realm he was\nseeking, so he left his car at the edge of the forest, and putting the\ngreat key in his coat pocket walked on up the hill. Woods now engulfed\nhim utterly, though he knew the house was on a high knoll that cleared\nthe trees except to the north. He wondered how it would look, for it\nhad been left vacant and untended through his neglect since the death\nof his strange great-uncle Christopher thirty years before. In his\nboyhood he had reveled through long visits there, and had found weird\nmarvels in the woods beyond the orchard.\n\nShadows thickened around him, for the night was near. Once a gap in\nthe trees opened up to the right, so that he saw off across leagues of\ntwilight meadow and spied the old Congregational steeple on Central\nHill in Kingsport; pink with the last flush of day, the panes of the\nlittle round windows blazing with reflected fire. Then, when he was in\ndeep shadow again, he recalled with a start that the glimpse must have\ncome from childish memory alone, since the old white church had long\nbeen torn down to make room for the Congregational Hospital. He had\nread of it with interest, for the paper had told about some strange\nburrows or passages found in the rocky hill beneath.\n\nThrough his puzzlement a voice piped, and he started again at its\nfamiliarity after long years. Old Benijah Corey had been his Uncle\nChristopher's hired man, and was aged even in those far-off times of\nhis boyhood visits. Now he must be well over a hundred, but that piping\nvoice could come from no one else. He could distinguish no words, yet\nthe tone was haunting and unmistakable. To think that \"Old Benijy\"\nshould still be alive!\n\n\"Mister Randy! Mister Randy! Whar be ye? D'ye want to skeer yer Aunt\nMarthy plumb to death? Hain't she tuld ye to keep nigh the place in\nthe arternoon an' git back afur dark? Randy! Ran\u00e2\u0080\u0094dee!... He's the\nbeatin'est boy fer runnin' off in the woods I ever see; haff the time\na-settin' moonin' raound that snake-den in the upper timber-lot!...\nHey, yew, Ran\u00e2\u0080\u0094dee!\"\n\nRandolph Carter stopped in the pitch darkness and rubbed his hand\nacross his eyes. Something was queer. He had been somewhere he ought\nnot to be; had strayed very far away to places where he had not\nbelonged, and was now inexcusably late. He had not noticed the time on\nthe Kingsport steeple, though he could easily have made it out with\nhis pocket telescope; but he knew his lateness was something very\nstrange and unprecedented. He was not sure he had his little telescope\nwith him, and put his hand in his blouse pocket to see. No, it was\nnot there, but there was the big silver key he had found in a box\nsomewhere. Uncle Chris had told him something odd once about an old\nunopened box with a key in it, but Aunt Martha had stopped the story\nabruptly, saying it was no kind of thing to tell a child whose head was\nalready too full of queer fancies. He tried to recall just where he\nhad found the key, but something seemed very confused. He guessed it\nwas in the attic at home in Boston, and dimly remembered bribing Parks\nwith half his week's allowance to help him open the box and keep quiet\nabout it; but when he remembered this, the face of Parks came up very\nstrangely, as if the wrinkles of long years had fallen upon the brisk\nlittle cockney.\n\n\"Ran\u00e2\u0080\u0094dee! Ran\u00e2\u0080\u0094dee! Hi! Hi! Randy!\"\n\nA swaying lantern came around the black bend, and old Benijah pounced\non the silent and bewildered form of the pilgrim.\n\n\"Durn ye, boy, so thar ye be! Ain't ye got a tongue in yer head, that\nye can't answer a body? I ben callin' this haff hour, an' ye must a\nheerd me long ago! Don't ye know yer Aunt Marthy's all a-fidget over\nyer bein' off arter dark? Wait till I tell yer Uncle Chris when he\ngets hum! Ye'd orta know these here woods ain't no fitten place to be\ntraipsin' this hour! They's things abroad what dun't do nobody no good,\nas my gran'sir' knowed afur me. Come, Mister Randy, or Hannah wun't\nkeep supper no longer!\"\n\nSo Randolph Carter was marched up the road where wondering stars\nglimmered through high autumn boughs. And dogs barked as the yellow\nlight of small-paned windows shone out at the farther turn, and the\nPleiades twinkled across the open knoll where a great gambrel roof\nstood black against the dim west. Aunt Martha was in the doorway, and\ndid not scold too hard when Benijah shoved the truant in. She knew\nUncle Chris well enough to expect such things of the Carter blood.\nRandolph did not show his key, but ate his supper in silence and\nprotested only when bedtime came. He sometimes dreamed better when\nawake, and he wanted to use that key.\n\nIn the morning Randolph was up early, and would have run off to the\nupper timber-lot if Uncle Chris had not caught him and forced him\ninto his chair by the breakfast table. He looked impatiently around\nthe low-pitched room with the rag carpet and exposed beams and\ncorner-posts, and smiled only when the orchard boughs scratched at the\nlittle leaded panes of the rear window. The trees and the hills were\nclose to him, and formed the gates of that timeless realm which was his\ntrue country.\n\nThen, when he was free, he felt in his blouse pocket for the key; and\nbeing reassured, skipped off across the orchard to the rise beyond,\nwhere the wooded hill climbed again to heights above even the treeless\nknoll. The floor of the forest was mossy and mysterious, and great\nlichened rocks rose vaguely here and there in the dim light like druid\nmonoliths among the swollen and twisted trunks of a sacred grove. Once\nin his ascent Randolph crossed a rushing stream whose falls a little\nway off sang runic incantations to the lurking fauns and \u00c3\u00a6gipans and\ndryads.\n\nThen he came to the strange cave in the forest slope, the dreaded\n\"snake-den\" which country folk shunned, and away from which Benijah had\nwarned him again and again. It was deep; far deeper than anyone but\nRandolph suspected, for the boy had found a fissure in the farthermost\nblack corner that led to a loftier grotto beyond\u00e2\u0080\u0094a haunting sepulchral\nplace whose granite walls held a curious illusion of conscious\nartifice. On this occasion he crawled in as usual, lighting his way\nwith matches filched from the sitting-room match-safe, and edging\nthrough the final crevice with an eagerness hard to explain even to\nhimself. He could not tell why he approached the farther wall so\nconfidently, or why he instinctively drew forth the great silver key as\nhe did so. But on he went, and when he danced back to the house that\nnight he offered no excuses for his lateness, nor heeded in the least\nthe reproofs he gained for ignoring the noontide dinner-horn altogether.\n\nNow it is agreed by all the distant relatives of Randolph Carter that\nsomething occurred to heighten his imagination in his tenth year. His\ncousin, Ernest B. Aspinwall, Esq., of Chicago, is fully ten years his\nsenior and distinctly recalls a change in the boy after the autumn of\n1883. Randolph had looked on scenes of fantasy that few others can\never have beheld, and stranger still were some of the qualities which\nhe showed in relation to very mundane things. He seemed, in fine, to\nhave picked up an odd gift of prophecy; and reacted unusually to things\nwhich, though at the time without meaning, were later found to justify\nthe singular impressions. In subsequent decades as new inventions,\nnew names, and new events appeared one by one in the book of history,\npeople would now and then recall wonderingly how Carter had years\nbefore let fall some careless word of undoubted connection with what\nwas then far in the future. He did not himself understand these words,\nor know why certain things made him feel certain emotions; but fancied\nthat some unremembered dream must be responsible. It was as early as\n1897 that he turned pale when some traveler mentioned the French town\nof Belloy-en-Santerre, and friends remembered it when he was almost\nmortally wounded there in 1916, while serving with the Foreign Legion\nin the Great War.\n\nCarter's relatives talk much of these things because he has lately\ndisappeared. His little old servant Parks, who for years bore patiently\nwith his vagaries, last saw him on the morning he drove off alone in\nhis car with a key he had recently found. Parks had helped him get the\nkey from the old box containing it, and had felt strangely affected by\nthe grotesque carvings on the box, and by some other odd quality he\ncould not name. When Carter left, he had said he was going to visit his\nold ancestral country around Arkham.\n\nHalf-way up Elm Mountain, on the way to the ruins of the old Carter\nplace, they found his motor set carefully by the roadside; and in it\nwas a box of fragrant wood with carvings that frightened the countrymen\nwho stumbled on it. The box held only a queer parchment whose\ncharacters no linguist or paleographer has been able to decipher or\nidentify. Rain had long effaced any possible footprints, though Boston\ninvestigators had something to say about evidences of disturbances\namong the fallen timbers of the Carter place. It was, they averred,\nas though someone had groped about the ruins at no distant period. A\ncommon white handkerchief found among the forest rocks on the hillside\nbeyond can not be identified as belonging to the missing man.\n\nThere is talk of apportioning Randolph Carter's estate among his heirs,\nbut I shall stand firmly against this course because I do not believe\nhe is dead. There are twists of time and space, of vision and reality,\nwhich only a dreamer can divine; and from what I know of Carter I think\nhe has merely found a way to traverse these mazes. Whether or not he\nwill ever come back, I can not say. He wanted the lands of dreams he\nhad lost, and yearned for the days of his childhood. Then he found a\nkey, and I somehow believe he was able to use it to strange advantage.\n\n\"There the bearded and finny Gnorri build their labyrinths.\"\n\nI shall ask him when I see him, for I expect to meet him shortly in\na certain dream-city we both used to haunt. It is rumored in Ulthar,\nbeyond the River Skai, that a new king reigns on the opal throne of\nIlek-Vad, that fabulous town of turrets atop the hollow cliffs of glass\noverlooking the twilight sea wherein the bearded and finny Gnorri build\ntheir singular labyrinths, and I believe I know how to interpret this\nrumor. Certainly, I look forward impatiently to the sight of that great\nsilver key, for in its cryptical arabesques there may stand symbolized\nall the aims and mysteries of a blindly impersonal cosmos.",
