So the youth answered:\n\n\"I am Iranon, and come from Aira, a far city that I recall only dimly\nbut seek to find again. I am a singer of songs that I learned in the\nfar city, and my calling is to make beauty with the things remembered\nof childhood. My wealth is in little memories and dreams, and in hopes\nthat I sing in gardens when the moon is tender and the west wind stirs\nthe lotus-buds.\"\n\nWhen the men of Teloth heard these things they whispered to one\nanother; for though in the granite city there is no laughter or\nsong, the stern men sometimes look to the Karthian hills in the\nspring and think of the lutes of distant Oonai whereof travelers have\ntold. And thinking thus, they bade the stranger stay and sing in the\nsquare before the Tower of Mlin, though they liked not the color of\nhis tattered robe, nor the myrrh in his hair, nor his chaplet of\nvine-leaves, nor the youth in his golden voice. At evening Iranon\nsang, and while he sang an old man prayed and a blind man said he saw\na nimbus over the singer's head. But most of the men of Teloth yawned,\nand some laughed and some went away to sleep; for Iranon told nothing\nuseful, singing only his memories, his dreams, and his hopes.\n\n\"I remember the twilight, the moon, and soft songs, and the window\nwhere I was rocked to sleep. And through the window was the street\nwhere the golden lights came, and where the shadows danced on houses of\nmarble. I remember the square of moonlight on the floor, that was not\nlike any other light, and the visions that danced in the moonbeams when\nmy mother sang to me. And too, I remember the sun of morning bright\nabove the many-colored hills in summer, and the sweetness of flowers\nborne on the south wind that made the trees sing.\n\n\"O Aira, city of marble and beryl, how many are thy beauties! How loved\nI the warm and fragrant groves across the hyaline Nithra, and the falls\nof the tiny Kra that flowed through the verdant valley! In those groves\nand in that vale the children wove wreaths for one another, and at dusk\nI dreamed strange dreams under the yath-trees on the mountain as I saw\nbelow me the lights of the city, and the curving Nithra reflecting a\nribbon of stars.\n\n\"And in the city were palaces of veined and tinted marble, with\ngolden domes and painted walls, and green gardens with cerulean pools\nand crystal fountains. Often I played in the gardens and waded in the\npools, and lay and dreamed among the pale flowers under the trees. And\nsometimes at sunset I would climb the long hilly street to the citadel\nand the open place, and look down upon Aira, the magic city of marble\nand beryl, splendid in a robe of golden flame.\n\n\"Long have I missed thee, Aira, for I was but young when we went into\nexile; but my father was thy King and I shall come again to thee, for\nit is so decreed of Fate. All through seven lands have I sought thee,\nand some day shall I reign over thy groves and gardens, thy streets and\npalaces, and sing to men who shall know whereof I sing, and laugh not.\nFor I am Iranon, who was a Prince in Aira.\"\n\nThat night the men of Teloth lodged the stranger in a stable, and in\nthe morning an archon came to him and told him to go to the shop of\nAthok the cobbler, and be apprenticed to him.\n\n\"But I am Iranon, a singer of songs,\" he said, \"and have no heart for\nthe cobbler's trade.\"\n\n\"All in Teloth must toil,\" replied the archon, \"for that is the law.\"\nThen said Iranon:\n\n\"Wherefore do ye toil; is it not that ye may live and be happy? And if\nye toil only that ye may toil more, when shall happiness find you? Ye\ntoil to live, but is not life made of beauty and song? And if ye suffer\nno singers among you, where shall be the fruits of your toil? Toil\nwithout song is like a weary journey without an end. Were not death\nmore pleasing?\" But the archon was sullen and did not understand, and\nrebuked the stranger.\n\n\"Thou art a strange youth, and I like not thy face or thy voice. The\nwords thou speakest are blasphemy, for the gods of Teloth have said\nthat toil is good. Our gods have promised us a haven of life beyond\ndeath, where there shall be rest without end, and crystal coldness\namidst which none shall vex his mind with thought or his eyes with\nbeauty. Go thou then to Athok the cobbler or be gone out of the city by\nsunset. All here must serve, and song is folly.\"\n\n\"Beyond the Karthian hills lieth Oonai, the city of\nlutes and dancing.\"\n\nSo Iranon went out of the stable and walked over the narrow stone\nstreets between the gloomy square houses of granite, seeking something\ngreen, for all was of stone. On the faces of men were frowns, but by\nthe stone embankment along the sluggish river Zuro sate a young boy\nwith sad eyes gazing into the waters to spy green budding branches\nwashed down from the hills by the freshets. And the boy said to him:\n\"Art thou not indeed he of whom the archons tell, who seekest a far\ncity in a fair land? I am Romnod, and born in the blood of Teloth,\nbut am not old in the ways of the granite city, and yearn daily for\nthe warm groves and the distant lands of beauty and song. Beyond\nthe Karthian hills lieth Oonai, the city of lutes and dancing, which\nmen whisper of and say is both lovely and terrible. Thither would I\ngo were I old enough to find the way, and thither shouldst thou go\nand thou wouldst sing and have men listen to thee. Let us leave the\ncity Teloth and fare together among the hills of spring. Thou shalt\nshow me the ways of travel and I will attend thy songs at evening\nwhen the stars one by one bring dreams to the minds of dreamers. And\nperadventure it may be that Oonai the city of lutes and dancing is even\nthe fair Aira thou seekest, for it is told that thou hast not known\nAira since old days, and a name often changeth. Let us go to Oonai,\nO Iranon of the golden head, where men shall know our longings and\nwelcome us as brothers, nor ever laugh or frown at what we say.\" And\nIranon answered:\n\n\"Be it so, small one; if any in this stone place yearn for beauty he\nmust seek the mountains and beyond, and I would not leave thee to pine\nby the sluggish Zuro. But think not that delight and understanding\ndwell just across the Karthian hills, or in any spot thou canst find\nin a day's, or a year's, or a lustrum's journey. Behold, when I was\nsmall like thee I dwelt in the valley of Narthos by the frigid Xari,\nwhere none would listen to my dreams; and I told myself that when\nolder I would go to Sinara on the southern slope, and sing to smiling\ndromedarymen in the market place. But when I went to Sinara I found the\ndromedarymen all drunken and ribald, and saw that their songs were not\nas mine; so I travelled in a barge down the Xari to onyx-walled Jaren.\nAnd the soldiers at Jaren laughed at me and drave me out, so that I\nwandered to other cities.\n\n\"I have seen Stethelos that is below the great cataract, and have gazed\non the marsh where Sarnath once stood. I have been to Thraa, Ilarnek,\nand Kadatheron on the winding river Ai, and have dwelt long in Olatho\u00c3\u00ab\nin the land of Lomar. But though I have had listeners sometimes,\nthey have ever been few, and I know that welcome shall wait me only\nin Aira, the city of marble and beryl where my father once ruled as\nKing. So for Aira shall we seek, though it were well to visit distant\nand lute-blessed Oonai across the Karthian hills, which may indeed be\nAira, though I think not. Aira's beauty is past imagining, and none can\ntell of it without rapture, whilst of Oonai the camel-drivers whisper\nleeringly.\"\n\nAt the sunset Iranon and small Romnod went forth from Teloth, and for\nlong wandered amidst the green hills and cool forests. The way was\nrough and obscure, and never did they seem nearer to Oonai the city of\nlutes and dancing; but in the dusk as the stars came out Iranon would\nsing of Aira and its beauties and Romnod would listen, so that they\nwere both happy after a fashion. They ate plentifully of fruit and\nred berries, and marked not the passing of time, but many years must\nhave slipped away. Small Romnod was now not so small, and spoke deeply\ninstead of shrilly, though Iranon was always the same, and decked his\ngolden hair with vines and fragrant resins found in the woods. So it\ncame to pass one day that Romnod seemed older than Iranon, though\nhe had been very small when Iranon had found him watching for green\nbudding branches in Teloth beside the sluggish stone-banked Zura.\n\nThen one night when the moon was full the travellers came to a mountain\ncrest and looked down upon the myriad lights of Oonai. Peasants had\ntold them they were near, and Iranon knew that this was not his\nnative city of Aira. The lights of Oonai were not like those of Aira;\nfor they were harsh and glaring, whilst the lights of Aira shine as\nsoftly and magically as shone the moonlight on the floor by the window\nwhere Iranon's mother once rocked him to sleep with song. But Oonai\nwas a city of lutes and dancing; so Iranon and Romnod went down the\nsteep slope that they might find men to whom songs and dreams would\nbring pleasure. And when they were come into the town they found\nrose-wreathed revellers bound from house to house and leaning from\nwindows and balconies, who listened to the songs of Iranon and tossed\nhim flowers and applauded when he was done. Then for a moment did\nIranon believe he had found those who thought and felt even as he,\nthough the town was not an hundredth so fair as Aira.\n\nWhen dawn came Iranon looked about with dismay, for the domes of\nOonai were not golden in the sun, but gray and dismal. And the men of\nOonai were pale with revelling, and dull with wine, and unlike the\nradiant men of Aira. But because the people had thrown him blossoms\nand acclaimed his songs Iranon stayed on, and with him Romnod, who\nliked the revelry of the town and wore in his dark hair roses and\nmyrtle. Often at night Iranon sang to the revellers, but he was\nalways as before, crowned only with the vine of the mountains and\nremembering the marble streets of Aira and the hyaline Nithra. In the\nfrescoed halls of the monarch did he sing, upon a crystal dais raised\nover a floor that was a mirror, and as he sang, he brought pictures\nto his hearers till the floor seemed to reflect old, beautiful and\nhalf-remembered things instead of the wine-reddened feasters who pelted\nhim with roses. And the King bade him put away his tattered purple, and\nclothed him in satin and cloth-of-gold, with rings of green jade and\nbracelets of tinted ivory, and lodged him in a gilded and tapestried\nchamber on a bed of sweet carven wood with canopies and coverlets of\nflower-embroidered silk. Thus dwelt Iranon in Oonai, the city of lutes\nand dancing.\n\nIt is not known how long Iranon tarried in Oonai, but one day the King\nbrought to the palace some wild whirling dancers from the Liranian\ndesert, and dusky flute-players from Drinen in the East, and after\nthat the revellers threw their roses not so much at Iranon as at the\ndancers and the flute-players. And day by day that Romnod who had been\na small boy in granite Teloth grew coarser and redder with wine, till\nhe dreamed less and less, and listened with less delight to the songs\nof Iranon. But though Iranon was sad he ceased not to sing, and at\nevening told again his dreams of Aira, the city of marble and beryl.\nThen one night the reddened and fattened Romnod snored heavily amidst\nthe poppied silks of his banquet-couch and died writhing, whilst\nIranon, pale and slender, sang to himself in a far corner. And when\nIranon had wept over the grave of Romnod and strewn it with green\nbudding branches, such as Romnod used to love, he put aside his silks\nand gauds and went forgotten out of Oonai the city of lutes and dancing\nclad only in the ragged purple in which he had come, and garlanded with\nfresh vines from the mountains.\n\nInto the sunset wandered Iranon, seeking still for his native land\nand for men who would understand and cherish his songs and dreams. In\nall the cities of Cydathria and in the lands beyond the Bnazic desert\ngay-faced children laughed at his olden songs and tattered robe of\npurple; but Iranon stayed ever young, and wore wreaths upon his golden\nhead whilst he sang of Aira.\n\nSo came he one night to the squalid cot of an antique shepherd, bent\nand dirty, who kept flocks on a stony slope above a quicksand marsh. To\nthis man Iranon spoke, as to so many others:\n\n\"Canst thou tell me where I may find Aira, the city of marble and\nberyl, where flows the hyaline Nithra and where the falls of the tiny\nKra sing to verdant valleys and hills forested with yath-trees?\" And\nthe shepherd, hearing, looked long and strangely at Iranon, as if\nrecalling something very far away in time, and noted each line of the\nstranger's face, and his golden hair, and his crown of vine-leaves. But\nhe was old, and replied:\n\n\"O stranger, I have indeed heard the name of Aira, and the other names\nthou hast spoken, but they come to me from afar down the waste of\nlong years. I heard them in my youth from the lips of a playmate, a\nbeggar's boy given to strange dreams, who would weave long tales about\nthe moon and the flowers and the west wind. We used to laugh at him,\nfor we knew him from his birth though he thought himself a King's son.\nHe was comely, even as thou, but full of folly and strangeness; and he\nran away when small to find those who would listen gladly to his songs\nand dreams. How often hath he sung to me of lands that never were, and\nthings that never can be! Of Aira did he speak much; of Aira and the\nriver Nithra, and the falls of the tiny Kra. There would he ever say he\nonce dwelt as a Prince, though here we knew him from his birth. Nor was\nthere ever a marble city of Aira, or those who could delight in strange\nsongs, save in the dreams of mine old playmate Iranon who is gone.\"\n\nAnd in the twilight, as the stars came out one by one and the moon cast\non the marsh a radiance like that which a child sees quivering on the\nfloor as he is rocked to sleep at evening, there walked into the lethal\nquicksands a very old man in tattered purple, crowned with withered\nvine leaves and gazing ahead as if upon the golden domes of a fair city\nwhere dreams are understood.\n\nThat night something of youth and beauty died in the elder world.",
