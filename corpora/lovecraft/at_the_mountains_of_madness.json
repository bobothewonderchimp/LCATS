Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\nI am forced into speech because men of science have refused to follow\nmy advice without knowing why. It is altogether against my will that\nI tell my reasons for opposing this contemplated invasion of the\nantarctic\u00e2\u0080\u0094with its vast fossil hunt and its wholesale boring and\nmelting of the ancient ice caps. And I am the more reluctant because my\nwarning may be in vain.\n\nDoubt of the real facts, as I must reveal them, is inevitable; yet,\nif I suppressed what will seem extravagant and incredible there would\nbe nothing left. The hitherto withheld photographs, both ordinary\nand a\u00c3\u00abrial, will count in my favor, for they are damnably vivid and\ngraphic. Still, they will be doubted because of the great lengths to\nwhich clever fakery can be carried. The ink drawings, of course, will\nbe jeered at as obvious impostures; notwithstanding a strangeness and\ntechnique which art experts ought to remark and puzzle over.\n\nIn the end I must rely on the judgment and standing of the few\nscientific leaders who have, on the one hand, sufficient independence\nof thought to weigh my data on its own hideously convincing merits or\nin the light of certain primordial and highly baffling myth cycles;\nand on the other hand, sufficient influence to deter the exploring\nworld in general from any rash and over-ambitious program in the region\nof those mountains of madness.\n\nIt is an unfortunate fact that relatively obscure men like myself and\nmy associates, connected only with a small university, have little\nchance of making an impression where matters of a wildly bizarre or\nhighly controversial natures are concerned.\n\nIt is further against us that we are not, in the strictest sense,\nspecialists in the fields which came primarily to be concerned. As a\ngeologist, my object in leading the Miskatonic University Expedition\nwas wholly that of securing deep-level specimens of rock and soil from\nvarious parts of the antarctic continent, aided by the remarkable drill\ndevised by Professor Frank H. Pabodie of our engineering department.\n\nI had no wish to be a pioneer in any other field than this, but I did\nhope that the use of this new mechanical appliance at different points\nalong previously explored paths would bring to light materials of a\nsort hitherto unreached by the ordinary methods of collection.\n\nPabodie's drilling apparatus, as the public already knows from our\nreports, was unique and radical in its lightness, portability, and\ncapacity to combine the ordinary Artesian drill principle with the\nprinciple of the small circular rock drill in such a way as to cope\nquickly with strata of varying hardness.\n\nSteel head, jointed rods, gasoline motor, collapsible wooden derrick,\ndynamiting paraphernalia, cording, rubbish-removal auger, and sectional\npiping for bores five inches wide and up to one thousand feet deep all\nformed, with needed accessories, no greater load than three seven-dog\nsledges could carry. This was made possible by the clever aluminum\nalloy of which most of the metal objects were fashioned.\n\nFour large Dornier a\u00c3\u00abroplanes, designed especially for the tremendous\naltitude flying necessary on the antarctic plateau and with added\nfuel-warming and quick-starting devices worked out by Pabodie, could\ntransport our entire expedition from a base at the edge of the great\nice barrier to various suitable inland points, and from these points a\nsufficient quota of dogs would serve us.\n\nWe planned to cover as great an area as one antarctic season\u00e2\u0080\u0094or\nlonger, if absolutely necessary\u00e2\u0080\u0094would permit, operating mostly in the\nmountain ranges and on the plateau south of Ross Sea; regions explored\nin varying degree by Shackleton, Amundsen, Scott, and Byrd. With\nfrequent changes of camp, made by a\u00c3\u00abroplane and involving distances\ngreat enough to be of geological significance, we expected to unearth a\nquite unprecedented amount of material\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially in the pre-Cambrian\nstrata of which so narrow a range of antarctic specimens had previously\nbeen secured.\n\nWe wished also to obtain as great as possible a variety of the upper\nfossiliferous rocks, since the primal life history of this bleak realm\nof ice and death is of the highest importance to our knowledge of the\nearth's past. That the antarctic continent was once temperate and\neven tropical, with a teeming vegetable and animal life of which the\nlichens, marine fauna, arachnida, and penguins of the northern edge are\nthe only survivors, is a matter of common information; and we hoped to\nexpand that information in variety, accuracy, and detail. When a simple\nboring revealed fossiliferous signs, we would enlarge the aperture by\nblasting, in order to get specimens of suitable size and condition.\n\nOur borings, of varying depth according to the promise held out by the\nupper soil or rock, were to be confined to exposed, or nearly exposed,\nland surfaces\u00e2\u0080\u0094these inevitably being slopes and ridges because of the\nmile or two-mile thickness of solid ice overlying the lower levels.\n\nWe could not afford to waste drilling depth on any considerable amount\nof more glaciation, though Pabodie had worked out a plan for sinking\ncopper electrodes in thick clusters of borings and melting off limited\nareas of ice with current from a gasoline-driven dynamo.\n\nIt is this plan\u00e2\u0080\u0094which we could not put into effect except\nexperimentally on an expedition such as ours\u00e2\u0080\u0094that the coming\nStarkweather-Moore Expedition proposes to follow, despite the warnings\nI have issued since our return from the antarctic.\n\nThe public knows of the Miskatonic Expedition through our frequent\nwireless reports to the Arkham Advertiser and Associated Press, and\nthrough the later articles by Pabodie and myself. We consisted of four\nmen from the University\u00e2\u0080\u0094Pabodie, Lake of the biology department,\nAtwood of the physics department\u00e2\u0080\u0094also a meteorologist\u00e2\u0080\u0094and myself,\nrepresenting geology and having nominal command, also sixteen\nassistants: seven graduate students from Miskatonic and nine skilled\nmechanics.\n\nOf these sixteen, twelve were qualified a\u00c3\u00abroplane pilots, all but two\nof whom were competent wireless operators. Eight of them understood\nnavigation with compass and sextant, as did Pabodie, Atwood and I. In\naddition, of course, our two ships\u00e2\u0080\u0094wooden exwhalers, reinforced for\nice conditions and having auxiliary steam\u00e2\u0080\u0094were fully manned.\n\nThe Nathaniel Derby Pickman Foundation, aided by a few special\ncontributions, financed the expedition; hence our preparations were\nextremely thorough, despite the absence of great publicity.\n\nThe dogs, sledges, machines, camp materials, and unassembled parts of\nour five planes were delivered in Boston, and there our ships were\nloaded.\n\nWe were marvelously well-equipped for our specific purposes, and in\nall matters pertaining to supplies, regimen, transportation, and camp\nconstruction we profited by the excellent example of our many recent\nand exceptionally brilliant predecessors. It was the unusual number and\nfame of these predecessors which made our own expedition\u00e2\u0080\u0094ample though\nit was\u00e2\u0080\u0094so little noticed by the world at large.\n\nAs the newspapers told, we sailed from Boston Harbor on September 2nd,\n1930, taking a leisurely course down the coast and through the Panama\nCanal, and stopping at Samoa and Hobart, Tasmania, at which latter\nplace we took on final supplies.\n\nNone of our exploring party had ever been in the polar regions before,\nhence we all relied greatly on our ship captains\u00e2\u0080\u0094J. B. Douglas,\ncommanding the brig Arkham , and serving as commander of the sea\nparty, and Georg Thorfinnssen, commanding the barque Miskatonic \u00e2\u0080\u0094both\nveteran whalers in antarctic waters.\n\nAs we left the inhabited world behind the sun sank lower and lower in\nthe north, and stayed longer and longer above the horizon each day.\nAt about 62\u00c2\u00b0 South Latitude we sighted our first icebergs\u00e2\u0080\u0094tablelike\nobjects with vertical sides\u00e2\u0080\u0094and just before reaching the antarctic\ncircle, which we crossed on October 20th with appropriately quaint\nceremonies, we were considerably troubled with field ice.\n\nThe falling temperature bothered me considerably after our long voyage\nthrough the tropics, but I tried to brace up for the worse rigors to\ncome. On many occasions the curious atmospheric effects enchanted me\nvastly; these included a strikingly vivid mirage\u00e2\u0080\u0094the first I had ever\nseen\u00e2\u0080\u0094in which distant bergs became the battlements of unimaginable\ncosmic castles.\n\nPushing through the ice, which was fortunately neither extensive\nnor thickly packed, we regained open water at South Latitude 67\u00c2\u00b0,\nEast Longitude 175\u00c2\u00b0. On the morning of October 26th a strong land\nblink appeared on the south, and before noon we all felt a thrill of\nexcitement at beholding a vast, lofty, and snow-clad mountain chain\nwhich opened out and covered the whole vista ahead. At last we had\nencountered an outpost of the great unknown continent and its cryptic\nworld of frozen death.\n\nThese peaks were obviously the Admiralty Range discovered by Ross, and\nit would now be our task to round Cape Adare and sail down the east\ncoast of Victoria Land to our contemplated base on the shore of McMurdo\nSound, at the foot of the volcano Erebus in South Latitude 77\u00c2\u00b0 9\u00c2\u00b4.\n\nThe last lap of the voyage was vivid and fancy-stirring. Great barren\npeaks of mystery loomed up constantly against the west as the low\nnorthern sun of noon or the still lower horizon-grazing southern sun of\nmidnight poured its hazy reddish rays over the white snow, bluish ice\nand water lanes, and black bits of exposed granite slope.\n\nThrough the desolate summits swept raging, intermittent gusts of\nthe terrible antarctic wind, whose cadences sometimes held vague\nsuggestions of a wild and half-sentient musical piping, with notes\nextending over a wide range, and which for some subconscious mnemonic\nreason seemed to me disquieting and even dimly terrible.\n\nSomething about the scene reminded me of the strange and disturbing\nAsian paintings of Nicholas Roerich, and of the still stranger and more\ndisturbing descriptions of the evilly fabled plateau of Leng which\noccur in the dreaded Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred. I\nwas rather sorry, later on, that I had ever looked into that monstrous\nbook at the college library.\n\nOn the 7th of November, sight of the westward range having been\ntemporarily lost, we passed Franklin Island; and the next day descried\nthe cones of Mts. Erebus and Terror on Ross Island ahead, with the long\nline of the Parry Mountains beyond. There now stretched off to the east\nthe low, white line of the great ice barrier, rising perpendicularly\nto a height of two hundred feet like the rocky cliffs of Quebec, and\nmarking the end of southward navigation.\n\nIn the afternoon we entered McMurdo Sound and stood off the coast in\nthe lee of smoking Mt. Erebus. The scoriaceous peak towered up some\ntwelve thousand seven hundred feet against the eastern sky, like a\nJapanese print of the sacred Fujiyama, while beyond it rose the white,\nghostlike height of Mt. Terror, ten thousand nine hundred feet in\naltitude, and now extinct as a volcano.\n\nPuffs of smoke from Erebus came intermittently, and one of the graduate\nassistants\u00e2\u0080\u0094a brilliant young fellow named Danforth\u00e2\u0080\u0094pointed out what\nlooked like lava on the snowy slope, remarking that this mountain,\ndiscovered in 1840, had undoubtedly been the source of Poe's image\nwhen he wrote seven years later:\n\nDanforth was a great reader of bizarre material, and had talked a\ngood deal of Poe. I was interested myself because of the antarctic\nscene of Poe's only long story\u00e2\u0080\u0094the disturbing and enigmatical Arthur\nGordon Pym . On the barren shore, and on the lofty ice barrier in the\nbackground, myriad of grotesque penguins squawked and flapped their\nfins, while many fat seals were visible on the water, swimming or\nsprawling across large cakes of slowly drifting ice.\n\nUsing small boats, we effected a difficult landing on Ross Island\nshortly after midnight, on the morning of the 9th, carrying a line of\ncable from each of the ships and preparing to unload supplies by means\nof a breeches-buoy arrangement.\n\nOur sensations on first treading antarctic soil were poignant and\ncomplex, even though at this particular point the Scott and Shackleton\nexpeditions had preceded us.\n\nOur camp on the frozen shore below the volcano's slope was only a\nprovisional one, headquarters being kept aboard the Arkham . We landed\nall our drilling apparatus, dogs, sledges, tents, provisions, gasoline\ntanks, experimental ice-melting outfit, cameras, both ordinary and\na\u00c3\u00abrial, a\u00c3\u00abroplane parts, and other accessories, including three small\nportable wireless outfits\u00e2\u0080\u0094besides those in the planes\u00e2\u0080\u0094capable of\ncommunicating with the Arkham's large outfit from any part of the\nantarctic continent that we would be likely to visit.\n\nThe ship's outfit, communicating with the outside world, was to convey\npress reports to the Arkham Advertiser's powerful wireless station\non Kingsport Head, Mass. We hoped to complete our work during a single\nantarctic summer; but if this proved impossible we would winter on the Arkham , sending the Miskatonic north before the freezing of the ice\nfor another summer's supplies.\n\nI need not repeat what the newspapers have already published about our\nearly work: of our ascent of Mt. Erebus; our successful mineral borings\nat several points on Ross Island and the singular speed with which\nPabodie's apparatus accomplished them, even through solid rock layers;\nour provisional test of the small ice-melting equipment; our perilous\nascent of the great barrier with sledges and supplies; and our final\nassembling of five huge a\u00c3\u00abroplanes at the camp atop the barrier.\n\nThe health of our land party\u00e2\u0080\u0094twenty men and fifty-five Alaskan sledge\ndogs\u00e2\u0080\u0094was remarkable, though of course we had so far encountered no\nreally destructive temperatures or windstorms.\n\nFor the most part, the thermometer varied between zero and 20\u00c2\u00b0 or 25\u00c2\u00b0\nabove, and our experience with New England winters had accustomed us to\nrigors of this sort. The barrier camp was semipermanent, and destined\nto be a storage cache for gasoline, provisions, dynamite, and other\nsupplies.\n\nOnly four of our planes were needed to carry the actual exploring\nmaterial, the fifth being left with a pilot and two men, from the\nships, at the storage cache to form a means of reaching us from the Arkham in case all our exploring planes were lost.\n\nLater, when not using all the other planes for moving apparatus, we\nwould employ one or two in a shuttle transportation service between\nthis cache and another permanent base on the great plateau from six\nhundred to seven hundred miles southward, beyond Beardmore Glacier.\n\nDespite the almost unanimous accounts of appalling winds and tempests\nthat pour down from the plateau, we determined to dispense with\nintermediate bases, taking our chances in the interest of economy and\nprobable efficiency.\n\nWireless reports have spoken of the breathtaking, four-hour, nonstop\nflight of our squadron on November 21st over the lofty shelf ice, with\nvast peaks rising on the west, and the unfathomed silences echoing to\nthe sound of our engines.\n\nWind troubled us only moderately, and our radio compasses helped us\nthrough the one opaque fog we encountered. When the vast rise loomed\nahead, between Latitudes 83\u00c2\u00b0 and 84\u00c2\u00b0, we knew we had reached Beardmore\nGlacier, the largest valley glacier in the world, and that the frozen\nsea was now giving place to a frowning and mountainous coast line.\n\nAt last we were truly entering the white, \u00c3\u00a6on-dead world of the\nultimate south. Even as we realized it we saw the peak of Mt. Nansen\nin the eastern distance, towering up to its height of almost fifteen\nthousand feet.\n\nThe successful establishment of the southern base above the glacier in\nLatitude 86\u00c2\u00b0 7\u00c2\u00b4, East Longitude 174\u00c2\u00b0 23\u00c2\u00b4, and the phenomenally rapid\nand effective borings and blastings made at various points reached by\nour sledge trips and short a\u00c3\u00abroplane flights, are matters of history;\nas is the arduous and triumphant ascent of Mt. Nansen by Pabodie and\ntwo of the graduate students\u00e2\u0080\u0094Gedney and Carroll\u00e2\u0080\u0094on December 13th to\n15th.\n\nWe were some eight thousand five hundred feet above sea-level. When\nexperimental drillings revealed solid ground only twelve feet down\nthrough the snow and ice at certain points, we made considerable use of\nthe small melting apparatus and sunk bores and performed dynamiting at\nmany places, where no previous explorer had ever thought of securing\nmineral specimens.\n\nThe pre-Cambrian granites and beacon sandstones thus obtained confirmed\nour belief that this plateau was homogeneous, with the great bulk of\nthe continent to the west, but somewhat different from the parts lying\neastward below South America\u00e2\u0080\u0094which we then thought to form a separate\nand smaller continent divided from the larger one by a frozen junction\nof Ross and Weddell Seas, though Byrd has since disproved the report.\n\nIn certain of the sandstones, dynamited and chiseled after boring\nrevealed their nature, we found some highly interesting fossil markings\nand fragments; notably ferns, seaweeds, trilobites, crinoids, and such\nmollusks as linguell\u00c3\u00a6 and gastropods\u00e2\u0080\u0094all of which seemed of real\nsignificance in connection with the region's primordial history. There\nwas also a queer triangular, striated marking, about a foot in greatest\ndiameter, which Lake pieced together from three fragments of slate\nbrought up from a deep-blasted aperture.\n\nThese fragments came from a point to the westward, near the Queen\nAlexandra Range; and Lake, as a biologist, seemed to find their curious\nmarking unusually puzzling and provocative, though to my geological eye\nit looked not unlike some of the ripple effects reasonably common in\nthe sedimentary rocks.\n\nSince slate is no more than a metamorphic formation into which a\nsedimentary stratum is pressed, and since the pressure itself produces\nodd distorting effects on any markings which may exist, I saw no reason\nfor extreme wonder over the striated depression.\n\nOn January 6, 1931, Lake, Pabodie, Daniels, all six of the students,\nfour mechanics, and myself flew directly over the south pole in two\nof the great planes, being forced down once by a sudden high wind,\nwhich, fortunately, did not develop into a typical storm. This was,\nas the papers have stated, one of several observation flights, during\nothers of which we tried to discern new topographical features in areas\nunreached by previous explorers.\n\nOur early flights were disappointing in this latter respect, though\nthey afforded us some magnificent examples of the richly fantastic and\ndeceptive mirages of the polar regions, of which our sea voyage had\ngiven us some brief foretastes.\n\nDistant mountains floated in the sky as enchanted cities, and often the\nwhole white world would dissolve into a gold, silver, and scarlet land\nof Dunsanian dreams and adventurous expectancy under the magic of the\nlow midnight sun.\n\nOn cloudy days we had considerable trouble in flying, owing to the\ntendency of snowy earth and sky to merge into one mystical opalescent\nvoid with no visible horizon to mark the junction of the two.\n\nAt length we resolved to carry out our original plan of flying five\nhundred miles eastward with all four exploring planes and establishing\na fresh sub-base at a point which would probably be on the smaller\ncontinental division, as we mistakenly conceived it. Geological\nspecimens obtained there would be desirable for purposes of comparison.\n\nOur health so far had remained excellent\u00e2\u0080\u0094lime juice well offsetting\nthe steady diet of tinned and salted food, and temperatures generally\nabove zero enabling us to do without our thickest furs.\n\nIt was now midsummer, and with haste and care we might be able to\nconclude work by March and avoid a tedious wintering through the long\nantarctic night. Several savage windstorms had burst upon us from the\nwest, but we had escaped damage through the skill of Atwood in devising\nrudimentary a\u00c3\u00abroplane shelters and windbreaks of heavy snow blocks, and\nin reinforcing the principal camp buildings with snow. Our good luck\nand efficiency had indeed been almost uncanny.\n\nThe outside world knew, of course, of our program, and was told also\nof Lake's strange and dogged insistence on a westward\u00e2\u0080\u0094or rather,\nnorthwestward\u00e2\u0080\u0094prospecting trip before our radical shift to the new\nbase.\n\nIt seems that he had pondered a great deal and with alarmingly radical\ndaring over that triangular striated marking in the slate; reading into\nit certain contradictions in nature and geological period which whetted\nhis curiosity to the utmost, and made him avid to sink more borings\nand blastings in the west-stretching formation to which the exhumed\nfragments evidently belonged.\n\nHe was strangely convinced that the marking was the print of some\nbulky, unknown, and radically unclassifiable organism of considerably\nadvanced evolution, notwithstanding that the rock which bore it was of\nso vastly ancient a date\u00e2\u0080\u0094Cambrian if not actually pre-Cambrian\u00e2\u0080\u0094as to\npreclude the probable existence not only of all highly evolved life,\nbut of any life at all above the unicellular or at most the trilobite\nstage. These fragments, with their odd marking, must have been five\nhundred million to a thousand million years old.\n\nII.\n\nPopular imagination, I judge, responded actively to our wireless\nbulletins of Lake's start northwestward into regions never trodden\nby human foot or penetrated by human imagination, though we did not\nmention his wild hopes of revolutionizing the entire sciences of\nbiology and geology.\n\nHis preliminary sledging and boring journey of January 11th to 18th\nwith Pabodie and five others\u00e2\u0080\u0094marred by the loss of two dogs in an\nupset when crossing one of the great pressure ridges in the ice\u00e2\u0080\u0094had\nbrought up more and more of the Arch\u00c3\u00a6an slate; and even I was\ninterested by the singular profusion of evident fossil markings in that\nunbelievably ancient stratum.\n\nThese markings, however, were of very primitive life forms involving\nno great paradox except that any life forms should occur in rock as\ndefinitely pre-Cambrian as this seemed to be; hence I still failed to\nsee the good sense of Lake's demand for an interlude in our time-saving\nprogram\u00e2\u0080\u0094an interlude requiring the use of all four planes, many men,\nand the whole of the expedition's mechanical apparatus.\n\nI did not, in the end, veto the plan, though I decided not to accompany\nthe northwestward party despite Lake's plea for my geological advice.\nWhile they were gone, I would remain at the base with Pabodie and five\nmen and work out final plans for the eastward shift. In preparation for\nthis transfer, one of the planes had begun to move up a good gasoline\nsupply from McMurdo Sound; but this could wait temporarily. I kept\nwith me one sledge and nine dogs, since it is unwise to be at any time\nwithout possible transportation in an utterly tenantless world of\n\u00c3\u00a6on-long death.\n\nLake's subexpedition into the unknown, as every one will recall, sent\nout its own reports from the short-wave transmitters on the planes;\nthese being simultaneously picked up by our apparatus at the southern\nbase and by the Arkham at McMurdo Sound, whence they were relayed to\nthe outside world on wave lengths up to fifty meters.\n\nThe start was made January 22nd at 4 a.m.; and the first wireless\nmessage we received came only two hours later, when Lake spoke of\ndescending and starting a small-scale ice-melting and bore at a point\nsome three hundred miles away from us. Six hours after that a second\nand very excited message told of the frantic, beaverlike work whereby a\nshallow shaft had been sunk and blasted, culminating in the discovery\nof slate fragments with several markings approximately like the one\nwhich had caused the original puzzlement.\n\nThree hours later a brief bulletin announced the resumption of the\nflight in the teeth of a raw and piercing gale; and when I dispatched\na message of protest against further hazards, Lake replied curtly that\nhis new specimens made any hazard worth taking.\n\nI saw that his excitement had reached the point of mutiny, and that I\ncould do nothing to check this headlong risk of the whole expedition's\nsuccess; but it was appalling to think of his plunging deeper and\ndeeper into that treacherous and sinister white immensity of tempests\nand unfathomed mysteries which stretched off for some fifteen hundred\nmiles to the half-known, half-suspected coast line of Queen Mary and\nKnox Lands.\n\nThen, in about an hour and a half more, came that doubly excited\nmessage from Lake's moving plane, which almost reversed my sentiments\nand made me wish I had accompanied the party:\n\n\"10:05 p.m. On the wing. After snowstorm, have spied mountain range\nahead higher than any hitherto seen. May equal Himalayas, allowing\nfor height of plateau. Probable Latitude 76\u00c2\u00b0 15\u00c2\u00b4, Longitude 113\u00c2\u00b0 10\u00c2\u00b4\nE. Reaches far as can see to right and left. Suspicion of two smoking\ncones. All peaks black and bare of snow. Gale blowing off them impedes\nnavigation.\"\n\nAfter that Pabodie, the men, and I hung breathlessly over the receiver.\nThought of this titanic mountain rampart seven hundred miles away\ninflamed our deepest sense of adventure; and we rejoiced that our\nexpedition, if not ourselves personally, had been its discoverers. In\nhalf an hour Lake called us again:\n\n\"Moulton's plane forced down on plateau in foothills, but nobody hurt\nand perhaps can repair. Shall transfer essentials to other three for\nreturn or further moves if necessary, but no more heavy plane travel\nneeded just now. Mountains surpass anything in imagination. Am going\nup scouting in Carroll's plane, with all weight out.\n\n\"You can't imagine anything like this. Highest peaks must go over\nthirty-five thousand feet. Everest out of the running, Atwood to work\nout height with theodolite while Carroll and I go up. Probably wrong\nabout cones, for formations look stratified. Possibly pre-Cambrian\nslate with other strata mixed in. Queer sky line effects\u00e2\u0080\u0094regular\nsections of cubes clinging to highest peaks. Whole thing marvelous in\nred-gold light of low sun. Like land of mystery in a dream or gateway\nto forbidden world of untrodden wonder. Wish you were here to study.\"\n\nThough it was technically sleeping time, not one of us listeners\nthought for a moment of retiring. It must have been a good deal\nthe same at McMurdo Sound, where the supply cache and the Arkham were also getting the messages; for Captain Douglas gave out a call\ncongratulating everybody on the important find, and Sherman, the cache\noperator, seconded his sentiments. We were sorry, of course, about the\ndamaged a\u00c3\u00abroplane, but hoped it could be easily mended. Then, at eleven\np.m., came another call from Lake:\n\n\"Up with Carroll over highest foothills. Don't dare try really tall\npeaks in present weather, but shall later. Frightful work climbing,\nand hard going at this altitude, but worth it. Great range fairly\nsolid, hence can't get any glimpses beyond. Main summits exceed\nHimalayas, and very queer. Range looks like pre-Cambrian slate, with\nplain signs of many other upheaved strata. Was wrong about volcanism.\nGoes farther in either direction than we can see. Swept clear of snow\nabove about twenty-one thousand feet.\n\n\"Odd formations on slopes of highest mountains. Great low square\nblocks with exactly vertical sides, and rectangular lines of low,\nvertical ramparts, like the old Asian castles clinging to steep\nmountains in Roerich's paintings. Impressive from distance. Flew close\nto some, and Carroll thought they were formed of smaller separate\npieces, but that is probably weathering. Most edges crumbled and\nrounded off as if exposed to storms and climate changes for millions\nof years.\n\n\"Parts, especially upper parts, seem to be of lighter-colored\nrock than any visible strata on slopes proper, hence an evidently\ncrystalline origin. Close flying shows many cave mouths, some\nunusually regular in outline, square or semicircular. You must come\nand investigate. Think I saw rampart squarely on top of one peak.\nHeight seems about thirty thousand to thirty-five thousand feet. Am up\ntwenty-one thousand five hundred myself, in devilish, gnawing cold.\nWind whistles and pipes through passes and in and out of caves, but no\nflying danger so far.\"\n\nFrom then on for another half hour Lake kept up a running fire of\ncomment, and expressed his intention of climbing some of the peaks on\nfoot. I replied that I would join him as soon as he could send a plane,\nand that Pabodie and I would work out the best gasoline plan\u00e2\u0080\u0094just\nwhere and how to concentrate our supply in view of the expedition's\naltered character.\n\nObviously, Lake's boring operations, as well as his a\u00c3\u00abroplane\nactivities, would need a great deal delivered at the new base which\nhe was to establish at the foot of the mountains; and it was possible\nthat the eastward flight might not be made, after all, this season. In\nconnection with this business I called Captain Douglas and asked him to\nget as much as possible out of the ships and up the barrier with the\nsingle dog team we had left there. A direct route across the unknown\nregion between Lake and McMurdo Sound was what we really ought to\nestablish.\n\nLake called me later to say that he had decided to let the camp stay\nwhere Moulton's plane had been forced down, and where repairs had\nalready progressed somewhat. The ice sheet was very thin, with dark\nground here and there visible, and he would sink some borings and\nblasts at that very point before making any sledge trips or climbing\nexpeditions.\n\nHe spoke of the ineffable majesty of the whole scene, and the queer\nstate of his sensations at being in the lee of vast, silent pinnacles,\nwhose ranks shot up like a wall reaching the sky at the world's rim.\n\nIt was a queer state of sensations\u00e2\u0080\u0094being in the lee of vast, silent pinnacles, where ranks shot up like a wall reaching the sky at the world's rim.\n\nAtwood's theodolite observations had placed the height of the five\ntallest peaks at from thirty thousand to thirty-four thousand feet.\n\nThe windswept nature of the terrain clearly disturbed Lake, for it\nargued the occasional existence of prodigious gales, violent beyond\nanything we had so far encountered. His camp lay a little more than\nfive miles from where the higher foothills rose abruptly.\n\nI could almost trace a note of subconscious alarm in his words\u00e2\u0080\u0094flashed\nacross a glacial void of seven hundred miles\u00e2\u0080\u0094as he urged that we all\nhasten with the matter and get the strange, new region disposed of as\nsoon as possible. He was about to rest now, after a continuous day's\nwork of almost unparalleled speed, strenuousness, and results.\n\nIn the morning I had a three-cornered wireless talk with Lake and\nCaptain Douglas at their widely separated bases. It was agreed that one\nof Lake's planes would come to my base for Pabodie, the five men, and\nmyself, as well as for all the fuel it could carry. The rest of the\nfuel question, depending on our decision about an easterly trip, could\nwait for a few days, since Lake had enough for immediate camp heat and\nborings.\n\nEventually the old southern base ought to be restocked, but if we\npostponed the easterly trip we would not use it till the next summer,\nand, meanwhile, Lake must send a plane to explore a direct route\nbetween his new mountains and McMurdo Sound.\n\nPabodie and I prepared to close our base for a short or long period, as\nthe case might be. If we wintered in the antarctic we would probably\nfly straight from Lake's base to the Arkham without returning to\nthis spot. Some of our conical tents had already been reinforced by\nblocks of hard snow, and now we decided to complete the job of making a\npermanent village. Owing to a very liberal tent supply, Lake had with\nhim all that his base would need, even after our arrival. I wirelessed\nthat Pabodie and I would be ready for the northwestward move after one\nday's work and one night's rest.\n\nOur labors, however, were not very steady after four p.m., for about\nthat time Lake began sending in the most extraordinary and excited\nmessages. His working day had started unpropitiously, since an\na\u00c3\u00abroplane survey of the nearly exposed rock surfaces showed an entire\nabsence of those Arch\u00c3\u00a6an and primordial strata for which he was\nlooking, and which formed so great a part of the colossal peaks that\nloomed up at a tantalizing distance from the camp.\n\nMost of the rocks glimpsed were apparently Jurassic and Comanchean\nsandstones and Permian and Triassic schists, with now and then a glossy\nblack outcropping suggesting a hard and slaty coal.\n\nThis rather discouraged Lake, whose plans all hinged on unearthing\nspecimens more than five hundred million years older. It was clear\nto him that in order to recover the Arch\u00c3\u00a6an slate vein in which he\nhad found the odd markings, he would have to make a long sledge trip\nfrom these foothills to the steep slopes of the gigantic mountains\nthemselves.\n\nHe had resolved, nevertheless, to do some local boring as part of the\nexpedition's general program; hence, he set up the drill and put five\nmen to work with it while the rest finished settling the camp and\nrepairing the damaged a\u00c3\u00abroplane. The softest visible rock\u00e2\u0080\u0094a sandstone\nabout a quarter of a mile from the camp\u00e2\u0080\u0094had been chosen for the\nfirst sampling; and the drill made excellent progress without much\nsupplementary blasting.\n\nIt was about three hours afterward, following the first really heavy\nblast of the operation, that the shouting of the drill crew was heard;\nand that young Gedney\u00e2\u0080\u0094the acting foreman\u00e2\u0080\u0094rushed into the camp with\nthe startling news.\n\nThey had struck a cave. Early in the boring the sandstone had given\nplace to a vein of Comanchean limestone, full of minute fossil\ncephalopods, corals, echini, and spirifera, and with occasional\nsuggestions of siliceous sponges and marine vertebrate bones\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\nlatter probably of teliosts, sharks, and ganoids.\n\nThis, in itself, was important enough, as affording the first\nvertebrate fossils the expedition had yet secured; but when shortly\nafterward the drill head dropped through the stratum into apparent\nvacancy, a wholly new and doubly intense wave of excitement spread\namong the excavators.\n\nA good-sized blast had laid open the subterrane secret; and now,\nthrough a jagged aperture perhaps five feet across and three feet\nthick, there yawned before the avid searchers a section of shallow\nlimestone hollowing worn more than fifty million years ago by the\ntrickling ground waters of a bygone tropic world.\n\nThe hollowed layer was not more than seven or eight feet deep, but\nextended off indefinitely in all directions and had a fresh, slightly\nmoving air which suggested its membership in an extensive subterranean\nsystem. Its roof and floor were abundantly equipped with large\nstalactites and stalagmites, some of which met in columnar form.\n\nBut important above all else was the vast deposit of shells and bones,\nwhich in places nearly choked the passage. Washed down from unknown\njungles of Mesozoic tree ferns and fungi, and forests of Tertiary\ncycads, fan palms, and primitive angiosperms, this osseous medley\ncontained representatives of more Cretaceous, Eocene, and other\nanimal species than the greatest pal\u00c3\u00a6ontologist could have counted or\nclassified in a year. Mollusks, crustacean armor, fishes, amphibians,\nreptiles, birds, and early mammals\u00e2\u0080\u0094great and small, known and unknown.\n\nNo wonder Gedney ran back to the camp shouting, and no wonder every one\nelse dropped work and rushed headlong through the biting cold to where\nthe tall derrick marked a new-found gateway to secrets of inner earth\nand vanished \u00c3\u00a6ons.\n\nWhen Lake had satisfied the first keen edge of his curiosity he\nscribbled a message in his notebook and had young Moulton run back to\nthe camp to dispatch it by wireless.\n\nThis was my first word of the discovery, and it told of the\nidentification of early shells, bones of ganoids and placoderms,\nremnants of labyrinthodonta and thecoiidea, great mosasaur skull\nfragments, dinosaur vertebr\u00c3\u00a6 and armor plates, pterodactyl teeth and\nwing bones, Archaeopteryx d\u00c3\u00a9bris, Miocene sharks' teeth, primitive\nbird skulls, and other bones of archaic mammals such as Pal\u00c3\u00a6otheres,\nXiphodons, Eohippi, Oreodons, and Titanotheriid\u00c3\u00a6.\n\nThere was nothing as recent as a mastodon, elephant, true camel, deer,\nor bovine animal; hence Lake concluded that the last deposits had\noccurred during the Oligocene Age, and that the hollowed stratum had\nlain in its present dried, dead, and inaccessible state for at least\nthirty million years.\n\nOn the other hand, the prevalence of very early life forms was singular\nin the highest degree. Though the limestone formation was, on the\nevidence of such typical imbedded fossils as ventriculites, positively\nand unmistakably Comanchean and not a particle earlier; the free\nfragments in the hollow space included a surprising proportion from\norganisms hitherto considered as peculiar to far older periods\u00e2\u0080\u0094even\nrudimentary fishes, mollusks, and corals as remote as the Silurian or\nOrdovician.\n\nThe inevitable inference was that in this part of the world there had\nbeen a remarkable and unique degree of continuity between the life of\nover three hundred million years ago and that of only thirty million\nyears ago. How far this continuity had extended beyond the Oligocene\nAge when the cavern was closed was of course past all speculation.\n\nIn any event, the coming of the frightful ice in the Pleistocene some\nfive hundred thousand years ago\u00e2\u0080\u0094a mere yesterday as compared with the\nage of this cavity\u00e2\u0080\u0094must have put an end to any of the primal forms\nwhich had locally managed to outlive their common terms.\n\nLake was not content to let his first message stand, but had another\nbulletin written and dispatched across the snow to the camp before\nMoulton could get back. After that Moulton stayed at the wireless in\none of the planes, transmitting to me\u00e2\u0080\u0094and to the Arkham for relaying\nto the outside world\u00e2\u0080\u0094the frequent postscripts which Lake sent him by a\nsuccession of messengers.\n\nThose who followed the newspapers will remember the excitement created\namong men of science by that afternoon's reports\u00e2\u0080\u0094reports which have\nfinally led, after all these years, to the organization of that very\nStarkweather-Moore Expedition which I am so anxious to dissuade from\nits purposes. I had better give the messages literally as Lake sent\nthem, and as our base operator McTighe translated them from his pencil\nshorthand:\n\nFowler makes discovery of highest importance in sandstone and\nlimestone fragments from blasts. Several distinct triangular striated\nprints like those in arch\u00c3\u00a6an slate, proving that source survived from\nover six hundred million years ago to Comanchean times without more\nthan moderate morphological changes and decrease in average size.\nComanchean prints apparently more primitive or decadent, if anything,\nthan older ones. Emphasize importance of discovery in press. Will\nmean to biology what Einstein has meant to mathematics and physics.\nJoins up with my previous work and amplifies conclusions.\n\nAppears to indicate, as I suspected, that earth has seen whole cycle\nor cycles of organic life before known one that begins with Arch\u00c3\u00a6ozoic\ncells. Was evolved and specialized not later than a thousand million\nyears ago, when planet was young and recently uninhabitable for any\nlife forms of normal protoplasmic structure. Question arises when,\nwhere, and how development took place.\n\nLater. Examining certain skeletal fragments of large land and marine\nsaurians and primitive mammals, find singular local wounds or injuries\nto bony structure not attributable to any known predatory or\ncarnivorous animal of any period. Of two sorts\u00e2\u0080\u0094straight, penetrant\nbores, and apparently hacking incisions. One or two cases of cleanly\nsevered bones. Not many specimens affected. Am sending to camp for\nelectric torches. Will extend search area underground by hacking away\nstalactites.\n\nStill later. Have found peculiar soapstone fragment about six inches\nacross and an inch and a half thick, wholly unlike any visible local\nformation\u00e2\u0080\u0094greenish, but no evidences to place its period. Has curious\nsmoothness and regularity. Shaped like five-pointed star with tips\nbroken off, and signs of other cleavage at inward angles and in center\nof surface. Small, smooth depression in center of unbroken surface.\nArouses much curiosity as to source and weathering. Probably some\nfreak of water action. Carroll, with magnifier, thinks he can make\nout additional markings of geologic significance. Groups of tiny dots\nin regular patterns. Dogs growing uneasy as we work, and seem to hate\nthis soapstone. Must see if it has any peculiar odor. Will report\nagain when Mills gets back with light and we start on underground area.\n\n10:15 p.m. Important discovery. Orrendorf and Watkins, working\nunderground at 9:45 with light, found monstrous barrel-shaped fossil\nof wholly unknown nature; probably vegetable unless overgrown specimen\nof unknown marine radiata. Tissue evidently preserved by mineral\nsalts. Tough as leather, but astonishing flexibility retained in\nplaces. Marks of broken-off parts at ends and around sides. Six feet\nend to end, three and five tenths feet central diameter, tapering to\none foot at each end. Like a barrel with five bulging ridges in place\nof staves. Lateral breakages, as of thinnish stalks, are at equator\nin middle of these ridges. In furrows between ridges are curious\ngrowths\u00e2\u0080\u0094combs or wings that fold up and spread out like fans. All\ngreatly damaged but one, which gives almost seven-foot wing spread.\nArrangement reminds one of certain monsters of primal myth, especially\nfabled Elder Things in Necronomicon .\n\nThese wings seem to be membranous, stretched on framework of glandular\ntubing. Apparent minute orifices in frame tubing at wing tips. Ends\nof body shriveled, giving no clue to interior or to what has been\nbroken off there. Must dissect when we get back to camp. Can't decide\nwhether vegetable or animal. Many features obviously of almost\nincredible primitiveness. Have set all hands cutting stalactites and\nlooking for further specimens. Additional scarred bones found, but\nthese must wait. Having trouble with dogs. They can't endure the new\nspecimen, and would probably tear it to pieces if we didn't keep it at\na distance from them.\n\n11:30 p.m. Attention, Dyer, Pabodie, Douglas. Matter of highest\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\nmight say transcendent\u00e2\u0080\u0094importance. Arkham must relay to Kingsport\nHead Station at once. Strange barrel growth is the arch\u00c3\u00a6an thing that\nleft prints in rocks. Mills, Boudreau, and Fowler discover cluster of\nthirteen more at underground point forty feet from aperture. Mixed\nwith curiously rounded and configured soapstone fragments smaller than\none previously found\u00e2\u0080\u0094star-shaped, but no marks of breakage except at\nsome of the points.\n\nOf organic specimens, eight apparently perfect, with all appendages.\nHave brought all to surface, leading off dogs to distance. They cannot\nstand the things. Give close attention to description and repeat back\nfor accuracy. Papers must get this right.\n\nObjects are eight feet long all over. Six-foot, five-ridged barrel\ntorso three and five tenths feet central diameter, one foot end\ndiameters. Dark gray, flexible, and infinitely tough. Seven-foot\nmembranous wings of same color, found folded, spread out of furrows\nbetween ridges. Wing framework tubular or glandular, or lighter gray,\nwith orifices at wing tips. Spread wings have serrated edge. Around\nequator, one at central apex of each of the five vertical, stavelike\nridges, are five systems of light-gray flexible arms or tentacles\nfound tightly folded to torso but expansible to maximum length of over\nthree feet. Like arms of primitive crinoid. Single stalks three inches\ndiameter branch after six inches into five substalks, each of which\nbranches after eight inches into five small, tapering tentacles or\ntendrils, giving each stalk a total of twenty-five tentacles.\n\nAt top of torso blunt, bulbous neck of lighter gray, with gill-like\nsuggestions, holds yellowish five-pointed starfish-shaped apparent\nhead covered with three-inch wiry cilia of various prismatic colors.\n\nHead thick and puffy, about two feet point to point, with three-inch\nflexible yellowish tubes projecting from each point. Slit in exact\ncenter of top probably breathing aperture. At end of each tube is\nspherical expansion where yellowish membrane rolls back on handling to\nreveal glassy, red-irised globe, evidently an eye.\n\nFive slightly longer reddish tubes start from inner angles of\nstarfish-shaped head and end in saclike swellings of same color\nwhich, upon pressure, open to bell-shaped orifices two inches maximum\ndiameter and lined with sharp, white tooth-like projections\u00e2\u0080\u0094probable\nmouths. All these tubes, cilia, and points of starfish head, found\nfolded tightly down; tubes and points clinging to bulbous neck and\ntorso. Flexibility surprising despite vast toughness.\n\nAt bottom of torso, rough but dissimilarly functioning counterparts of\nhead arrangements exist. Bulbous light-gray pseudoneck, without gill\nsuggestions, holds greenish five-pointed starfish arrangement.\n\nTough, muscular arms four feet long and tapering from seven inches\ndiameter at base to about two and five tenths at point. To each point\nis attached small end of a greenish five-veined membranous triangle\neight inches long and six wide at farther end. This is the paddle,\nfin, or pseudofoot which had made prints in rocks from a thousand\nmillion to fifty or sixty million years old.\n\nFrom inner angles of starfish arrangement project two-foot reddish\ntubes tapering from three inches diameter at base to one at tip.\nOrifices at tips. All these parts infinitely tough and leathery,\nbut extremely flexible. Four-foot arms with paddles undoubtedly\nused for locomotion of some sort, marine or otherwise. When moved,\ndisplay suggestions of exaggerated muscularity. As found, all\nthese projections tightly folded over pseudoneck and end of torso,\ncorresponding to projections at other end.\n\nCannot yet assign positively to animal or vegetable kingdom, but odds\nnow favor animal. Probably represents incredibly advanced evolution\nof radiata without loss of certain primitive features. Echinoderm\nresemblances unmistakable despite local contradictory evidences.\n\nWing structure puzzles in view of probable marine habitat, but may\nhave use in water navigation. Symmetry is curiously vegetablelike,\nsuggesting vegetable's essential up-and-down structure rather than\nanimal's fore-and-aft structure. Fabulously early date of evolution,\npreceding even simplest arch\u00c3\u00a6an Protozoa hitherto known, baffles all\nconjecture as to origin.\n\nComplete specimens have such uncanny resemblance to certain creatures\nof primal myth that suggestion of ancient existence outside antarctic\nbecomes inevitable. Dyer and Pabodie have read Necronomicon and\nseen Clark Ashton Smith's nightmare paintings based on text, and will\nunderstand when I speak of Elder Things supposed to have created all\nearth life as jest or mistake. Students have always thought conception\nformed from morbid imaginative treatment of very ancient tropical\nradiata. Also like prehistoric folklore things Wilmarth has spoken\nof\u00e2\u0080\u0094Cthulhu cult appendages, etc.\n\nVast field of study opened. Deposits probably of late Cretaceous\nor early Eocene period, judging from associated specimens. Massive\nstalagmites deposited above them. Hard work hewing out, but toughness\nprevented damage. State of preservation miraculous, evidently owing to\nlimestone action. No more found so far, but will resume search later.\nJob now to get fourteen huge specimens to camp without dogs, which\nbark furiously and can't be trusted near them.\n\nWith nine men\u00e2\u0080\u0094three left to guard the dogs\u00e2\u0080\u0094we ought to manage the\nthree sledges fairly well, though wind is bad. Must establish plane\ncommunication with McMurdo Sound and begin shipping material. But\nI've got to dissect one of these things before we take any rest. Wish\nI had a real laboratory here. Dyer better kick himself for having\ntried to stop my westward trip. First the world's greatest mountains,\nand then this. If this last isn't the high spot of the expedition, I\ndon't know what is. We're made scientifically. Congrats, Pabodie, on\nthe drill that opened up the cave. Now will Arkham please repeat\ndescription?\n\n\" I've got to dissect one of these things before \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\n\" First the world's greatest mountains\u00e2\u0080\u0094then this! \"\n\nThe sensations of Pabodie and myself at receipt of this report were\nalmost beyond description, nor were our companions much behind us in\nenthusiasm. McTighe, who had hastily translated a few high spots as\nthey came from the droning receiving set, wrote out the entire message\nfrom his shorthand version, as soon as Lake's operator signed off.\n\nAll appreciated the epoch-making significance of the discovery, and\nI sent Lake congratulations as soon as the Arkham's operator had\nrepeated back the descriptive parts as requested; and my example was\nfollowed by Sherman from his station at the McMurdo Sound supply cache,\nas well as by Captain Douglas of the Arkham .\n\nLater, as head of the expedition, I added some remarks to be relayed\nthrough the Arkham to the outside world. Of course, rest was an\nabsurd thought amidst this excitement; and my only wish was to get to\nLake's camp as quickly as I could. It disappointed me when he sent word\nthat a rising mountain gale made early a\u00c3\u00abrial travel impossible.\n\nBut within an hour and a half interest again rose to banish\ndisappointment. Lake, sending more messages, told of the completely\nsuccessful transportation of the fourteen great specimens to the camp.\nIt had been a hard pull, for the things were surprisingly heavy; but\nnine men had accomplished it very neatly. Now some of the party were\nhurriedly building a snow corral at a safe distance from the camp, to\nwhich the dogs could be brought for greater convenience in feeding. The\nspecimens were laid out on the hard snow near the camp, save for one on\nwhich Lake was making crude attempts at dissection.\n\nThis dissection seemed to be a greater task than had been expected,\nfor, despite the heat of a gasoline stove in the newly raised\nlaboratory tent, the deceptively flexible tissues of the chosen\nspecimen\u00e2\u0080\u0094a powerful and intact one\u00e2\u0080\u0094lost nothing of their more than\nleathery toughness. Lake was puzzled as to how he might make the\nrequisite incisions without violence destructive enough to upset all\nthe structural niceties he was looking for.\n\nHe had, it is true, seven more perfect specimens; but these were too\nfew to use up recklessly unless the cave might later yield an unlimited\nsupply. Accordingly, he removed the specimen and dragged in one which,\nthough having remnants of the starfish arrangements at both ends, was\nbadly crushed and partly disrupted along one of the great torso furrows.\n\nResults, quickly reported over the wireless, were baffling and\nprovocative indeed. Nothing like delicacy or accuracy was possible with\ninstruments hardly able to cut the anomalous tissue, but the little\nthat was achieved left us all awed and bewildered.\n\nExisting biology would have to be wholly revised, for this thing was no\nproduct of any cell growth science knows about. There had been scarcely\nany mineral replacement, and despite an age of perhaps forty million\nyears the internal organs were wholly intact.\n\nThe leathery, undeteriorative, and almost indestructible quality was an\ninherent attribute of the thing's form of organization, and pertained\nto some paleocene cycle of invertebrate evolution utterly beyond our\npowers of speculation.\n\nAt first all that Lake found was dry, but as the heated tent produced\nits thawing effect, organic moisture of pungent and offensive odor\nwas encountered toward the thing's uninjured side. It was not blood,\nbut a thick, dark-green fluid apparently answering the same purpose.\nBy the time Lake reached this stage all thirty-seven dogs had been\nbrought to the still uncompleted corral near the camp, and even at that\ndistance set up a savage barking and show of restlessness at the acrid,\ndiffusive smell.\n\nFar from helping to place the strange entity, this provisional\ndissection merely deepened its mystery. All guesses about its external\nmembers had been correct, and on the evidence of these one could hardly\nhesitate to call the thing animal, but internal inspection brought up\nso many vegetable evidences that Lake was left hopelessly at sea. It\nhad digestion and circulation, and eliminated waste matter through the\nreddish tubes of its starfish-shaped base.\n\nCursorily, one would say that its respiratory apparatus handled oxygen\nrather than carbon dioxide; and there were odd evidences of air-storage\nchambers and methods of shifting respiration from the external orifice\nto at least two other fully developed breathing systems\u00e2\u0080\u0094gills and\npores.\n\nClearly, it was amphibian and probably adapted to long airless\nhibernation periods as well. Vocal organs seemed present in connection\nwith the main respiratory system, but they presented anomalies beyond\nimmediate solution. Articulate speech, in the sense of syllable\nutterance, seemed barely conceivable, but musical piping notes covering\na wide range were highly probable. The muscular system was almost\npre-naturally developed.\n\nThe nervous system was so complex and highly developed as to leave Lake\naghast. Though excessively primitive and archaic in some respects, the\nthing had a set of gangliar centers and connectives arguing the very\nextremes of specialized development.\n\nIts five-lobed brain was surprisingly advanced, and there were signs of\na sensory equipment, served in part through the wiry cilia of the head,\ninvolving factors alien to any other terrestrial organism. Probably it\nhad more than five senses, so that its habits could not be predicted\nfrom any existing analogy.\n\nIt must, Lake thought, have been a creature of keen sensitiveness and\ndelicately differentiated functions in its primal world\u00e2\u0080\u0094much like the\nants and bees of to-day. It reproduced like the vegetable cryptogams,\nespecially the pteridophyta; having spore cases at the tips of the\nwings and evidently developing from a thallus or prothallus.\n\nBut to give it a name at this stage was mere folly. It looked like a\nradiate, but was clearly something more. It was partly vegetable, but\nhad three fourths of the essentials of animal structure. That it was\nmarine in origin, its symmetrical contour and certain other attributes\nclearly indicated; yet one could not be exact as to the limit of its\nlater adaptations.\n\nThe wings, after all, held a persistent suggestion of the a\u00c3\u00abrial.\nHow it could have undergone its tremendously complex evolution on a\nnew-born earth in time to leave prints in arch\u00c3\u00a6an rocks was so far\nbeyond conception as to make Lake whimsically recall the primal myths\nabout Great Old Ones who filtered down from the stars and concocted\nearth life as a joke or mistake; and the wild tales of cosmic hill\nthings from outside told by a folklorist colleague in Miskatonic's\nEnglish department.\n\nNaturally, he considered the possibility of the pre-Cambrian prints\nhaving been made by a less evolved ancestor of the present specimens,\nbut quickly rejected this too-facile theory upon considering the\nadvanced structural qualities of the older fossils. If anything, the\nlater contours showed decadence rather than higher evolution.\n\nThe size of the pseudofeet had decreased, and the whole morphology\nseemed coarsened and simplified. Moreover, the nerves and organs,\njust examined, held singular suggestions of retrogression from forms\nstill more complex. Atrophied and vestigial parts were surprisingly\nprevalent. Altogether, little could be said to have been solved; and\nLake fell back on mythology for a provisional name\u00e2\u0080\u0094jocosely dubbing\nhis finds \"The Elder Ones.\"\n\nAt about two-thirty a.m., having decided to postpone further work and\nget a little rest, he covered the dissected organism with a tarpaulin,\nemerged from the laboratory tent, and studied the intact specimens with\nrenewed interest.\n\nThe ceaseless antarctic sun had begun to limber up their tissues a\ntrifle, so that the head points and tubes of two or three showed\nsigns of unfolding; but Lake did not believe there was any danger of\nimmediate decomposition in the almost subzero air. He did, however,\nmove all the undissected specimens closer together and throw a spare\ntent over them in order to keep off the direct solar rays. That\nwould also help to keep their possible scent away from the dogs,\nwhose hostile unrest was really becoming a problem, even at their\nsubstantial distance and behind the higher and higher snow walls, which\nan increased quota of the men were hastening to raise around their\nquarters.\n\nHe had to weight down the corners of the tent cloth with heavy blocks\nof snow to hold it in place amidst the rising gale, for the titan\nmountains seemed about to deliver some gravely severe blasts. Early\napprehensions about sudden antarctic winds were revived, and under\nAtwood's supervision precautions were taken to bank the tents, new dog\ncorral, and crude a\u00c3\u00abroplane shelters with snow, on the mountainward\nside. These latter shelters, begun with hard snow blocks during odd\nmoments, were by no means as high as they should have been; and Lake\nfinally detached all hands from other tasks to work on them.\n\nIt was after four when Lake at last prepared to sign off and advised\nus all to share the rest period his outfit would take when the shelter\nwalls were a little higher. He held some friendly chat with Pabodie\nover the ether, and repeated his praise of the really marvelous drills\nthat had helped him make his discovery. Atwood also sent greetings and\npraises.\n\nI gave Lake a warm word of congratulation, owning up that he was right\nabout the western trip, and we all agreed to get in touch by wireless\nat ten in the morning. If the gale was then over, Lake would send a\nplane for the party at my base. Just before retiring I dispatched a\nfinal message to the Arkham , with instructions about toning down the\nday's news for the outside world, since the full details seemed radical\nenough to rouse a wave of incredulity until further substantiated.\n\nIII.\n\nNone of us, I imagine, slept very heavily or continuously that morning.\nBoth the excitement of Lake's discovery and the mounting fury of the\nwind were against such a thing. So savage was the blast even where we\nwere, that we could not help wondering how much worse it was at Lake's\ncamp, directly under the vast unknown peaks that bred and delivered it.\n\nMcTighe was awake at ten o'clock and tried to get Lake on the wireless,\nas agreed, but some electrical condition in the disturbed air to the\nwestward seemed to prevent communication. We did, however, get the Arkham , and Douglas told me that he had likewise been vainly trying\nto reach Lake. He had not known about the wind, for very little was\nblowing at McMurdo Sound, despite its persistent rage where we were.\n\nThroughout the day we all listened anxiously and tried to get Lake at\nintervals, but invariably without results. About noon a positive frenzy\nof wind stampeded out of the west, causing us to fear for the safety of\nour camp; but it eventually died down, with only a moderate relapse at\ntwo p.m.\n\nAfter three o'clock it was very quiet, and we redoubled our efforts to\nget Lake. Reflecting that he had four planes, each provided with an\nexcellent short-wave outfit, we could not imagine any ordinary accident\ncapable of crippling all his wireless equipment at once. Nevertheless,\nthe stony silence continued, and when we thought of the delirious force\nthe wind must have had in his locality we could not help making the\nmost direful conjectures.\n\nBy six o'clock our fears had become intense and definite, and after a\nwireless consultation with Douglas and Thorfinnssen I resolved to take\nsteps toward investigation. The fifth a\u00c3\u00abroplane, which we had left\nat the McMurdo Sound supply cache with Sherman and two sailors, was\nin good shape and ready for instant use, and it seemed that the very\nemergency for which it had been saved was now upon us.\n\nI got Sherman by wireless and ordered him to join me with the plane\nand the two sailors at the southern base as quickly as possible, the\nair conditions being apparently highly favorable. We then talked over\nthe personnel of the coming investigation party, and decided that we\nwould include all hands, together with the sledge and dogs which I\nhad kept with me. Even so great a load would not be too much for one\nof the huge planes built to our special orders for heavy machinery\ntransportation. At intervals I still tried to reach Lake with the\nwireless, but all to no purpose.\n\nSherman, with the sailors Gunnarsson and Larsen, took off at seven\nthirty; and reported a quiet flight from several points on the wing.\nThey arrived at our base at midnight, and all hands at once discussed\nthe next move. It was risky business sailing over the antarctic in a\nsingle a\u00c3\u00abroplane without any line of bases, but no one drew back from\nwhat seemed like the plainest necessity. We turned in at two o'clock\nfor a brief rest after some preliminary loading of the plane, but were\nup again in four hours to finish the loading and packing.\n\nAt seven fifteen a.m., January 25th, we started northwestward under\nMcTighe's pilotage with ten men, seven dogs, a sledge, a fuel and food\nsupply, and other items including the plane's wireless outfit. The\natmosphere was clear, fairly quiet, and relatively mild in temperature,\nand we anticipated very little trouble in reaching the latitude and\nlongitude designated by Lake as the site of his camp. Our apprehensions\nwere over what we might find, or fail to find, at the end of our\njourney, for silence continued to answer all calls dispatched to the\ncamp.\n\nEvery incident of that four-and-a-half-hour flight is burned into my\nrecollection because of its crucial position in my life. It marked my\nloss, at the age of fifty-four, of all that peace and balance which the\nnormal mind possesses through its accustomed conception of external\nnature and nature's laws.\n\nThenceforward the ten of us\u00e2\u0080\u0094but the student Danforth and myself\nabove all others\u00e2\u0080\u0094were to face a hideously amplified world of lurking\nhorrors which nothing can erase from our emotions, and which we\nwould refrain from sharing with mankind in general if we could. The\nnewspapers have printed the bulletins we sent from the moving plane,\ntelling of our nonstop course, our two battles with treacherous\nupper-air gales, our glimpse of the broken surface where Lake had sunk\nhis mid-journey shaft three days before, and our sight of a group of\nthose strange fluffy snow cylinders noted by Amundsen and Byrd as\nrolling in the wind across the endless leagues of frozen plateau.\n\nThere came a point, though, when our sensations could not be conveyed\nin any words the press would understand, and a later point when we had\nto adopt an actual rule of strict censorship.\n\nThe sailor Larsen was first to spy the jagged line of witchlike cones\nand pinnacles ahead, and his shouts sent every one to the windows of\nthe great cabined plane. Despite our speed, they were very slow in\ngaining prominence; hence we knew that they must be infinitely far off,\nand visible only because of their abnormal height.\n\nLittle by little, however, they rose grimly into the western sky,\nallowing us to distinguish various bare, bleak, blackish summits, and\nto catch the curious sense of phantasy which they inspired as seen\nin the reddish antarctic light against the provocative background of\niridescent ice-dust clouds.\n\nIn the whole spectacle there was a persistent, pervasive hint of\nstupendous secrecy and potential revelation. It was as if these\nstark, nightmare spires marked the pylons of a frightful gateway into\nforbidden spheres of dream, and complex gulfs of remote time, space,\nand ultradimensionality. I could not help feeling that they were evil\nthings\u00e2\u0080\u0094mountains of madness whose farther slopes looked out over some\naccursed ultimate abyss.\n\nThat seething, half-luminous cloud background held ineffable\nsuggestions of a vague, ethereal beyondness far more than terrestrially\nspatial, and gave appalling reminders of the utter remoteness,\nseparateness, desolation, and \u00c3\u00a6on-long death of this untrodden and\nunfathomed austral world.\n\nIt was young Danforth who drew our notice to the curious regularities\nof the higher mountain sky line\u00e2\u0080\u0094regularities like clinging fragments\nof perfect cubes, which Lake had mentioned in his messages, and which\nindeed justified his comparison with the dreamlike suggestions of\nprimordial temple ruins, on cloudy Asian mountaintops so subtly and\nstrangely painted by Roerich.\n\nThere was indeed something hauntingly Roerichlike about this whole\nunearthly continent of mountainous mystery. I had felt it in October\nwhen we first caught sight of Victoria Land, and I felt it afresh now.\nI felt, too, another wave of uneasy consciousness of arch\u00c3\u00a6an mythical\nresemblances, of how disturbingly this lethal realm corresponded to the\nevilly famed plateau of Leng in the primal writings.\n\nMythologists have placed Leng in Central Asia, but the racial memory of\nman\u00e2\u0080\u0094or of his predecessors\u00e2\u0080\u0094is long, and it may well be that certain\ntales have come down from lands and mountains and temples of horror\nearlier than Asia and earlier than any human world we know.\n\nA few daring mystics have hinted at a pre-Pleistocene origin for the\nfragmentary Pnakotic Manuscripts, and have suggested that the devotees\nof Tsathoggua were as alien to mankind as Tsathoggua itself.\n\nLeng, wherever in space or time it might brood, was not a region I\nwould care to be in or near, nor did I relish the proximity of a\nworld that had ever bred such ambiguous and arch\u00c3\u00a6an monstrosities as\nthose Lake had just mentioned. At the moment I felt sorry that I had\never read the abhorred Necronomicon , or talked so much with that\nunpleasantly erudite folklorist Wilmarth at the university.\n\nThis mood undoubtedly served to aggravate my reaction to the bizarre\nmirage which burst upon us from the increasingly opalescent zenith\nas we drew near the mountains and began to make out the cumulative\nundulations of the foothills. I had seen dozens of polar mirages during\nthe preceding weeks, some of them quite as uncanny and fantastically\nvivid as the present sample, but this one had a wholly novel and\nobscure quality of menacing symbolism, and I shuddered as the seething\nlabyrinth of fabulous walls and towers and minarets loomed out of the\ntroubled ice vapors above our heads.\n\nThe effect was that of a Cyclopean city of no architecture known to\nman or to human imagination, with vast aggregations of night-black\nmasonry embodying monstrous perversions of geometrical laws. There\nwere truncated cones, sometimes terraced or fluted, surmounted by\ntall cylindrical shafts here and there bulbously enlarged and often\ncapped with tiers of thinnish scalloped disks, and strange, beetling,\ntablelike constructions suggesting piles of multitudinous rectangular\nslabs or circular plates or five-pointed stars with each one\noverlapping the one beneath.\n\nThere were composite cones and pyramids either alone or surmounting\ncylinders or cubes or flatter truncated cones and pyramids, and\noccasional needlelike spires in curious clusters of five.\n\nAll of these febrile structures seemed knit together by tubular bridges\ncrossing from one to the other at various dizzy heights, and the\nimplied scale of the whole was terrifying and oppressive in its sheer\ngiganticism.\n\nThe general type of mirage was not unlike some of the wilder forms\nobserved and drawn by the arctic whaler Scoresby in 1820, but at\nthis time and place, with those dark, unknown mountain peaks soaring\nstupendously ahead, that anomalous elder-world discovery in our minds,\nand the pall of probable disaster enveloping the greater part of our\nexpedition, we all seemed to find in it a taint of latent malignity and\ninfinitely evil portent.\n\nI was glad when the mirage began to break up, though in the process\nthe various nightmare turrets and cones assumed distorted, temporary\nforms of even vaster hideousness. As the whole illusion dissolved to\nchurning opalescence, we began to look earthward again, and saw that\nour journey's end was not far off.\n\nThe unknown mountains ahead rose dizzily up like a fearsome rampart of\ngiants, their curious regularities showing with startling clearness\neven without a field glass. We were over the lowest foothills now, and\ncould see amidst the snow, ice, and bare patches of their main plateau\na couple of darkish spots which we took to be Lake's camp and boring.\n\nThe higher foothills shot up between five and six miles away, forming a\nrange almost distinct from the terrifying line of more than Himalayan\npeaks beyond them. At length Ropes\u00e2\u0080\u0094the student who had relieved\nMcTighe at the controls\u00e2\u0080\u0094began to head downward toward the left-hand\ndark spot whose size marked it as the camp. As he did so, McTighe sent\nout the last uncensored wireless message the world was to receive from\nour expedition.\n\nEvery one, of course, has read the brief and unsatisfying bulletins of\nthe rest of our antarctic sojourn.\n\nSome hours after our landing we sent a guarded report of the tragedy we\nfound, and reluctantly announced the wiping out of the whole Lake party\nby the frightful wind of the preceding day, or of the night before\nthat. There were eleven known dead, young Gedney was missing.\n\nPeople pardoned our hazy lack of details through realization of the\nshock the sad event must have caused us, and believed us when we\nexplained that the mangling action of the wind had rendered all eleven\nbodies unsuitable for transportation outside.\n\nIndeed, I flatter myself that even in the midst of our distress, utter\nbewilderment, and soul-clutching horror, we scarcely went beyond the\ntruth in any specific instance. The tremendous significance lies in\nwhat we dared not tell; what I would not tell now but for the need of\nwarning others off from nameless terrors.\n\nIt is a fact that the wind had wrought dreadful havoc. Whether all\ncould have lived through it, even without the other thing, is gravely\nopen to doubt. The storm, with its fury of madly driven ice particles,\nmust have been beyond anything our expedition had encountered before.\n\nOne a\u00c3\u00abroplane shelter\u00e2\u0080\u0094all, it seems, had been left in a far too flimsy\nand inadequate state\u00e2\u0080\u0094was nearly pulverized; and the derrick at the\ndistant boring was entirely shaken to pieces.\n\nThe exposed metal of the grounded planes and drilling machinery was\nbruised into a high polish, and two of the small tents were flattened\ndespite their snow banking. Wooden surfaces left out in the blast were\npitted and denuded of paint, and all signs of tracks in the snow were\ncompletely obliterated.\n\nIt is also true that we found none of the arch\u00c3\u00a6an biological objects in\na condition to take outside as a whole. We did gather some minerals\nfrom a vast, tumbled pile, including several of the greenish soapstone\nfragments whose odd five-pointed rounding and faint patterns of grouped\ndots caused so many doubtful comparisons, and some fossil bones, among\nwhich were the most typical of the curiously injured specimens.\n\nNone of the dogs survived, their hurriedly built snow inclosure near\nthe camp being almost wholly destroyed. The wind may have done that,\nthough the greater breakage, on the side next to the camp, which was\nnot the windward one, suggests an outward leap or break of the frantic\nbeasts themselves.\n\nAll three sledges were gone, and we have tried to explain that the wind\nmay have blown them off into the unknown. The drill and ice-melting\nmachinery at the boring were too badly damaged to warrant salvage, so\nwe used them to choke up that subtly disturbing gateway to the past\nwhich Lake had blasted.\n\nWe likewise left at the camp the two most shaken up of the planes;\nsince our surviving party had only four real pilots\u00e2\u0080\u0094Sherman, Danforth,\nMcTighe, and Ropes\u00e2\u0080\u0094in all, with Danforth in a poor nervous shape to\nnavigate. We brought back all the books, scientific equipment, and\nother incidentals we could find, though much was rather unaccountably\nblown away. Spare tents and furs were either missing or badly out of\ncondition.\n\nIt was approximately four p.m., after wide plane cruising had forced\nus to give Gedney up for lost, that we sent our guarded message to the Arkham for relaying; and I think we did well to keep it as calm and\nnoncommittal as we succeeded in doing.\n\nThe most we said about agitation concerned our dogs, whose frantic\nuneasiness near the biological specimens was to be expected from poor\nLake's accounts. We did not mention, I think, their display of the\nsame uneasiness when sniffing around the queer greenish soapstones\nand certain other objects in the disordered region\u00e2\u0080\u0094objects including\nscientific instruments, a\u00c3\u00abroplanes, and machinery, both at the camp\nand at the boring, whose parts had been loosened, moved, or otherwise\ntampered with by winds that must have harbored singular curiosity and\ninvestigativeness.\n\nAbout the fourteen biological specimens we were pardonably indefinite.\nWe said that the only ones we discovered were damaged, but that enough\nwas left of them to prove Lake's description wholly and impressively\naccurate. It was hard work keeping our personal emotions out of this\nmatter\u00e2\u0080\u0094and we did not mention numbers or say exactly how we had found\nthose which we did find. We had by that time agreed not to transmit\nanything suggesting madness on the part of Lake's men, and it surely\nlooked like madness to find six imperfect monstrosities carefully\nburied upright in nine-foot snow graves under five-pointed mounds\npunched over with groups of dots in patterns exactly like those on\nthe queer greenish soapstones dug up from Mesozoic or Tertiary times.\nThe eight perfect specimens mentioned by Lake seemed to have been\ncompletely blown away.\n\nWe were careful, too, about the public's general peace of mind; hence\nDanforth and I said little about that frightful trip over the mountains\nthe next day. It was the fact that only a radically lightened plane\ncould possibly cross a range of such height which mercifully limited\nthat scouting tour to the two of us.\n\nOn our return at one a.m., Danforth was close to hysterics, but kept an\nadmirably stiff upper lip. It took no persuasion to make him promise\nnot to show our sketches and the other things we brought away in our\npockets, not to say anything more to the others than what we had agreed\nto relay outside, and to hide our camera films for private development\nlater on; so that part of my present story will be as new to Pabodie,\nMcTighe, Ropes, Sherman, and the rest as it will be to that world in\ngeneral. Indeed\u00e2\u0080\u0094Danforth is closer mouthed than I: for he saw, or\nthinks he saw, one thing he will not tell even me.\n\nAs all know, our report included a tale of a hard ascent\u00e2\u0080\u0094a\nconfirmation of Lake's opinion that the great peaks are of arch\u00c3\u00a6an\nslate and other very primal crumpled strata unchanged since at least\nmiddle Comanchean time, a conventional comment on the regularity of the\nclinging cube and rampart formations, a decision that the cave mouths\nindicate dissolved calcareous veins, a conjecture that certain slopes\nand passes would permit of the scaling and crossing of the entire range\nby seasoned mountaineers, and a remark that the mysterious other side\nholds a lofty and immense superplateau as ancient and unchanging as the\nmountains themselves\u00e2\u0080\u0094twenty thousand feet in elevation, with grotesque\nrock formations protruding through a thin glacial layer and with low\ngradual foothills between the general plateau surface and the sheer\nprecipices of the highest peaks.\n\nThis body of data is in every respect true so far as it goes, and\nit completely satisfied the men at the camp. We laid our absence of\nsixteen hours\u00e2\u0080\u0094a longer time than our announced flying, landing,\nreconnoitering, and rock-collecting program called for\u00e2\u0080\u0094to a long\nmythical spell of adverse wind conditions, and told truly of our\nlanding on the farther foothills.\n\nFortunately our tale sounded realistic and prosaic enough not to tempt\nany of the others into emulating our flight. Had any tried to do that,\nI would have used every ounce of my persuasion to stop them\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I do\nnot know what Danforth would have done.\n\nWhile we were gone, Pabodie, Sherman, Ropes, McTighe, and Williamson\nhad worked like beavers over Lake's two best planes, fitting them\nagain for use, despite the altogether unaccountable juggling of their\noperative mechanism.\n\nWe decided to load all the planes the next morning and start back for\nour old base as soon as possible. Even though indirect, that was the\nsafest way to work toward McMurdo Sound; for a straight-line flight\nacross the most utterly unknown stretches of the \u00c3\u00a6on-dead continent\nwould involve many additional hazards.\n\nFurther exploration was hardly feasible in view of our tragic\ndecimation and the ruin of our drilling machinery. The doubts and\nhorrors around us\u00e2\u0080\u0094which we did not reveal\u00e2\u0080\u0094made us wish only to escape\nfrom this austral world of desolation and brooding madness as swiftly\nas we could.\n\nAs the public knows, our return to the world was accomplished without\nfurther disasters. All planes reached the old base on the evening of\nthe next day\u00e2\u0080\u0094January 27th\u00e2\u0080\u0094after a swift nonstop flight; and on the\n28th we made McMurdo Sound in two laps, the one pause being very brief,\nand occasioned by a faulty rudder, in the furious wind over the ice\nshelf after we had cleared the great plateau.\n\nIn five days more, the Arkham and Miskatonic , with all hands and\nequipment on board, were shaking clear of the thickening field ice\nand working up Ross Sea, with the mocking mountains of Victoria Land\nlooming westward against a troubled antarctic sky and twisting the\nwind's wails into a wide-ranged musical piping which chilled my soul to\nthe quick.\n\nLess than a fortnight later we left the last hint of polar land behind\nus and thanked heaven that we were clear of a haunted, accursed realm\nwhere life and death, space and time, have made black and blasphemous\nalliances in the unknown epochs since matter first writhed and swam on\nthe planet's scarce-cooled crust.\n\nSince our return we have all constantly worked to discourage antarctic\nexploration, and have kept certain doubts and guesses to ourselves with\nsplendid unity and faithfulness. Even young Danforth, with his nervous\nbreakdown, has not flinched or babbled to his doctors.\n\nIndeed, as I have said, there is one thing he thinks he alone saw\nwhich he will not tell even me, though I think it would help his\npsychological state if he would consent to do so. It might explain and\nrelieve much, though perhaps the thing was no more than the delusive\naftermath of an earlier shock. That is the impression I gather after\nthose rare, irresponsible moments when he whispers disjointed things to\nme\u00e2\u0080\u0094things which he repudiates vehemently as soon as he gets a grip on\nhimself again.\n\nIt will be hard work deterring others from the great white south, and\nsome of our efforts may directly harm our cause by drawing inquiring\nnotice. We might have known from the first that human curiosity is\nundying, and that the results we announced would be enough to spur\nothers ahead on the same age-long pursuit of the unknown.\n\nLake's reports of those biological monstrosities had aroused\nnaturalists and pal\u00c3\u00a6ontologists to the highest pitch, though we were\nsensible enough not to show the detached parts we had taken from the\nactual buried specimens, or our photographs of those specimens as\nthey were found. We also refrained from showing the more puzzling of\nthe scarred bones and greenish soapstones; while Danforth and I have\nclosely guarded the pictures we took or drew on the superplateau across\nthe range, and the crumpled things we smoothed, studied in terror, and\nbrought away in our pockets.\n\nBut now that Starkweather-Moore party is organizing, and with a\nthoroughness far beyond anything our outfit attempted\u00e2\u0080\u0094if not\ndissuaded, they will get to the innermost nucleus of the antarctic\nand melt and bore till they bring up that which we know may end the\nworld. So I must break through all reticences at last\u00e2\u0080\u0094even about that\nultimate, nameless thing beyond the mountains of madness.\n\nIV.\n\nIt is only with vast hesitancy and repugnance that I let my mind go\nback to Lake's camp and what we really found there\u00e2\u0080\u0094and to that other\nthing beyond the awful mountain wall.\n\nI have told of the wind-ravaged terrain, the damaged shelters, the\ndisarranged machinery, the varied uneasiness of our dogs, the missing\nsledges and other items, the deaths of men and dogs, the absence of\nGedney, and the six insanely buried biological specimens, strangely\nsound in texture for all their structural injuries, from a world forty\nmillion years dead. I do not recall whether I mentioned that upon\nchecking up the canine bodies we found one dog missing. We did not\nthink much about that till later\u00e2\u0080\u0094indeed, only Danforth and I have\nthought of it at all.\n\nThe principal things I have been keeping back relate to the bodies,\nand to certain subtle points which may or may not lend a hideous and\nincredible kind of rationale to the apparent chaos.\n\nAt the time, I tried to keep the men's minds off those points; for\nit was so much simpler\u00e2\u0080\u0094so much more normal\u00e2\u0080\u0094to lay everything to an\noutbreak of madness on the part of some of Lake's party. From the look\nof things, that demon mountain wind must have been enough to drive\nany man mad in the midst of this center of all earthly mystery and\ndesolation.\n\nThe crowning abnormality, of course, was the condition of the\nbodies\u00e2\u0080\u0094men and dogs alike. They had all been in some terrible kind\nof conflict, and were torn and mangled in fiendish and altogether\ninexplicable ways. Death, so far as we could judge, had in each case\ncome from strangulation or laceration.\n\nThe dogs had evidently started the trouble, for the state of their\nill-built corral bore witness to its forcible breakage from within.\nIt had been set some distance from the camp because of the hatred of\nthe animals for those hellish arch\u00c3\u00a6an organisms, but the precaution\nseemed to have been taken in vain. When left alone in that monstrous\nwind, behind flimsy walls of insufficient height, they must have\nstampeded\u00e2\u0080\u0094whether from the wind itself, or from some subtle,\nincreasing odor emitted by the nightmare specimens, one could not say.\n\nBut whatever had happened, it was hideous and revolting enough.\nPerhaps I had better put squeamishness aside and tell the worst at\nlast\u00e2\u0080\u0094though with a categorical statement of opinion, based on the\nfirst-hand observations and most rigid deductions of both Danforth and\nmyself, that the then missing Gedney was in no way responsible for the\nloathsome horrors we found.\n\nI have said that the bodies were frightfully mangled. Now I must\nadd that some were incised and subtracted from in the most curious,\ncold-blooded, and inhuman fashion. It was the same with dogs and men.\nAll the healthier, fatter bodies, quadrupedal or bipedal, had had\ntheir most solid masses of tissue cut out and removed, as by a careful\nbutcher; and around them was a strange sprinkling of salt\u00e2\u0080\u0094taken from\nthe ravaged provision chests on the planes\u00e2\u0080\u0094which conjured up the most\nhorrible associations.\n\nThe thing had occurred in one of the crude a\u00c3\u00abroplane shelters from\nwhich the plane had been dragged out, and subsequent winds had effaced\nall tracks which could have supplied any plausible theory. Scattered\nbits of clothing, roughly slashed from the human incision subjects,\nhinted no clues.\n\nIt is useless to bring up the half impression of certain faint snow\nprints in one shielded corner of the ruined inclosure\u00e2\u0080\u0094because that\nimpression did not concern human prints at all, but was clearly\nmixed up with all the talk of fossil prints which poor Lake had been\ngiving throughout the preceding weeks. One had to be careful of one's\nimagination in the lee of those overshadowing mountains of madness.\n\nAs I have indicated, Gedney and one dog turned out to be missing in\nthe end. When we came on that terrible shelter we had missed two dogs\nand two men; but the fairly unharmed dissecting tent, which we entered\nafter investigating the monstrous graves, had something to reveal.\n\nIt was not as Lake had left it, for the covered parts of the primal\nmonstrosity had been removed from the improvised table. Indeed, we had\nalready realized that one of the six imperfect and insanely buried\nthings we had found\u00e2\u0080\u0094the one with the trace of a peculiarly hateful\nodor\u00e2\u0080\u0094must represent the collected sections of the entity which Lake\nhad tried to analyze.\n\nOn and around that laboratory table were strewn other things, and it\ndid not take long for us to guess that those things were the carefully,\nthough oddly and inexpertly dissected parts of one man and one dog. I\nshall spare the feelings of survivors by omitting mention of the man's\nidentity.\n\nLake's anatomical instruments were missing, but there were evidences\nof their careful cleansing. The gasoline stove was also gone, though\naround it we found a curious litter of matches. We buried the human\nparts beside the other ten men, and the canine parts with the other\nthirty-five dogs. Concerning the bizarre smudges on the laboratory\ntable, and on the jumble of roughly handled illustrated books scattered\nnear it, we were much too bewildered to speculate.\n\nThis formed the worst of the camp horror, but other things were\nequally perplexing. The disappearance of Gedney, the one dog, the\neight uninjured biological specimens, the three sledges, and certain\ninstruments, illustrated technical and scientific books, writing\nmaterials, electric torches and batteries, food and fuel, heating\napparatus, spare tents, fur suits, and the like, was utterly beyond\nsane conjecture; as were likewise the spatter-fringed ink blots on\ncertain pieces of paper, and the evidences of curious alien fumbling\nand experimentation around the planes and all other mechanical devices\nboth at the camp and at the boring. The dogs seemed to abhor this oddly\ndisordered machinery.\n\nThen, too, there was the upsetting of the larder, the disappearance\nof certain staples, and the jarringly comical heap of tin cans pried\nopen in the most unlikely ways and at the most unlikely places. The\nprofusion of scattered matches, intact, broken, or spent, formed\nanother minor enigma\u00e2\u0080\u0094as did the two or three tent cloths and fur suits\nwhich we found lying about with peculiar and unorthodox slashings\nconceivably due to clumsy efforts at unimaginable adaptations.\n\nThe maltreatment of the human and canine bodies, and the crazy burial\nof the damaged arch\u00c3\u00a6an specimens, were all of a piece with this\napparent disintegrative madness. In view of just such an eventuality\nas the present one, we carefully photographed all the main evidences\nof insane disorder at the camp; and shall use the prints to buttress\nour pleas against the departure of the proposed Starkweather-Moore\nExpedition.\n\nOur first act after finding the bodies in the shelter was to photograph\nand open the row of insane graves with the five-pointed snow mounds.\nWe could not help noticing the resemblance of these monstrous mounds,\nwith their clusters of grouped dots, to poor Lake's descriptions of the\nstrange greenish soapstones; and when we came on some of the soapstones\nthemselves in the great mineral pile we found the likeness very close\nindeed.\n\nThe whole general formation, it must be made clear, seemed abominably\nsuggestive of the starfish head of the arch\u00c3\u00a6an entities; and we agreed\nthat the suggestion must have worked potently upon the sensitized minds\nof Lake's overwrought party.\n\nFor madness\u00e2\u0080\u0094centering in Gedney as the only possible surviving\nagent\u00e2\u0080\u0094was the explanation spontaneously adopted by everybody so far\nas spoken utterance was concerned; though I will not be so na\u00c3\u00afve as\nto deny that each of us may have harbored wild guesses which sanity\nforbade him to formulate completely.\n\nSherman, Pabodie, and McTighe made an exhaustive a\u00c3\u00abroplane cruise over\nall the surrounding territory in the afternoon, sweeping the horizon\nwith field glasses in quest of Gedney and of the various missing\nthings; but nothing came to light.\n\nThe party reported that the titan-barrier range extended endlessly to\nright and left alike, without any diminution in height or essential\nstructure. On some of the peaks, though, the regular cube and rampart\nformations were bolder and plainer, having doubly fantastic similitudes\nto Roerich-painted Asian hill ruins. The distribution of cryptical cave\nmouths on the black snow-denuded summits seemed roughly even as far as\nthe range could be traced.\n\nIn spite of all the prevailing horrors we were left with enough sheer\nscientific zeal and adventurousness to wonder about the unknown realm\nbeyond those mysterious mountains.\n\nAs our guarded messages stated, we rested at midnight after our day of\nterror and bafflement\u00e2\u0080\u0094but not without a tentative plan for one or more\nrange-crossing altitude flights in a lightened plane with a\u00c3\u00abrial camera\nand geologist's outfit, beginning the following morning.\n\nIt was decided that Danforth and I try it first, and we awaked at seven\na.m. intending an early trip; though heavy winds\u00e2\u0080\u0094mentioned in our\nbrief bulletin to the outside world\u00e2\u0080\u0094delayed our start till nearly nine\no'clock.\n\nI have already repeated the noncommittal story we told the men at\ncamp\u00e2\u0080\u0094and relayed outside\u00e2\u0080\u0094after our return sixteen hours later.\nIt is now my terrible duty to amplify this account by filling in\nthe merciful blanks with hints of what we really saw in that hidden\ntransmontane world\u00e2\u0080\u0094hints of the revelations which have finally driven\nDanforth to a nervous collapse.\n\nI wish he would add a really frank word about the thing which he thinks\nhe alone saw\u00e2\u0080\u0094even though it was probably a nervous delusion\u00e2\u0080\u0094and which\nwas perhaps the last straw that put him where he is; but he is firm\nagainst that. All I can do is to repeat his later disjointed whispers\nabout what set him shrieking as the plane soared back through the\nwind-tortured mountain pass after that real and tangible shock which I\nshared.\n\nThis will form my last word. If the plain signs of surviving elder\nhorrors in what I disclose be not enough to keep others from meddling\nwith the inner antarctic\u00e2\u0080\u0094or at least from prying too deeply beneath\nthe surface of that ultimate waste of forbidden secrets and unhuman,\n\u00c3\u00a6on-cursed desolation\u00e2\u0080\u0094the responsibility for unnamable and perhaps\nimmeasurable evils will not be mine.\n\nDanforth and I, studying the notes made by Pabodie in his afternoon\nflight and checking up with a sextant, had calculated that the lowest\navailable pass in the range lay somewhat to the right of us, within\nsight of camp, and about twenty-three thousand or twenty-four thousand\nfeet above sea-level. For this point, then, we first headed in the\nlightened plane as we embarked on our flight of discovery.\n\nThe camp itself, on foothills which sprang from a high continental\nplateau, was some twelve thousand feet in altitude; hence the\nactual height increase necessary was not so vast as it might seem.\nNevertheless we were acutely conscious of the rarefied air and intense\ncold as we rose; for, on account of visibility conditions, we had\nto leave the cabin windows open. We were dressed, of course, in our\nheaviest furs.\n\nAs we drew near the forbidding peaks, dark and sinister above the\nline of crevasse-riven snow and interstitial glaciers, we noticed more\nand more the curiously regular formations clinging to the slopes; and\nthought again of the strange Asian paintings of Nicholas Roerich.\n\nThe ancient and wind-weathered rock strata fully verified all of\nLake's bulletins, and proved that these pinnacles had been towering\nup in exactly the same way since a surprisingly early time in earth's\nhistory\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps over fifty million years. How much higher they had\nonce been, it was futile to guess; but everything about this strange\nregion pointed to obscure atmospheric influences unfavorable to\nchange, and calculated to retard the usual climatic processes of rock\ndisintegration.\n\nBut it was the mountainside tangle of regular cubes, ramparts, and cave\nmouths which fascinated and disturbed us most. I studied them with a\nfield glass and took a\u00c3\u00abrial photographs while Danforth drove; and at\ntimes I relieved him at the controls\u00e2\u0080\u0094though my aviation knowledge was\npurely an amateur's\u00e2\u0080\u0094in order to let him use the binoculars.\n\nWe could easily see that much of the material of the things was a\nlightish arch\u00c3\u00a6an quartzite, unlike any formation visible over broad\nareas of the general surface; and that their regularity was extreme and\nuncanny to an extent which poor Lake had scarcely hinted.\n\nAs he had said, their edges were crumbled and rounded from untold\n\u00c3\u00a6ons of savage weathering; but their preternatural solidity and tough\nmaterial had saved them from obliteration. Many parts, especially\nthose closest to the slopes, seemed identical in substance with the\nsurrounding rock surface.\n\nThe whole arrangement looked like the ruins of Macchu Picchu in\nthe Andes, or the primal foundation walls of Kish as dug up by the\nOxford-Field Museum Expedition in 1929; and both Danforth and I\nobtained that occasional impression of separate Cyclopean blocks which\nLake had attributed to his flight-companion Carroll.\n\nHow to account for such things in this place was frankly beyond me, and\nI felt queerly humbled as a geologist. Igneous formations often have\nstrange regularities\u00e2\u0080\u0094like the famous Giants' Causeway in Ireland\u00e2\u0080\u0094but\nthis stupendous range, despite Lake's original suspicion of smoking\ncones, was above all else nonvolcanic in evident structure.\n\nThe curious cave mouths, near which the odd formation seemed most\nabundant, presented another, albeit a lesser puzzle because of their\nregularity of outline. They were, as Lake's bulletin had said, often\napproximately square or semicircular; as if the natural orifices had\nbeen shaped to greater symmetry by some magic hand. Their numerousness\nand wide distribution were remarkable, and suggested that the whole\nregion was honeycombed with tunnels dissolved out of limestone strata.\n\nSuch glimpses as we secured did not extend far within the caverns, but\nwe saw that they were apparently clear of stalactites and stalagmites.\nOutside, those parts of the mountain slopes adjoining the apertures\nseemed invariably smooth and regular; and Danforth thought that the\nslight cracks and pittings of the weathering tended toward unusual\npatterns.\n\nFilled as he was with the horrors and strangenesses discovered at the\ncamp, he hinted that the pittings vaguely resembled those baffling\ngroups of dots sprinkled over the primeval greenish soapstones, so\nhideously duplicated on the madly conceived snow mounds above those six\nburied monstrosities.\n\nWe had risen gradually in flying over the higher foothills and along\ntoward the relatively low pass we had selected. As we advanced we\noccasionally looked down at the snow and ice of the land route,\nwondering whether we could have attempted the trip with the simpler\nequipment of earlier days.\n\nSomewhat to our surprise we saw that the terrain was far from difficult\nas such things go; and that despite the crevasses and other bad spots\nit would not have been likely to deter the sledges of a Scott, a\nShackleton, or an Amundsen. Some of the glaciers appeared to lead up to\nwind-bared passes with unusual continuity, and upon reaching our chosen\npass we found that its case formed no exception.\n\nOur sensations of tense expectancy as we prepared to round the crest\nand peer out over an untrodden world can hardly be described on paper;\neven though we had no cause to think the regions beyond the range\nessentially different from those already seen and traversed. The touch\nof evil mystery in these barrier mountains, and in the beckoning sea of\nopalescent sky glimpsed betwixt their summits, was a highly subtle and\nattenuated matter not to be explained in literal words. Rather was it\nan affair of vague psychological symbolism and \u00c3\u00a6sthetic association\u00e2\u0080\u0094a\nthing mixed up with exotic poetry and paintings, and with archaic myths\nlurking in shunned and forbidden volumes.\n\nEven the wind's burden held a peculiar strain of conscious malignity;\nand for a second it seemed that the composite sound included a bizarre\nmusical whistling, or piping over a wide range as the blast swept in\nand out of the omnipresent and resonant cave mouths. There was a cloudy\nnote of reminiscent repulsion in this sound, as complex and unplaceable\nas any of the other dark impressions.\n\nWe were now, after a slow ascent, at a height of twenty-three thousand\nfive hundred and seventy feet according to the aneroid; and had left\nthe region of clinging snow definitely below us. Up here were only\ndark, bare rock slopes and the start of rough-ribbed glaciers\u00e2\u0080\u0094but with\nthose provocative cubes, ramparts, and echoing cave mouths to add a\nportent of the unnatural, the fantastic, and the dreamlike.\n\nLooking along the line of high peaks, I thought I could see the one\nmentioned by poor Lake, with a rampart exactly on top. It seemed to be\nhalf lost in a queer antarctic haze\u00e2\u0080\u0094such a haze, perhaps, as had been\nresponsible for Lake's early notion of volcanism.\n\nThe pass loomed directly before us, smooth and windswept between its\njagged and malignly frowning pylons. Beyond it was a sky fretted with\nswirling vapors and lighted by the low polar sun\u00e2\u0080\u0094the sky of that\nmysterious farther realm upon which we felt no human eye had ever gazed.\n\nA few more feet of altitude and we would behold that realm. Danforth\nand I, unable to speak except in shouts amidst the howling, piping wind\nthat raced through the pass and added to the noise of the unmuffled\nengines, exchanged eloquent glances. And then, having gained those last\nfew feet, we did indeed stare across the momentous divide and over the\nunsampled secrets of an elder and utterly alien earth.\n\nV.\n\nI think that both of us simultaneously cried out in mixed awe, wonder,\nterror, and disbelief in our own senses as we finally cleared the pass\nand saw what lay beyond. Of course, we must have had some natural\ntheory in the back of our heads to steady our faculties for the moment.\nProbably we thought of such things as the grotesquely weathered stones\nof the Garden of the Gods in Colorado, or the fantastically symmetrical\nwind-carved rocks of the Arizona desert. Perhaps we even half thought\nthe sight a mirage like that we had seen the morning before on first\napproaching those mountains of madness.\n\nWe must have had some such normal notions to fall back upon as our\neyes swept that limitless, tempest-scarred plateau and grasped the\nalmost endless labyrinth of colossal, regular, and geometrically\neurythmic stone masses which reared their crumbled and pitted crests\nabove a glacial sheet not more than forty or fifty feet deep at its\nthickest, and in places obviously thinner.\n\nThe effect of the monstrous sight was indescribable, for some fiendish\nviolation of known natural law seemed certain at the outset. Here,\non a hellishly ancient table-land fully twenty thousand feet high,\nand in a climate deadly to habitation since a prehuman age not less\nthan five hundred thousand years ago, there stretched nearly to the\nvision's limit a tangle of orderly stone which only the desperation of\nmental self-defense could possibly attribute to any but a conscious and\nartificial cause.\n\nThe effect of the monstrous sight was indescribable! Some fiendish violation of natural law!\n\nWe had previously dismissed, so far as serious thought was concerned,\nany theory that the cubes and ramparts of the mountainsides were other\nthan natural in origin. How could they be otherwise, when man himself\ncould scarcely have been differentiated from the great apes at the time\nwhen this region succumbed to the present unbroken reign of glacial\ndeath?\n\nYet now the sway of reason seemed irrefutably shaken, for this\nCyclopean maze of squared, curved, and angled blocks had features which\ncut off all comfortable refuge. It was, very clearly, the blasphemous\ncity of the mirage in stark, objective, and ineluctable reality. That\ndamnable portent had had a material basis after all\u00e2\u0080\u0094there had been\nsome horizontal stratum of ice dust in the upper air, and this shocking\nstone survival had projected its image across the mountains according\nto the simple laws of reflection. Of course, the phantom had been\ntwisted and exaggerated, and had contained things which the real source\ndid not contain; yet now, as we saw that real source, we thought it\neven more hideous and menacing than its distant image.\n\nIt was, very clearly, the blasphemous city of the mirage\u00e2\u0080\u0094in stark, objective reality!\n\nOnly the incredible, unhuman massiveness of these vast stone towers\nand ramparts had saved the frightful thing from utter annihilation in\nthe hundreds of thousands\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps millions\u00e2\u0080\u0094of years it had brooded\nthere amidst the blasts of a bleak upland. \"Corona Mundi\u00e2\u0080\u0094Roof of the\nWorld\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\" All sorts of fantastic phrases sprang to our lips as we\nlooked dizzily down at the unbelievable spectacle.\n\nI thought again of the eldritch primal myths that had so persistently\nhaunted me since my first sight of this dead antarctic world\u00e2\u0080\u0094of\nthe demonic plateau of Leng, of the Mi-Go, or Abominable Snow Men\nof the Himalayas, of the Pnakotic Manuscripts with their prehuman\nimplications, of the Cthulhu cult, of the Necronomicon , and of the\nHyperborean legends of formless Tsathoggua and the worse than formless\nstar spawn associated with that semientity.\n\nFor boundless miles in every direction the thing stretched off with\nvery little thinning; indeed, as our eyes followed it to the right and\nleft along the base of the low, gradual foothills which separated it\nfrom the actual mountain rim, we decided that we could see no thinning\nat all except for an interruption at the left of the pass through\nwhich we had come. We had merely struck, at random, a limited part of\nsomething of incalculable extent.\n\nThe foothills were more sparsely sprinkled with grotesque stone\nstructures, linking the terrible city to the already familiar cubes and\nramparts which evidently formed its mountain outposts. These latter,\nas well as the queer cave mouths, were as thick on the inner as on the\nouter sides of the mountains.\n\nThe nameless stone labyrinth consisted, for the most part, of\nwalls from ten to one hundred and fifty feet in ice-clear height,\nand of a thickness varying from five to ten feet. It was composed\nmostly of prodigious blocks of dark primordial slate, schist, and\nsandstone\u00e2\u0080\u0094blocks in many cases as large as 4 \u00c3\u0097 6 \u00c3\u0097 8 feet\u00e2\u0080\u0094though in\nseveral places it seemed to be carved out of a solid, uneven bed rock\nof pre-Cambrian slate.\n\nThe buildings were far from equal in size, there being innumerable\nhoneycomb arrangements of enormous extent as well as smaller separate\nstructures.\n\nThe general shape of these things tended to be conical, pyramidal, or\nterraced; though there were many perfect cylinders, perfect cubes,\nclusters of cubes, and other rectangular forms, and a peculiar\nsprinkling of angled edifices whose five-pointed ground plan roughly\nsuggested modern fortifications. The builders had made constant and\nexpert use of the principle of the arch, and domes had probably existed\nin the city's heyday.\n\nThe whole tangle was monstrously weathered, and the glacial surface\nfrom where the towers projected was strewn with fallen blocks and\nimmemorial d\u00c3\u00a9bris. Where the glaciation was transparent we could see\nthe lower parts of the gigantic piles, and we noticed the ice-preserved\nstone bridges which connected the different towers at varying distances\nabove the ground. On the exposed walls we could detect the scarred\nplaces where other and higher bridges of the same sort had existed.\n\nCloser inspection revealed countless largish windows; some of which\nwere closed with shutters of a petrified material originally wood,\nthough most gaped open in a sinister and menacing fashion.\n\nMany of the ruins, of course, were roofless, and with uneven though\nwind-rounded upper edges; whilst others, of a more sharply conical or\npyramidal model or else protected by higher surrounding structures,\npreserved intact outlines despite the omnipresent crumbling and\npitting. With the field glass we could barely make out what seemed to\nbe sculptural decorations in horizontal bands\u00e2\u0080\u0094decorations including\nthose curious groups of dots whose presence on the ancient soapstones\nnow assumed a vastly larger significance.\n\nIn many places the buildings were totally ruined and the ice sheet\ndeeply riven from various geologic causes. In other places the\nstonework was worn down to the very level of the glaciation. One\nbroad swath, extending from the plateau's interior to a cleft in the\nfoothills about a mile to the left of the pass we had traversed, was\nwholly free from buildings. It probably represented, we concluded,\nthe course of some great river which in Tertiary times\u00e2\u0080\u0094millions\nof years ago\u00e2\u0080\u0094had poured through the city and into some prodigious\nsubterranean abyss of the great barrier range. Certainly, this was\nabove all a region of caves, gulfs, and underground secrets beyond\nhuman penetration.\n\nLooking back to our sensations, and recalling our dazedness at viewing\nthis monstrous survival from \u00c3\u00a6ons we had thought prehuman, I can only\nwonder that we preserved the semblance of equilibrium which we did.\nOf course, we knew that something\u00e2\u0080\u0094chronology, scientific theory, or\nour own consciousness\u00e2\u0080\u0094was woefully awry; yet we kept enough poise to\nguide the plane, observe many things quite minutely, and take a careful\nseries of photographs which may yet serve both us and the world in good\nstead.\n\nIn my case, ingrained scientific habit may have helped; for above all\nmy bewilderment and sense of menace there burned a dominant curiosity\nto fathom more of this age-old secret\u00e2\u0080\u0094to know what sort of beings\nhad built and lived in this incalculably gigantic place, and what\nrelation to the general world of its time or of other times so unique a\nconcentration of life could have had.\n\nFor this place could be no ordinary city. It must have formed the\nprimary nucleus and center of some archaic and unbelievable chapter of\nearth's history whose outward ramifications, recalled only dimly in the\nmost obscure and distorted myths, had vanished utterly amidst the chaos\nof terrene convulsions long before any human race we know had shambled\nout of apedom.\n\nHere sprawled a Pal\u00c3\u00a6og\u00c3\u00a6an megalopolis compared with which the fabled\nAtlantis and Lemuria, Commoriom and Uzuldaroum, and Olatho\u00c3\u00ab in the\nland of Lomar are recent things of to-day\u00e2\u0080\u0094not even of yesterday;\na megalopolis ranking with such whispered prehuman blasphemies as\nValusia, R'lyeh, Ib in the land of Mnar, and the Nameless City of\nArabia Deserta.\n\nAs we flew above that tangle of stark Titan towers my imagination\nsometimes escaped all bounds and roved aimlessly in realms of fantastic\nassociations\u00e2\u0080\u0094even weaving links betwixt this lost world and some of my\nown wildest dreams concerning the mad horror at the camp.\n\nThe plane's fuel tank, in the interest of greater lightness, had\nbeen only partly filled; hence we now had to exert caution in our\nexplorations. Even so, however, we covered an enormous extent of\nground\u00e2\u0080\u0094or rather, air\u00e2\u0080\u0094after swooping down to a level where the wind\nbecame virtually negligible.\n\nThere seemed to be no limit to the mountain range, or to the length\nof the frightful stone city which bordered its inner foothills. Fifty\nmiles of flight in each direction showed no major change in the\nlabyrinth of rock and masonry that clawed up corpselike through the\neternal ice.\n\nThere were, though, some highly absorbing diversifications; such as\nthe carvings on the canyon where that broad river had once pierced the\nfoothills and approached its sinking place in the great range.\n\nThe headlands at the stream's entrance had been boldly carved into\nCyclopean pylons; and something about the ridgy, barrel-shaped designs\nstirred up oddly vague, hateful, and confusing semiremembrances in both\nDanforth and me.\n\nWe also came upon several star-shaped open spaces, evidently public\nsquares, and noted various undulations in the terrain. Where a sharp\nhill rose, it was generally hollowed out into some sort of rambling\nstone edifice; but there were at least two exceptions. Of these latter,\none was too badly weathered to disclose what had been on the jutting\neminence, while the other still bore a fantastic conical monument\ncarved out of the solid rock and roughly resembling such things as the\nwell-known Snake Tomb in the ancient valley of Petra.\n\nFlying inland from the mountains, we discovered that the city was\nnot of infinite width, even though its length along the foothills\nseemed endless. After about thirty miles the grotesque stone buildings\nbegan to thin out, and in ten more miles we came to an unbroken waste\nvirtually without signs of sentient artifice. The course of the river\nbeyond the city seemed marked by a broad, depressed line, while the\nland assumed a somewhat greater ruggedness, seeming to slope slightly\nupward as it receded in the mist-hazed west.\n\nSo far we had made no landing, yet to leave the plateau without an\nattempt at entering some of the monstrous structures would have been\ninconceivable. Accordingly, we decided to find a smooth place on the\nfoothills near our navigable pass, there grounding the plane and\npreparing to do some exploration on foot.\n\nThough these gradual slopes were partly covered with a scattering of\nruins, low flying soon disclosed an ample number of possible landing\nplaces. Selecting that nearest to the pass, since our next flight would\nbe across the great range and back to camp, we succeeded about twelve\nthirty p.m. in coming down on a smooth, hard snow field wholly devoid\nof obstacles and well adapted to a swift and favorable take-off later\non.\n\nIt did not seem necessary to protect the plane with a snow banking for\nso brief a time and in so comfortable an absence of high winds at this\nlevel; hence we merely saw that the landing skis were safely lodged,\nand that the vital parts of the mechanism were guarded against the cold.\n\nFor our foot journey we discarded the heaviest of our flying furs, and\ntook with us a small outfit consisting of pocket compass, hand camera,\nlight provisions, voluminous notebooks and paper, geologist's hammer\nand chisel, specimen bags, coil of climbing rope, and powerful electric\ntorches with extra batteries; this equipment having been carried in the\nplane on the chance that we might be able to effect a landing, take\nground pictures, make drawings and topographical sketches, and obtain\nrock specimens from some bare slope, outcropping, or mountain cave.\n\nFortunately, we had a supply of extra paper to tear up, place in a\nspare specimen bag, and use on the ancient principle of hare and hounds\nfor marking our course in any interior mazes we might be able to\npenetrate. This had been brought in case we found some cave system with\nair quiet enough to allow such a rapid and easy method in place of the\nusual rock-chipping method of trail blazing.\n\nWalking cautiously downhill over the crusted snow, toward the\nstupendous stone labyrinth that loomed against the opalescent west,\nwe felt almost as keen a sense of imminent marvels as we had felt on\napproaching the unfathomed mountain pass four hours previously.\n\nTrue, we had become visually familiar with the incredible secret\nconcealed by the barrier peaks; yet the prospect of actually entering\nprimordial walls reared by conscious beings perhaps millions of years\nago\u00e2\u0080\u0094before any known race of men could have existed\u00e2\u0080\u0094was none the\nless awesome and potentially terrible in its implications of cosmic\nabnormality.\n\nThough the thinness of the air at this prodigious altitude made\nexertion somewhat more difficult than usual, both Danforth and I found\nourselves bearing up very well, and felt equal to almost any task which\nmight fall to our lot.\n\nIt took only a few steps to bring us to a shapeless ruin worn level\nwith the snow, while ten or fifteen rods farther on there was a huge,\nroofless rampart still complete in its gigantic five-pointed outline,\nand rising to an irregular height of ten or eleven feet. For this\nlatter we headed; and when at last we were actually able to touch\nits weathered Cyclopean blocks, we felt that we had established an\nunprecedented and almost blasphemous link with forgotten \u00c3\u00a6ons normally\nclosed to our species.\n\nThis rampart, shaped like a star and perhaps three hundred feet from\npoint to point, was built of Jurassic sandstone blocks of irregular\nsize, averaging 6 x 8 feet in surface. There was a row of arched\nloopholes or windows about four feet wide and five feet high, spaced\nquite symmetrically along the points of the star and at its inner\nangles, and with the bottoms about four feet from the glaciated surface.\n\nLooking through these, we could see that the masonry was fully five\nfeet thick, that there were no partitions remaining within, and that\nthere were traces of banded carvings or bas-reliefs on the interior\nwalls\u00e2\u0080\u0094facts we had indeed guessed before, when flying low over this\nrampart and others like it. Though lower parts must have originally\nexisted, all traces of such things were now wholly obscured by the deep\nlayer of ice and snow at this point.\n\nWe crawled through one of the windows and vainly tried to decipher\nthe nearly effaced mural designs, but did not attempt to disturb\nthe glaciated floor. Our orientation flights had indicated that many\nbuildings in the city proper were less ice-choked, and that we might\nperhaps find wholly clear interiors leading down to the true ground\nlevel if we entered those structures still roofed at the top.\n\nBefore we left the rampart we photographed it carefully, and studied\nits mortarless Cyclopean masonry with complete bewilderment. We wished\nthat Pabodie were present, for his engineering knowledge might have\nhelped us guess how such titanic blocks could have been handled in that\nunbelievably remote age when the city and its outskirts were built up.\n\nThe half-mile walk downhill to the actual city, with the upper wind\nshrieking vainly and savagely through the skyward peaks in the\nbackground, was something of which the smallest details will always\nremain engraved on my mind. Only in fantastic nightmares could any\nhuman beings but Danforth and me conceive such optical effects.\n\nBetween us and the churning vapors of the west lay that monstrous\ntangle of dark stone towers, its outr\u00c3\u00a9 and incredible forms impressing\nus afresh at every new angle of vision. It was a mirage in solid stone,\nand were it not for the photographs I would still doubt that such a\nthing could be. The general type of masonry was identical with that\nof the rampart we had examined; but the extravagant shapes which this\nmasonry took in its urban manifestations were past all description.\n\nEven the pictures illustrate only one or two phases of its endless\nvariety, preternatural massiveness, and utterly alien exoticism. There\nwere geometrical forms for which an Euclid could scarcely find a\nname\u00e2\u0080\u0094cones of all degrees of irregularity and truncation, terraces\nof every sort of provocative disproportion, shafts with odd bulbous\nenlargements, broken columns in curious groups, and five-pointed or\nfive-ridged arrangements of mad grotesqueness.\n\nAs we drew nearer we could see beneath certain transparent parts of the\nice sheet, and detect some of the tubular stone bridges that connected\nthe crazily sprinkled structures at various heights. Of orderly streets\nthere seemed to be none, the only broad open swath being a mile to the\nleft, where the ancient river had doubtless flowed through the town\ninto the mountains.\n\nOur field glasses showed the external, horizontal bands of nearly\neffaced sculptures and dot groups to be very prevalent, and we could\nhalf imagine what the city must once have looked like\u00e2\u0080\u0094even though most\nof the roofs and tower tops had necessarily perished.\n\nAs a whole, it had been a complex tangle of twisted lanes and alleys,\nall of them deep canyons, and some little better than tunnels because\nof the overhanging masonry or overarching bridges.\n\nNow, outspread below us, it loomed like a dream phantasy against a\nwestward mist through whose northern end the low, reddish antarctic sun\nof early afternoon was struggling to shine; and when, for a moment,\nthat sun encountered a denser obstruction and plunged the scene into\ntemporary shadow, the effect was subtly menacing in a way I can never\nhope to depict. Even the faint howling and piping of the unfelt wind in\nthe great mountain passes behind us took on a wilder note of purposeful\nmalignity.\n\nThe last stage of our descent to the town was unusually steep and\nabrupt, and a rock outcropping at the edge where the grade changed led\nus to think that an artificial terrace had once existed there. Under\nthe glaciation, we believed, there must be a flight of steps or its\nequivalent.\n\nWhen at last we plunged into the town itself, clambering over fallen\nmasonry and shrinking from the oppressive nearness and dwarfing height\nof omnipresent crumbling and pitted walls, our sensations again became\nsuch that I marvel at the amount of self-control we retained.\n\nDanforth was frankly jumpy, and began making some offensively\nirrelevant speculations about the horror at the camp\u00e2\u0080\u0094which I resented\nall the more because I could not help sharing certain conclusions\nforced upon us by many features of this morbid survival from nightmare\nantiquity.\n\nThe speculations worked on his imagination, too; for in one\nplace\u00e2\u0080\u0094where a d\u00c3\u00a9bris-littered alley turned a sharp corner\u00e2\u0080\u0094he insisted\nthat he saw faint traces of ground markings which he did not like;\nwhilst elsewhere he stopped to listen to a subtle, imaginary sound\nfrom some undefined point\u00e2\u0080\u0094a muffled musical piping, he said, not\nunlike that of the wind in the mountain caves, yet somehow disturbingly\ndifferent.\n\nThe ceaseless five-pointedness of the surrounding architecture and\nof the few distinguishable mural arabesques had a dimly sinister\nsuggestiveness we could not escape, and gave us a touch of terrible\nsubconscious certainty concerning the primal entities which had reared\nand dwelt in this unhallowed place.\n\nNevertheless, our scientific and adventurous souls were not wholly\ndead, and we mechanically carried out our program of chipping specimens\nfrom all the different rock types represented in the masonry. We wished\na rather full set in order to draw better conclusions regarding the age\nof the place.\n\nNothing in the great outer walls seemed to date from later than the\nJurassic and Comanchean periods, nor was any piece of stone in the\nentire place of a greater recency than the Pliocene age. In stark\ncertainty, we were wandering amidst a death which had reigned at least\nfive hundred thousand years, and in all probability even longer.\n\nAs we proceeded through this maze of stone-shadowed twilight we stopped\nat all available apertures to study interiors and investigate entrance\npossibilities. Some were above our reach, whilst others led only into\nice-choked ruins as unroofed and barren as the rampart on the hill.\n\nOne, though spacious and inviting, opened on a seemingly bottomless\nabyss without visible means of descent. Now and then we had a chance to\nstudy the petrified wood of a surviving shutter, and were impressed by\nthe fabulous antiquity implied in the still discernible grain. These\nthings had come from Mesozoic gymnosperms and conifers\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially\nCretaceous cycads\u00e2\u0080\u0094and from fan palms and early angiosperms of plainly\nTertiary date. Nothing definitely later than the Pliocene could be\ndiscovered.\n\nIn the placing of these shutters\u00e2\u0080\u0094whose edges showed the former\npresence of queer and long-vanished hinges\u00e2\u0080\u0094usage seemed to be\nvaried\u00e2\u0080\u0094some being on the outer and some on the inner side of the\ndeep embrasures. They seemed to have become wedged in place, thus\nsurviving the rusting of their former and probably metallic fixtures\nand fastenings.\n\nAfter a time we came across a row of windows\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the bulges of a\ncolossal five-edged cone of undamaged apex\u00e2\u0080\u0094which led into a vast,\nwell-preserved room with stone flooring; but these were too high in\nthe room to permit descent without a rope. We had a rope with us,\nbut did not wish to bother with this twenty-foot drop unless obliged\nto\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially in this thin plateau air where great demands were made\nupon the heart action.\n\nThis enormous room was probably a hall or concourse of some sort, and\nour electric torches showed bold, distinct, and potentially startling\nsculptures arranged round the walls in broad, horizontal bands\nseparated by equally broad strips of conventional arabesques. We took\ncareful note of this spot, planning to enter here unless a more easily\ngained interior was encountered.\n\nFinally, though, we did encounter exactly the opening we wished; an\narchway about six feet wide and ten feet high, marking the former end\nof an a\u00c3\u00abrial bridge which had spanned an alley about five feet above\nthe present level of glaciation. These archways, of course, were flush\nwith upper-story floors, and in this case one of the floors still\nexisted.\n\nThe building thus accessible was a series of rectangular terraces\non our left facing westward. That across the alley, where the other\narchway yawned, was a decrepit cylinder with no windows and with\na curious bulge about ten feet above the aperture. It was totally\ndark inside, and the archway seemed to open on a well of illimitable\nemptiness.\n\nHeaped d\u00c3\u00a9bris made the entrance to the vast left-hand building doubly\neasy, yet for a moment we hesitated before taking advantage of the\nlong-wished chance. For though we had penetrated into this tangle of\narchaic mystery, it required fresh resolution to carry us actually\ninside a complete and surviving building of a fabulous elder world\nwhose nature was becoming more and more hideously plain to us.\n\nIn the end, however, we made the plunge, and scrambled up over the\nrubble into the gaping embrasure. The floor beyond was of great slate\nslabs, and seemed to form the outlet of a long, high corridor with\nsculptured walls.\n\nObserving the many inner archways which led off from it, and realizing\nthe probable complexity of the nest of apartments within, we decided\nthat we must begin our system of hare-and-hound trail blazing. Hitherto\nour compasses, together with frequent glimpses of the vast mountain\nrange between the towers in our rear, had been enough to prevent our\nlosing our way; but from now on, the artificial substitute would be\nnecessary.\n\nAccordingly we reduced our extra paper to shreds of suitable size,\nplaced these in a bag to be carried by Danforth, and prepared to use\nthem as economically as safety would allow. This method would probably\ngain us immunity from straying, since there did not appear to be any\nstrong air currents inside the primordial masonry. If such should\ndevelop, or if our paper supply should give out, we could of course\nfall back on the more secure though more tedious and retarding method\nof rock chipping.\n\nJust how extensive a territory we had opened up, it was impossible\nto guess without a trial. The close and frequent connection of the\ndifferent buildings made it likely that we might cross from one to\nanother on bridges underneath the ice, except where impeded by local\ncollapses and geologic rifts, for very little glaciation seemed to have\nentered the massive constructions.\n\nAlmost all the areas of transparent ice had revealed the submerged\nwindows as tightly shuttered, as if the town had been left in that\nuniform state until the glacial sheet came to crystallize the lower\npart for all succeeding time. Indeed, one gained a curious impression\nthat this place had been deliberately closed and deserted in some dim,\nbygone \u00c3\u00a6on, rather than overwhelmed by any sudden calamity or even\ngradual decay. Had the coming of the ice been foreseen, and had a\nnameless population left en masse to seek a less doomed abode?\n\nThe precise physiographic conditions attending the formation of the\nice sheet at this point would have to wait for later solution. It had\nnot, very plainly, been a grinding drive. Perhaps the pressure of\naccumulated snows had been responsible, and perhaps some flood from\nthe river, or from the bursting of some ancient glacial dam in the\ngreat range, had helped to create the special state now observable.\nImagination could conceive almost anything in connection with this\nplace.\n\nVI.\n\nIt would be cumbrous to give a detailed, consecutive account of\nour wanderings inside that cavernous, \u00c3\u00a6on-dead honeycomb of primal\nmasonry\u00e2\u0080\u0094that monstrous lair of elder secrets which now echoed for the\nfirst time, after uncounted epochs, to the tread of human feet.\n\nThis is especially true because so much of the horrible drama and\nrevelation came from a mere study of the omnipresent mural carvings.\nOur flash-light photographs of those carvings will do much toward\nproving the truth of what we are now disclosing, and it is lamentable\nthat we had not a larger film supply with us. As it was, we made crude\nnotebook sketches of certain salient features after all our films were\nused up.\n\nThe building which we had entered was one of great size and\nelaborateness, and gave us an impressive notion of the architecture of\nthat nameless geologic past. The inner partitions were less massive\nthan the outer walls, but on the lower levels were excellently\npreserved. Labyrinthine complexity, involving curiously irregular\ndifferences in floor levels, characterized the entire arrangement; and\nwe should certainly have been lost at the very outset but for the trail\nof torn paper left behind us.\n\nWe decided to explore the more decrepit upper parts first of all, hence\nclimbed aloft in the maze for a distance of some one hundred feet, to\nwhere the topmost tier of chambers yawned snowily and ruinously open to\nthe polar sky. Ascent was effected over the steep, transversely ribbed\nstone ramps or inclined planes which everywhere served in lieu of\nstairs.\n\nThe rooms we encountered were of all imaginable shapes and proportions,\nranging from five-pointed stars to triangles and perfect cubes. It\nmight be safe to say that their general average was about 30 x 30 feet\nin floor area, and twenty feet in height, though many larger apartments\nexisted.\n\nAfter thoroughly examining the upper regions and the glacial level\nwe descended, story by story, into the submerged part, where indeed\nwe soon saw we were in a continuous maze of connected chambers and\npassages probably leading over unlimited areas outside this particular\nbuilding.\n\nThe Cyclopean massiveness and giganticism of everything about us became\ncuriously oppressive; and there was something vaguely but deeply\nunhuman in all the contours, dimensions, proportions, decorations, and\nconstructional nuances of the blasphemously archaic stonework. We soon\nrealized, from what the carvings revealed, that this monstrous city was\nmany million years old.\n\nWe cannot yet explain the engineering principles used in the anomalous\nbalancing and adjustment of the vast rock masses, though the function\nof the arch was clearly much relied on. The rooms we visited were\nwholly bare of all portable contents, a circumstance which sustained\nour belief in the city's deliberate desertion. The prime decorative\nfeature was the almost universal system of mural sculpture, which\ntended to run in continuous horizontal bands three feet wide and\narranged from floor to ceiling in alternation with bands of equal width\ngiven over to geometrical arabesques.\n\nThere were exceptions to this rule of arrangement, but its\npreponderance was overwhelming. Often, however, a series of smooth\ncartouches containing oddly patterned groups of dots would be sunk\nalong one of the arabesque bands.\n\nThe technique, we soon saw, was mature, accomplished, and \u00c3\u00a6sthetically\nevolved to the highest degree of civilized mastery, though utterly\nalien in every detail to any known art tradition of the human race.\nIn delicacy of execution no sculpture I have ever seen could approach\nit. The minutest details of elaborate vegetation, or of animal life,\nwere rendered with astonishing vividness despite the bold scale of the\ncarvings; whilst the conventional designs were marvels of skillful\nintricacy.\n\nThe arabesques displayed a profound use of mathematical principles, and\nwere made up of obscurely symmetrical curves and angles based on the\nquantity of five.\n\nThe pictorial bands followed a highly formalized tradition, and\ninvolved a peculiar treatment of perspective, but had an artistic force\nthat moved us profoundly notwithstanding the intervening gulf of vast\ngeologic periods.\n\nTheir method of design hinged on a singular juxtaposition of the cross\nsection with the two-dimensional silhouette, and embodied an analytical\npsychology beyond that of any known race of antiquity. It is useless to\ntry to compare this art with any represented in our museums. Those who\nsee our photographs will probably find its closest analogue in certain\ngrotesque conceptions of the most daring futurists.\n\nThe arabesque tracery consisted altogether of depressed lines, whose\ndepth on unweathered walls varied from one to two inches. When\ncartouches with dot groups appeared\u00e2\u0080\u0094evidently as inscriptions in some\nunknown and primordial language and alphabet\u00e2\u0080\u0094the depression of the\nsmooth surface was perhaps an inch and a half, and of the dots perhaps\na half inch more. The pictorial bands were in countersunk low relief,\ntheir background being depressed about two inches from the original\nwall surface.\n\nIn some specimens marks of a former coloration could be detected,\nthough for the most part the untold \u00c3\u00a6ons had disintegrated and banished\nany pigments which may have been applied. The more one studied the\nmarvelous technique the more one admired the things. Beneath their\nstrict conventionalization one could grasp the minute and accurate\nobservation and graphic skill of the artists; and indeed, the very\nconventions themselves served to symbolize and accentuate the real\nessence or vital differentiation of every object delineated.\n\nWe felt, too, that besides these recognizable excellences there\nwere others lurking beyond the reach of our perceptions. Certain\ntouches here and there gave vague hints of latent symbols and stimuli\nwhich another mental and emotional background, and a fuller or\ndifferent sensory equipment, might have made of profound and poignant\nsignificance to us.\n\nThe subject matter of the sculptures obviously came from the life of\nthe vanished epoch of their creation, and contained a large proportion\nof evident history. It is this abnormal historic-mindedness of the\nprimal race\u00e2\u0080\u0094a chance circumstance operating, through coincidence,\nmiraculously in our favor\u00e2\u0080\u0094which made the carvings so awesomely\ninformative to us, and which caused us to place their photography and\ntranscription above all other considerations.\n\nIn certain rooms the dominant arrangement was varied by the presence of\nmaps, astronomical charts, and other scientific designs on an enlarged\nscale\u00e2\u0080\u0094these things giving a na\u00c3\u00afve and terrible corroboration to what\nwe gathered from the pictorial friezes and dados.\n\nIn hinting at what the whole revealed, I can only hope that my account\nwill not arouse a curiosity greater than sane caution on the part of\nthose who believe me at all. It would be tragic if any were to be\nallured to that realm of death and horror by the very warning meant to\ndiscourage them.\n\nInterrupting these sculptured walls were high windows and massive\ntwelve-foot doorways; both now and then retaining the petrified wooden\nplanks\u00e2\u0080\u0094elaborately carved and polished\u00e2\u0080\u0094of the actual shutters and\ndoors. All metal fixtures had long ago vanished, but some of the doors\nremained in place and had to be forced aside as we progressed from room\nto room.\n\nWindow frames with odd transparent panes\u00e2\u0080\u0094mostly elliptical\u00e2\u0080\u0094survived\nhere and there, though in no considerable quantity. There were also\nfrequent niches of great magnitude, generally empty, but once in a\nwhile containing some bizarre object carved from green soapstone which\nwas either broken or perhaps held too inferior to warrant removal.\n\nOther apertures were undoubtedly connected with bygone mechanical\nfacilities\u00e2\u0080\u0094heating, lighting, and the like\u00e2\u0080\u0094of a sort suggested in\nmany of the carvings. Ceilings tended to be plain, but had sometimes\nbeen inlaid with green soapstone or other tiles, mostly fallen now.\nFloors were also paved with such tiles, though plain stonework\npredominated.\n\nAs I have said, all furniture and other movables were absent; but the\nsculptures gave a clear idea of the strange devices which had once\nfilled these tomblike, echoing rooms. Above the glacial sheet the\nfloors were generally thick with detritus, litter, and d\u00c3\u00a9bris, but\nfarther down this condition decreased.\n\nIn some of the lower chambers and corridors there was little more than\ngritty dust or ancient incrustations, while occasional areas had an\nuncanny air of newly swept immaculateness. Of course, where rifts or\ncollapses had occurred, the lower levels were as littered as the\nupper ones.\n\nA central court\u00e2\u0080\u0094as we had seen in other structures, from the\nair\u00e2\u0080\u0094saved the inner regions from total darkness; so that we seldom had\nto use our electric torches in the upper rooms except when studying\nsculptured details. Below the ice cap, however, the twilight deepened;\nand in many parts of the tangled ground level there was an approach to\nabsolute blackness.\n\nTo form even a rudimentary idea of our thoughts and feelings as we\npenetrated this \u00c3\u00a6on-silent maze of unhuman masonry one must correlate\na hopelessly bewildering chaos of fugitive moods, memories, and\nimpressions. The sheer appalling antiquity and lethal desolation of the\nplace were enough to overwhelm almost any sensitive person, but added\nto these elements were the recent unexplained horror at the camp, and\nthe revelations all too soon effected by the terrible mural sculptures\naround us.\n\nThe moment we came upon a perfect section of carving, where no\nambiguity of interpretation could exist, it took only a brief study\nto give us the hideous truth\u00e2\u0080\u0094a truth which it would be na\u00c3\u00afve to claim\nDanforth and I had not independently suspected before, though we had\ncarefully refrained from even hinting it to each other. There could\nnow be no further merciful doubt about the nature of the beings which\nhad built and inhabited this monstrous dead city millions of years\nago, when man's ancestors were primitive archaic mammals, and vast\nDinosauria roamed the tropical steppes of Europe and Asia.\n\nWe had previously clung to a desperate alternative and insisted\u00e2\u0080\u0094each\nto himself\u00e2\u0080\u0094that the omnipresence of the five-pointed motif meant only\nsome cultural or religious exaltation of the arch\u00c3\u00a6an natural object\nwhich had so patently embodied the quality of five-pointedness; as the\ndecorative motifs of Minoan Crete exalted the sacred bull, those of\nEgypt the scarab\u00c3\u00a6us, those of Rome the wolf and the eagle, and those of\nvarious savage tribes some chosen totem animal.\n\nBut this lone refuge was now stripped from us, and we were forced to\nface definitely the reason-shaking realization which the reader of\nthese pages has doubtless long ago anticipated. I can scarcely bear to\nwrite it down in black and white even now, but perhaps that will not be\nnecessary.\n\nThe things once rearing and dwelling in this frightful masonry in the\nage of Dinosauria were not indeed Dinosauria, but far worse. Mere\nDinosauria were new and almost brainless objects\u00e2\u0080\u0094but the builders of\nthe city were wise and old, and had left certain traces in rocks even\nthen laid down well nigh a thousand million years\u00e2\u0080\u0094rocks laid down\nbefore the true life of earth had advanced beyond plastic groups of\ncells\u00e2\u0080\u0094rocks laid down before the true life of earth had existed at all.\n\nThey were the makers and enslavers of that life, and above all doubt\nthe originals of the fiendish elder myths which things like the\nPnakotic Manuscripts and the Necronomicon affrightedly hint about.\nThey were the great \"Old Ones\" that had filtered down from the stars\nwhen earth was young\u00e2\u0080\u0094the beings whose substance an alien evolution had\nshaped, and whose powers were such as this planet had never bred. And\nto think that only the day before Danforth and I had actually looked\nupon fragments of their millennially fossilized substance\u00e2\u0080\u0094and that\npoor Lake and his party had seen their complete outlines\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nIt is, of course, impossible for me to relate in proper order the\nstages by which we picked up what we know of that monstrous chapter of\nprehuman life. After the first shock of the certain revelation, we had\nto pause a while to recuperate, and it was fully three o'clock before\nwe got started on our actual tour of systematic research.\n\nThe sculptures in the building we entered were of relatively late\ndate\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps two million years ago\u00e2\u0080\u0094as checked up by geological,\nbiological, and astronomical features\u00e2\u0080\u0094and embodied an art which would\nbe called decadent in comparison with that of specimens we found in\nolder buildings, after crossing bridges under the glacial sheet.\n\nOne edifice hewn from the solid rock seemed to go back forty or\npossibly even fifty million years\u00e2\u0080\u0094to the lower Eocene or upper\nCretaceous\u00e2\u0080\u0094and contained bas-reliefs of an artistry surpassing\nanything else, with one tremendous exception, that we encountered. That\nwas, we have since agreed, the oldest domestic structure we traversed.\n\nWere it not for the support of those flashlights soon to be made\npublic, I would refrain from telling what I found and inferred, lest I\nbe confined as a madman. Of course, the infinitely early parts of the\npatchwork tale\u00e2\u0080\u0094representing the preterrestrial life of the star-headed\nbeings on other planets, in other galaxies, and in other universes\u00e2\u0080\u0094can\nreadily be interpreted as the fantastic mythology of those beings\nthemselves; yet such parts sometimes involved designs and diagrams so\nuncannily close to the latest findings of mathematics and astrophysics\nthat I scarcely know what to think. Let others judge when they see the\nphotographs I shall publish.\n\nNaturally, no one set of carvings which we encountered told more than a\nfraction of any connected story, nor did we even begin to come upon the\nvarious stages of that story in their proper order. Some of the vast\nrooms were independent units so far as their designs were concerned,\nwhilst in other cases a continuous chronicle would be carried through a\nseries of rooms and corridors.\n\nThe best of the maps and diagrams were on the walls of a frightful\nabyss below even the ancient ground level\u00e2\u0080\u0094a cavern perhaps two hundred\nfeet square and sixty feet high, which had almost undoubtedly been an\neducational center of some sort.\n\nThere were many provoking repetitions of the same material in different\nrooms and buildings, since certain chapters of experience, and certain\nsummaries or phases of racial history, had evidently been favorites\nwith different decorators or dwellers. Sometimes, though, variant\nversions of the same theme proved useful in settling debatable points\nand filling up gaps.\n\nI still wonder that we deduced so much in the short time at our\ndisposal. Of course, we even now have only the barest outline\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\nmuch of that was obtained later on from a study of the photographs and\nsketches we made.\n\nIt may be the effect of this later study\u00e2\u0080\u0094the revived memories and\nvague impressions acting in conjunction with his general sensitiveness\nand with that final supposed horror-glimpse whose essence he will not\nreveal even to me\u00e2\u0080\u0094which has been the immediate source of Danforth's\npresent breakdown.\n\nBut it had to be; for we could not issue our warning intelligently\nwithout the fullest possible information, and the issuance of that\nwarning is a prime necessity. Certain lingering influences in that\nunknown antarctic world of disordered time and alien natural law make\nit imperative that further exploration be discouraged.\n\nVII.\n\nThe full story, so far as deciphered, will eventually appear in an\nofficial bulletin of Miskatonic University. Here I shall sketch only\nthe salient highlights in a formless, rambling way. Myth or otherwise,\nthe sculptures told of the coming of those star-headed things to the\nnascent, lifeless earth out of cosmic space\u00e2\u0080\u0094their coming, and the\ncoming of many other alien entities such as at certain times embark\nupon spatial pioneering.\n\nThey seemed able to traverse the interstellar ether on their vast\nmembranous wings\u00e2\u0080\u0094thus oddly confirming some curious hill folklore long\nago told me by an antiquarian colleague. They had lived under the sea a\ngood deal, building fantastic cities and fighting terrific battles with\nnameless adversaries by means of intricate devices employing unknown\nprinciples of energy.\n\nEvidently their scientific and mechanical knowledge far surpassed\nman's to-day, though they made use of its more widespread and elaborate\nforms only when obliged to.\n\nSome of the sculptures suggested that they had passed through a stage\nof mechanized life on other planets, but had receded upon finding\nits effects emotionally unsatisfying. Their preternatural toughness\nof organization and simplicity of natural wants made them peculiarly\nable to live on a high plane without the more specialized fruits\nof artificial manufacture, and even without garments, except for\noccasional protection against the elements.\n\nIt was under the sea, at first for food and later for other purposes,\nthat they first created earth life\u00e2\u0080\u0094using available substances\naccording to long-known methods.\n\nThe more elaborate experiments came after the annihilation of various\ncosmic enemies. They had done the same thing on other planets, having\nmanufactured not only necessary foods, but certain multicellular\nprotoplasmic masses capable of molding their tissues into all sorts of\ntemporary organs under hypnotic influence and thereby forming ideal\nslaves to perform the heavy work of the community.\n\nThese viscous masses were without doubt what Abdul Alhazred whispered\nabout as the \"Shoggoths\" in his frightful Necronomicon , though even\nthat mad Arab had not hinted that any existed on earth except in the\ndreams of those who had chewed a certain alkaloidal herb.\n\nWhen the star-headed Old Ones on this planet had synthesized their\nsimple food forms and bred a good supply of Shoggoths, they allowed\nother cell groups to develop into other forms of animal and vegetable\nlife for sundry purposes, extirpating any whose presence became\ntroublesome.\n\nWith the aid of the Shoggoths, whose expansions could be made to lift\nprodigious weights, the small, low cities under the sea grew to vast\nand imposing labyrinths of stone not unlike those which later rose on\nland. Indeed, the highly adaptable Old Ones had lived much on land in\nother parts of the universe, and probably retained many traditions of\nland construction.\n\nAs we studied the architecture of all these sculptured Pal\u00c3\u00a6og\u00c3\u00a6an\ncities, including that whose \u00c3\u00a6on-dead corridors we were even then\ntraversing, we were impressed by a curious coincidence which we have\nnot yet tried to explain, even to ourselves. The tops of the buildings,\nwhich in the actual city around us had, of course, been weathered into\nshapeless ruins ages ago, were clearly displayed in the bas-reliefs,\nand showed vast clusters of needlelike spires, delicate finials\non certain cone and pyramid apexes, and tiers of thin, horizontal\nscalloped disks capping cylindrical shafts.\n\nThis was exactly what we had seen in that monstrous and portentous\nmirage, cast by a dead city whence such sky-line features had been\nabsent for thousands and ten of thousands of years, which loomed on our\nignorant eyes across the unfathomed mountains of madness as we first\napproached poor Lake's ill-fated camp.\n\nOf the life of the Old Ones, both under the sea and after part of them\nmigrated to land, volumes could be written. Those in shallow water had\ncontinued the fullest use of the eyes at the ends of their five main\nhead tentacles, and had practiced the arts of sculpture and of writing\nin quite the usual way\u00e2\u0080\u0094the writing accomplished with a stylus on\nwaterproof waxen surfaces.\n\nThose lower down in the ocean depths, though they used a curious\nphosphorescent organism to furnish light, pieced out their vision with\nobscure special senses operating through the prismatic cilia on their\nheads\u00e2\u0080\u0094senses which rendered all the Old Ones partly independent of\nlight in emergencies. Their forms of sculpture and writing had changed\ncuriously during the descent, embodying certain apparently chemical\ncoating processes\u00e2\u0080\u0094probably to secure phosphorescence\u00e2\u0080\u0094which the\nbas-reliefs could not make clear to us.\n\nThe beings moved in the sea partly by swimming\u00e2\u0080\u0094using the lateral\ncrinoid arms\u00e2\u0080\u0094and partly by wriggling with the lower tier of tentacles\ncontaining the pseudofeet. Occasionally they accomplished long swoops\nwith the auxiliary use of two or more sets of their fan-like folding\nwings.\n\nOn land they locally used the pseudofeet, but now and then flew to\ngreat heights or over long distances with their wings. The many\nslender tentacles into which the crinoid arms branched were infinitely\ndelicate, flexible, strong, and accurate in muscular-nervous\nco\u00c3\u00b6rdination\u00e2\u0080\u0094ensuring the utmost skill and dexterity in all artistic\nand other manual operations.\n\nThe toughness of the things was almost incredible. Even the terrific\npressure of the deepest sea bottoms appeared powerless to harm them.\nVery few seemed to die at all except by violence, and their burial\nplaces were very limited. The facts that they covered their vertically\ninhumed dead with five-pointed inscribed mounds set up thoughts in\nDanforth and me which made a fresh pause and recuperation necessary\nafter the sculptures revealed it.\n\nThe toughness of the things was almost incredible. Even terrific pressures were powerless to harm them!\n\nThe beings multiplied by means of spores\u00e2\u0080\u0094like vegetable pteridophyta,\nas Lake had suspected\u00e2\u0080\u0094but, owing to their prodigious toughness and\nlongevity, and consequent lack of replacement needs, they did not\nencourage the large-scale development of new prothallia except when\nthey had new regions to colonize.\n\nThe young matured swiftly, and received an education evidently beyond\nany standard we can imagine. The prevailing intellectual and \u00c3\u00a6sthetic\nlife was highly evolved, and produced a tenaciously enduring set of\ncustoms and institutions which I shall describe more fully in my coming\nmonograph. These varied slightly according to sea or land residence,\nbut had the same foundations and essentials.\n\nThough able, like vegetables, to derive nourishment from inorganic\nsubstances; they vastly preferred organic and especially animal food.\nThey ate uncooked marine life under the sea, but cooked their viands on\nland. They hunted game and raised meat herds\u00e2\u0080\u0094slaughtering with sharp\nweapons whose odd marks on certain fossil bones our expedition had\nnoted.\n\nThey resisted all ordinary temperatures marvelously, and in their\nnatural state could live in water down to freezing. When the great\nchill of the Pleistocene drew on, however\u00e2\u0080\u0094nearly a million years\nago\u00e2\u0080\u0094the land dwellers had to resort to special measures, including\nartificial heating\u00e2\u0080\u0094until, at last, the deadly cold appears to have\ndriven them back into the sea.\n\nFor their prehistoric flights through cosmic space, legend said, they\nhad absorbed certain chemicals and become almost independent of eating,\nbreathing, or heat conditions\u00e2\u0080\u0094but by the time of the great cold\nthey had lost track of the method. In any case, they could not have\nprolonged the artificial state indefinitely without harm.\n\nBeing nonpairing and semivegetable in structure, the Old Ones had\nno biological basis for the family phase of mammal life, but seemed\nto organize large households on the principles of comfortable\nspace-utility and\u00e2\u0080\u0094as we deduced from the pictured occupations and\ndiversions of codwellers\u00e2\u0080\u0094congenial mental association.\n\nIn furnishing their homes they kept everything in the center of the\nhuge rooms, leaving all wall spaces free for decorative treatment.\nLighting, in the case of the land inhabitants, was accomplished by a\ndevice probably electro-chemical in nature.\n\nBoth on land and under water they used curious tables, chairs and\ncouches like cylindrical frames\u00e2\u0080\u0094for they rested and slept upright with\nfolded-down tentacles\u00e2\u0080\u0094and racks for the hinged sets of dotted surfaces\nforming their books.\n\nGovernment was evidently complex and probably socialistic, though no\ncertainties in this regard could be deduced from the sculptures we\nsaw. There was extensive commerce, both local and between different\ncities\u00e2\u0080\u0094certain small, flat counters, five-pointed and inscribed,\nserving as money. Probably the smaller of the various greenish\nsoapstones found by our expedition were pieces of such currency.\n\nThough the culture was mainly urban, some agriculture and much stock\nraising existed. Mining and a limited amount of manufacturing were also\npracticed. Travel was very frequent, but permanent migration seemed\nrelatively rare except for the vast colonizing movements by which the\nrace expanded.\n\nFor personal locomotion no external aid was used, since in land, air,\nand water movement alike the Old Ones seemed to possess excessively\nvast capacities for speed. Loads, however, were drawn by beasts of\nburden\u00e2\u0080\u0094Shoggoths under the sea, and a curious variety of primitive\nvertebrates in the later years of land existence.\n\nThese vertebrates, as well as an infinity of other life forms\u00e2\u0080\u0094animal\nand vegetable, marine, terrestrial, and a\u00c3\u00abrial\u00e2\u0080\u0094were the products of\nunguided evolution acting on life cells made by the Old Ones, but\nescaping beyond their radius of attention. They had been suffered\nto develop unchecked because they had not come in conflict with the\ndominant beings. Bothersome forms, of course, were mechanically\nexterminated.\n\nIt interested us to see in some of the very last and most decadent\nsculptures a shambling, primitive mammal, used sometimes for food and\nsometimes as an amusing buffoon by the land dwellers, whose vaguely\nsimian and human foreshadowings were unmistakable. In the building of\nland cities the huge stone blocks of the high towers were generally\nlifted by vast-winged pterodactyls of a species heretofore unknown to\npal\u00c3\u00a6ontology.\n\nThe persistence with which the Old Ones survived various geologic\nchanges and convulsions of the earth's crust was little short of\nmiraculous. Though few or none of their first cities seem to have\nremained beyond the Arch\u00c3\u00a6an Age, there was no interruption in their\ncivilization or in the transmission of their records.\n\nTheir original place of advent to the planet was the Antarctic Ocean,\nand it is likely that they came not long after the matter forming the\nmoon was wrenched from the neighboring South Pacific. According to one\nof the sculptured maps, the whole globe was then under water, with\nstone cities scattered farther and farther from the antarctic as \u00c3\u00a6ons\npassed.\n\nAnother map shows a vast bulk of dry land around the south pole, where\nit is evident that some of the beings made experimental settlements,\nthough their main centers were transferred to the nearest sea bottom.\n\nLater maps, which display this land mass as cracking and drifting, and\nsending certain detached parts northward, uphold in a striking way the\ntheories of continental drift lately advanced by Taylor, Wegener, and\nJoly.\n\nWith the upheaval of new land in the South Pacific, tremendous events\nbegan. Some of the marine cities were hopelessly shattered, yet that\nwas not the worst misfortune. Another race\u00e2\u0080\u0094a land race of beings\nshaped like octopi and probably corresponding to the fabulous prehuman\nspawn of Cthulhu\u00e2\u0080\u0094soon began filtering down from cosmic infinity and\nprecipitated a monstrous war which for a time drove the Old Ones\nwholly back to the sea\u00e2\u0080\u0094a colossal blow in view of the increasing land\nsettlements.\n\nLater, peace was made, and the new lands were given to the Cthulhu\nspawn whilst the Old Ones held the sea and the older lands. New land\ncities were founded\u00e2\u0080\u0094the greatest of them in the antarctic, for this\nregion of first arrival was sacred.\n\nFrom then on, as before, the antarctic remained the center of the Old\nOnes' civilization, and all the cities built there by the Cthulhu spawn\nwere blotted out.\n\nThen, suddenly, the lands of the Pacific sank again, taking with them\nthe frightful stone city of R'lyeh and all the cosmic octopi, so that\nthe Old Ones were again supreme on the planet, except for one shadowy\nfear about which they did not like to speak.\n\nAt a rather later age their cities dotted all the land and water areas\nof the globe\u00e2\u0080\u0094hence the recommendation in my coming monograph that some\narch\u00c3\u00a6ologist make systematic borings with Pabodie's type of apparatus\nin certain widely separated regions.\n\nThe steady trend down the ages was from water to land\u00e2\u0080\u0094a movement\nencouraged by the rise of new land masses, though the ocean was never\nwholly deserted. Another cause of the landward movement was the new\ndifficulty in breeding and managing the Shoggoths upon which successful\nsea life depended.\n\nWith the march of time, as the sculptures sadly confessed, the art of\ncreating new life from inorganic matter had been lost, so that the Old\nOnes had to depend on the molding of forms already in existence. On\nland the great reptiles proved highly tractable; but the Shoggoths of\nthe sea, reproducing by fission and acquiring a dangerous degree of\naccidental intelligence, presented for a time a formidable problem.\n\nThey had always been controlled through the hypnotic suggestion of\nthe Old Ones, and had modeled their tough plasticity into various\nuseful temporary limbs and organs; but now their self-modeling powers\nwere sometimes exercised independently, and in various imitative\nforms implanted by past suggestion. They had, it seems, developed a\nsemistable brain whose separate and occasionally stubborn volition\nechoed the will of the Old Ones without always obeying it.\n\nSculptured images of these Shoggoths filled Danforth and me with\nhorror and loathing. They were normally shapeless entities composed\nof a viscous jelly which looked like an agglutination of bubbles, and\neach averaged about fifteen feet in diameter when a sphere. They had,\nhowever, a constantly shifting shape and volume\u00e2\u0080\u0094throwing out temporary\ndevelopments or forming apparent organs of sight, hearing, and speech\nin imitation of their masters, either spontaneously or according to\nsuggestion.\n\nThey seem to have become peculiarly intractable toward the middle of\nthe Permian Age, perhaps one hundred and fifty million years ago, when\na veritable war of resubjugation was waged upon them by the marine Old\nOnes. Pictures of this war, and of the headless, slime-coated fashion\nin which the Shoggoths typically left their slain victims, held a\nmarvelously fearsome quality despite the intervening abyss of untold\nages.\n\nThe Old Ones had used curious weapons of molecular disturbance against\nthe rebel entities, and in the end had achieved a complete victory.\nThereafter the sculptures showed a period in which Shoggoths were tamed\nand broken by armed Old Ones as the wild horses of the American west\nwere tamed by cowboys.\n\nThough during the rebellion the Shoggoths had shown an ability to\nlive out of water, this transition was not encouraged\u00e2\u0080\u0094since their\nusefulness on land would hardly have been commensurate with the trouble\nof their management.\n\nDuring the Jurassic Age the Old Ones met fresh adversity in the\nform of a new invasion from outer space\u00e2\u0080\u0094this time by half-fungous,\nhalf-crustacean creatures\u00e2\u0080\u0094creatures undoubtedly the same as those\nfiguring in certain whispered hill legends of the north, and remembered\nin the Himalayas as the Mi-Go, or Abominable Snow Men.\n\nTo fight these beings the Old Ones attempted, for the first time\nsince their terrene advent, to sally forth again into the planetary\nether; but, despite all traditional preparations, found it no longer\npossible to leave the earth's atmosphere. Whatever the old secret of\ninterstellar travel had been, it was now definitely lost to the race.\n\nIn the end the Mi-Go drove the Old Ones out of all the northern lands,\nthough they were powerless to disturb those in the sea. Little by\nlittle the slow retreat of the elder race to their original antarctic\nhabitat was beginning.\n\nIt was curious to note from the pictured battles that both the Cthulhu\nspawn and the Mi-Go seem to have been composed of matter more widely\ndifferent from that which we know than was the substance of the Old\nOnes. They were able to undergo transformations and reintegrations\nimpossible for their adversaries, and seem therefore to have originally\ncome from even remoter gulfs of cosmic space.\n\nThe Old Ones, but for their abnormal toughness and peculiar vital\nproperties, were strictly material, and must have had their absolute\norigin within the known space-time continuum\u00e2\u0080\u0094whereas the first\nsources of the other beings can only be guessed at with bated breath.\nAll this, of course, assuming that the nonterrestrial linkages and\nthe anomalies ascribed to the invading foes are not pure mythology.\nConceivably, the Old Ones might have invented a cosmic framework\nto account for their occasional defeats, since historical interest\nand pride obviously formed their chief psychological element. It is\nsignificant that their annals failed to mention many advanced and\npotent races of beings whose mighty cultures and towering ethics figure\npersistently in certain obscure legends.\n\nThe changing state of the world through long geologic ages appeared\nwith startling vividness in many of the sculptured maps and scenes. In\ncertain cases existing science will require revision, while in other\ncases its bold deductions are magnificently confirmed.\n\nAs I have said, the hypothesis of Taylor, Wegener, and Joly that all\nthe continents are fragments of an original antarctic land mass which\ncracked from centrifugal force and drifted apart over a technically\nviscous lower surface\u00e2\u0080\u0094an hypothesis suggested by such things as the\ncomplimentary outlines of Africa and South America, and the way the\ngreat mountain chains are rolled and shoved up\u00e2\u0080\u0094receives striking\nsupport from this uncanny source.\n\nMaps evidently showing the Carboniferous of a hundred million or\nmore years ago displayed significant rifts and chasms destined later\nto separate Africa from the once continuous realms of Europe (then\nthe Valusia of primal legend), Asia, the Americas, and the antarctic\ncontinent.\n\nOther charts\u00e2\u0080\u0094and most significantly one in connection with the\nfounding fifty million years ago of the vast dead city around\nus\u00e2\u0080\u0094showed all the present continents well differentiated. And in\nthe latest discoverable specimen\u00e2\u0080\u0094dating perhaps from the Pliocene\nAge\u00e2\u0080\u0094the approximate world of to-day appeared quite clearly despite the\nlinkage of Alaska with Siberia, of North America with Europe through\nGreenland, and of South America with the antarctic continent through\nGraham Land.\n\nIn the Carboniferous map the whole globe\u00e2\u0080\u0094ocean floor and rifted land\nmass alike\u00e2\u0080\u0094bore symbols of the Old Ones' vast stone cities, but in the\nlater charts the gradual recession toward the antarctic became very\nplain.\n\nThe final Pliocene specimen showed no land cities except on the\nantarctic continent and the tip of South America, nor any ocean\ncities north of the fiftieth parallel of South Latitude. Knowledge\nand interest in the northern world, save for a study of coast lines\nprobably made during long exploration flights on those fan-like\nmembranous wings, had evidently declined to zero among the Old Ones.\n\nDestruction of cities through the up-thrust of mountains, the\ncentrifugal rending of continents, the seismic convulsions of land or\nsea bottom, and other natural causes was a matter of common record; and\nit was curious to observe how fewer and fewer replacements were made as\nthe ages wore on.\n\nThe vast dead megalopolis that yawned around us seemed to be the last\ngeneral center of the race\u00e2\u0080\u0094built early in the Cretaceous Age after a\ntitanic earth buckling had obliterated a still vaster predecessor not\nfar distant.\n\nIt appeared that this general region was the most sacred spot of\nall, where reputedly the first Old Ones had settled on a primal sea\nbottom. In the new city\u00e2\u0080\u0094many of whose features we could recognize\nin the sculptures, but which stretched fully a hundred miles along\nthe mountain range in each direction beyond the farthest limits of\nour a\u00c3\u00abrial survey\u00e2\u0080\u0094there were reputed to be preserved certain sacred\nstones forming part of the first sea-bottom city, which were thrust up\nto light after long epochs in the course of the general crumpling of\nstrata.\n\nVIII.\n\nNaturally, Danforth and I studied with special interest and a\npeculiarly personal sense of awe everything pertaining to the immediate\ndistrict in which we were. Of this local material there was naturally a\nvast abundance.\n\nOn the tangled ground level of the city we were lucky enough to find\na house of very late date whose walls, though somewhat damaged by a\nneighboring rift, contained sculptures of decadent workmanship carrying\nthe story of the region, much beyond the Pliocene map, whence we\nderived our last general glimpse of the prehuman world. This was the\nlast place we examined in detail, since what we found there set upon us\na fresh, immediate objective.\n\nCertainly, we were in one of the strangest, weirdest, and most terrible\nof all the corners of earth's globe. Of all existing lands it was\ninfinitely the most ancient. The conviction grew upon us that this\nhideous upland must indeed be the fabled nightmare plateau of Leng\nwhich even the mad author of the Necronomicon was reluctant to\ndiscuss.\n\nThe great mountain chain was tremendously long\u00e2\u0080\u0094starting as a low range\nat Luitpold Land on the coast of Weddell Sea and virtually crossing the\nentire continent. The really high part stretched in a mighty arc from\nabout Latitude 82\u00c2\u00b0, E. Longitude 60\u00c2\u00b0 to Latitude 70\u00c2\u00b0, East Longitude\n115\u00c2\u00b0, with its concave side toward our camp and its seaward end in the\nregion of that long, ice-locked coast whose hills were glimpsed by\nWilkes and Mawson at the antarctic circle.\n\nYet even more monstrous exaggerations of nature seemed disturbingly\nclose at hand. I have said that these peaks are higher than the\nHimalayas, but the sculptures forbid me to say that they are earth's\nhighest. That grim honor is beyond doubt reserved for something\nwhich half the sculptures hesitated to record at all, whilst others\napproached it with obvious repugnance and trepidation.\n\nIt seems that there was one part of the ancient land\u00e2\u0080\u0094the first part\nthat ever rose from the waters after the earth had flung off the moon\nand the Old Ones had seeped down from the stars\u00e2\u0080\u0094which had come to be\nshunned as vaguely and namelessly evil. Cities built there had crumbled\nbefore their time, and had been found suddenly deserted.\n\nThen when the first great earth buckling had convulsed the region in\nthe Comanchean Age, a frightful line of peaks had shot suddenly up\namidst the most appalling din and chaos\u00e2\u0080\u0094and earth had received her\nloftiest and most terrible mountains.\n\nIf the scale of the carvings was correct, these abhorred things must\nhave been much over forty thousand feet high\u00e2\u0080\u0094radically vaster than\neven the shocking mountains of madness we had crossed. They extended,\nit appeared, from about Latitude 77\u00c2\u00b0, E. Longitude 70\u00c2\u00b0 to Latitude 70\u00c2\u00b0,\nE. Longitude 100\u00c2\u00b0\u00e2\u0080\u0094less than three hundred miles away from the dead\ncity, so that we would have spied their dreaded summits in the dim\nwestern distance had it not been for that vague, opalescent haze. Their\nnorthern end must likewise be visible from the long antarctic circle\ncoast line at Queen Mary Land.\n\nSome of the Old Ones, in the decadent days, had made strange prayers\nto those mountains\u00e2\u0080\u0094but none ever went near them or dared to guess\nwhat lay beyond. No human eye had ever seen them, and as I studied the\nemotions conveyed in the carvings I prayed that none ever might.\n\nThere are protecting hills along the coast beyond them\u00e2\u0080\u0094Queen Mary and\nKaiser Wilhelm Lands\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I thank Heaven no one has been able to land\nand climb those hills. I am not as sceptical about old tales and fears\nas I used to be, and I do not laugh now at the prehuman sculptor's\nnotion that lightning paused meaningfully now and then at each of the\nbrooding crests, and that an unexplained glow shone from one of those\nterrible pinnacles all through the long polar night. There may be a\nvery real and very monstrous meaning in the old Pnakotic whispers about\nKadath in the Cold Waste.\n\nBut the terrain close at hand was hardly less strange, even if less\nnamelessly accursed. Soon after the founding of the city the great\nmountain range became the seat of the principal temples, and many\ncarvings showed what grotesque and fantastic towers had pierced the sky\nwhere now we saw only the curiously clinging cubes and ramparts.\n\nIn the course of ages the caves had appeared, and had been shaped into\nadjuncts of the temples. With the advance of still later epochs all\nthe limestone veins of the region were hollowed out by ground waters,\nso that the mountains, the foothills, and the plains below them were\na veritable network of connected caverns and galleries. Many graphic\nsculptures told of explorations deep underground, and of the final\ndiscovery of the Stygian sunless sea that lurked at earth's bowels.\n\nThis vast nighted gulf had undoubtedly been worn by the great river\nwhich flowed down from the nameless and horrible westward mountains,\nand which had formerly turned at the base of the Old Ones' range and\nflowed beside that chain into the Indian Ocean between Budd and Totten\nLands on Wilkes's coast line. Little by little it had eaten away the\nlimestone hill base at its turning, till at last its sapping currents\nreached the caverns of the ground waters and joined with them in\ndigging a deeper abyss.\n\nFinally its whole bulk emptied into the hollow hills and left the old\nbed toward the ocean dry. Much of the later city as we now found it\nhad been built over that former bed. The Old Ones, understanding what\nhad happened, and exercising their always keen artistic sense, had\ncarved into ornate pylons those headlands of the foothills where the\ngreat stream began its descent into eternal darkness.\n\nThis river, once crossed by scores of noble stone bridges, was plainly\nthe one whose extinct course we had seen in our a\u00c3\u00abroplane survey.\nIts position in different carvings of the city helped us to orient\nourselves to the scene as it had been at various stages of the region's\nage-long, \u00c3\u00a6on-dead history, so that we were able to sketch a hasty but\ncareful map of the salient features\u00e2\u0080\u0094squares, important buildings, and\nthe like\u00e2\u0080\u0094for guidance in further explorations.\n\nWe could soon reconstruct in fancy the whole stupendous thing as it was\na million or ten million or fifty million years ago, for the sculptures\ntold us exactly what the buildings and mountains and squares and\nsuburbs and landscape setting and luxuriant Tertiary vegetation had\nlooked like.\n\nIt must have had a marvelous and mystic beauty, and as I thought of\nit I almost forgot the clammy sense of sinister oppression with which\nthe city's inhuman age and massiveness and deadness and remoteness and\nglacial twilight had choked and weighed on my spirit.\n\nYet, according to certain carvings the denizens of that city had\nthemselves known the clutch of oppressive terror; for there was a\nsomber and recurrent type of scene in which the Old Ones were shown in\nthe act of recoiling affrightedly from some object\u00e2\u0080\u0094never allowed to\nappear in the design\u00e2\u0080\u0094found in the great river and indicated as having\nbeen washed down through waving, vine-draped cycad forests from those\nhorrible westward mountains.\n\nIt was only in the one late-built house with the decadent carvings that\nwe obtained any foreshadowing of the final calamity leading to the\ncity's desertion. Undoubtedly there must have been many sculptures of\nthe same age elsewhere, even allowing for the slackened energies and\naspirations of a stressful and uncertain period; indeed, very certain\nevidence of the existence of others came to us shortly afterward. But\nthis was the first and only set we directly encountered.\n\nWe meant to look farther later on; but as I have said, immediate\nconditions dictated another present objective. There would, though,\nhave been a limit\u00e2\u0080\u0094for after all hope of a long future occupancy of the\nplace had perished among the Old Ones, there could not but have been a\ncomplete cessation of mural decoration. The ultimate blow, of course,\nwas the coming of the great cold which once held most of the earth in\nthrall, and which has never departed from the ill-fated poles\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\ngreat cold that, at the world's other extremity, put an end to the\nfabled lands of Lomar and Hyperborea.\n\nJust when this tendency began in the antarctic it would be hard to say\nin terms of exact years. Nowadays we set the beginning of the general\nglacial periods at a distance of about five hundred thousand years from\nthe present, but at the poles the terrible scourge must have commenced\nmuch earlier. All quantitative estimates are partly guesswork, but it\nis quite likely that the decadent sculptures were made considerably\nless than a million years ago, and that the actual desertion of\nthe city was complete long before the conventional opening of the\nPleistocene\u00e2\u0080\u0094five hundred thousand years ago\u00e2\u0080\u0094as reckoned in terms of\nthe earth's whole surface.\n\nIn the decadent sculptures there were signs of thinner vegetation\neverywhere, and of a decreased country life on the part of the Old\nOnes. Heating devices were shown in the houses, and winter travelers\nwere represented as muffled in protective fabrics. Then we saw a\nseries of cartouches\u00e2\u0080\u0094the continuous band arrangement being frequently\ninterrupted in these late carvings\u00e2\u0080\u0094depicting a constantly growing\nmigration to the nearest refuges of greater warmth\u00e2\u0080\u0094some fleeing to\ncities under the sea off the far-away coast, and some clambering down\nthrough networks of limestone caverns in the hollow hills to the\nneighboring black abyss of subterrane waters.\n\nIn the end, it seems to have been the neighboring abyss which received\nthe greatest colonization. This was partly due, no doubt, to the\ntraditional sacredness of this special region, but may have been more\nconclusively determined by the opportunities it gave for continuing\nthe use of the great temples on the honeycombed mountains, and for\nretaining the vast land city as a place of summer residence and base of\ncommunication with various mines.\n\nThe linkage of old and new abodes was made more effective by means\nof several gradings and improvements along the connecting routes,\nincluding the chiseling of numerous direct tunnels from the ancient\nmetropolis to the black abyss\u00e2\u0080\u0094sharply down-pointing tunnels whose\nmouths we carefully drew, according to our most thoughtful estimates,\non the guide map we were compiling.\n\nIt was obvious that at least two of these tunnels lay within a\nreasonable exploring distance of where we were\u00e2\u0080\u0094both being on the\nmountainward edge of the city, one less than a quarter of a mile toward\nthe ancient rivercourse, and the other perhaps twice that distance in\nthe opposite direction.\n\nThe abyss, it seems, had shelving shores of dry land at certain places,\nbut the Old Ones built their new city under water\u00e2\u0080\u0094no doubt because of\nits greater certainty of uniform warmth. The depth of the hidden sea\nappears to have been very great, so that the earth's internal heat\ncould insure its habitability for an indefinite period.\n\nThe beings seem to have had no trouble in adapting themselves to\npart-time\u00e2\u0080\u0094and eventually, of course, whole-time\u00e2\u0080\u0094residence under\nwater, since they had never allowed their gill systems to atrophy.\n\nThere were many sculptures which showed how they had always frequently\nvisited their submarine kinsfolk elsewhere, and how they had habitually\nbathed on the deep bottom of their great river. The darkness of inner\nearth could likewise have been no deterrent to a race accustomed to\nlong antarctic nights.\n\nDecadent though their style undoubtedly was, these latest carvings\nhad a truly epic quality where they told of the building of\nthe new city in the cavern sea. The Old Ones had gone about it\nscientifically\u00e2\u0080\u0094quarrying insoluble rocks from the heart of the\nhoneycombed mountains, and employing expert workers from the nearest\nsubmarine city to perform the construction according to the best\nmethods.\n\nThese workers brought with them all that was necessary to establish\nthe new venture\u00e2\u0080\u0094Shoggoth tissue from which to breed stone lifters and\nsubsequent beasts of burden for the cavern city, and other protoplasmic\nmatter to mold into phosphorescent organisms for lighting purposes.\n\nAt last a mighty metropolis rose on the bottom of that Stygian sea,\nits architecture much like that of the city above, and its workmanship\ndisplaying relatively little decadence because of the precise\nmathematical element inherent in building operations.\n\nThe newly bred Shoggoths grew to enormous size and singular\nintelligence, and were represented as taking and executing orders with\nmarvelous quickness. They seemed to converse with the Old Ones by\nmimicking their voices\u00e2\u0080\u0094a sort of musical piping over a wide range,\nif poor Lake's dissection had indicated aright\u00e2\u0080\u0094and to work more from\nspoken commands than from hypnotic suggestions as in earlier times.\n\nThey were, however, kept in admirable control. The phosphorescent\norganisms supplied light with vast effectiveness, and doubtless atoned\nfor the loss of the familiar polar auroras of the outer-world night.\n\nArt and decoration were pursued, though, of course, with a certain\ndecadence. The Old Ones seemed to realize this falling off themselves,\nand in many cases anticipated the policy of Constantine the Great by\ntransplanting especially fine blocks of ancient carving from their\nland city, just as the emperor, in a similar age of decline, stripped\nGreece and Asia of their finest art to give his new Byzantine capital\ngreater splendors than its own people could create. That the transfer\nof sculptured blocks had not been more extensive, was doubtless owing\nto the fact that the land city was not at first wholly abandoned.\n\nBy the time total abandonment did occur\u00e2\u0080\u0094and it surely must have\noccurred before the polar Pleistocene was far advanced\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Old Ones\nhad perhaps become satisfied with their decadent art\u00e2\u0080\u0094or had ceased\nto recognize the superior merit of the older carvings. At any rate,\nthe \u00c3\u00a6on-silent ruins around us had certainly undergone no wholesale\nsculptural denudation, though all the best separate statues, like other\nmovables, had been taken away.\n\nThe decadent cartouches and dados telling this story were, as I have\nsaid, the latest we could find in our limited search. They left us with\na picture of the Old Ones shuttling back and forth betwixt the land\ncity in summer and the sea-cavern city in winter, and sometimes trading\nwith the sea-bottom cities off the antarctic coast.\n\nBy this time the ultimate doom of the land city must have been\nrecognized, for the sculptures showed many signs of the cold's malign\nencroachments. Vegetation was declining, and the terrible snows of the\nwinter no longer melted completely even in midsummer.\n\nThe saurian live stock were nearly all dead, and the mammals were\nstanding it none too well. To keep on with the work of the upper\nworld it had become necessary to adapt some of the amorphous and\ncuriously cold-resistant Shoggoths to land life\u00e2\u0080\u0094a thing the Old Ones\nhad formerly been reluctant to do. The great river was now lifeless,\nand the upper sea had lost most of its denizens except the seals and\nwhales. All the birds had flown away, save only the great, grotesque\npenguins.\n\nWhat had happened afterward we could only guess. How long had the new\nsea-cavern city survived? Was it still down there, a stony corpse in\neternal blackness? Had the subterranean waters frozen at last? To what\nfate had the ocean-bottom cities of the outer world been delivered?\nHad any of the Old Ones shifted north ahead of the creeping ice cap?\nExisting geology shows no trace of their presence. Had the frightful\nMi-Go been still a menace in the outer land world of the north? Could\none be sure of what might or might not linger, even to this day, in the\nlightless and unplumbed abysses of earth's deepest water?\n\nThose things had seemingly been able to withstand any amount of\npressure\u00e2\u0080\u0094and men of the sea have fished up curious objects at\ntimes. And has the killer-whale theory really explained the savage\nand mysterious scars on antarctic seals noticed a generation ago by\nBorchgrevingk?\n\nThe specimens found by poor Lake did not enter into these guesses, for\ntheir geologic setting proved them to have lived at what must have been\na very early date in the land city's history. They were, according to\ntheir location, certainly not less than thirty million years old, and\nwe reflected that in their day the sea-cavern city, and indeed the\ncavern itself, had had no existence.\n\nThey would have remembered an older scene, with lush Tertiary\nvegetation everywhere, a younger land city of flourishing arts around\nthem, and a great river sweeping northward along the base of the mighty\nmountains toward a far-away tropic ocean.\n\nAnd yet we could not help thinking about these specimens\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially\nabout the eight perfect ones that were missing from Lake's hideously\nravaged camp. There was something abnormal about that whole\nbusiness\u00e2\u0080\u0094the strange things we had tried so hard to lay to somebody's\nmadness\u00e2\u0080\u0094those frightful graves\u00e2\u0080\u0094the amount and nature of the\nmissing material\u00e2\u0080\u0094Gedney\u00e2\u0080\u0094the unearthly toughness of those archaic\nmonstrosities, and the queer vital freaks the sculptures now showed\nthe race to have\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094Danforth and I had seen a good deal in the last\nfew hours, and were prepared to believe and keep silent about many\nappalling and incredible secrets of primal nature.\n\nIX.\n\nI have said that our study of the decadent sculptures brought about a\nchange in our immediate objective. This, of course, had to do with the\nchiseled avenues to the black inner world, of whose existence we had\nnot known before, but which we were now eager to find and traverse.\n\nFrom the evident scale of the carvings we deduced that a steeply\ndescending walk of about a mile through either of the neighboring\ntunnels would bring us to the brink of the dizzy, sunless cliffs about\nthe great abyss, down whose side paths, improved by the Old Ones, led\nto the rocky shore of the hidden and nighted ocean. To behold this\nfabulous gulf in stark reality was a lure which seemed impossible of\nresistance once we knew of the thing\u00e2\u0080\u0094yet we realized we must begin the\nquest at once if we expected to include it in our present trip.\n\nIn was now eight p.m., and we had not enough battery replacements to\nlet our torches burn on forever. We had done so much of our studying\nand copying below the glacial level that our battery supply had had at\nleast five hours of nearly continuous use, and despite the special dry\ncell formula would obviously be good for only about four more\u00e2\u0080\u0094though\nby keeping one torch unused, except for especially interesting or\ndifficult places, we might manage to eke out a safe margin beyond that.\n\nIt would not do to be without a light in these Cyclopean catacombs,\nhence in order to make the abyss trip we must give up all further\nmural deciphering. Of course, we intended to revisit the place for days\nand perhaps weeks of intensive study and photography\u00e2\u0080\u0094curiosity having\nlong ago gotten the better of horror\u00e2\u0080\u0094but just now we must hasten.\n\nOur supply of trail-blazing paper was far from unlimited, and we were\nreluctant to sacrifice spare notebooks or sketching paper to augment\nit, but we did let one large notebook go. If worst came to worst, we\ncould resort to rock chipping\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, of course, it would be possible,\neven in case of really lost direction, to work up to full daylight by\none channel or another if granted sufficient time for plentiful trial\nand error. So, at last, we set off eagerly in the indicated direction\nof the nearest tunnel.\n\nAccording to the carvings from which we had made our map, the desired\ntunnel mouth could not be much more than a quarter of a mile from where\nwe stood; the intervening space showing solid-looking buildings quite\nlikely to be penetrable still at a subglacial level. The opening itself\nwould be in the basement\u00e2\u0080\u0094on the angle nearest the foothills\u00e2\u0080\u0094of a\nvast five-pointed structure of evidently public and perhaps ceremonial\nnature, which we tried to identify from our a\u00c3\u00abrial survey of the ruins.\n\nNo such structure came to our minds as we recalled our flight, hence we\nconcluded that its upper parts had been greatly damaged, or that it had\nbeen totally shattered in an ice rift we had noticed. In the latter\ncase the tunnel would probably turn out to be choked, so that we would\nhave to try the next nearest one\u00e2\u0080\u0094the one less than a mile to the north.\n\nThe intervening river course prevented our trying any of the more\nsouthern tunnels on this trip; and indeed, if both of the neighboring\nones were choked it was doubtful whether our batteries would warrant\nan attempt on the next northerly one\u00e2\u0080\u0094about a mile beyond our second\nchoice.\n\nAs we threaded our dim way through the labyrinth with the aid of map\nand compass\u00e2\u0080\u0094traversing rooms and corridors in every stage of ruin or\npreservation, clambering up ramps, crossing upper floors and bridges\nand clambering down again, encountering choked doorways and piles of\nd\u00c3\u00a9bris, hastening now and then along finely preserved and uncannily\nimmaculate stretches, taking false leads and retracing our way (in such\ncases removing the blind paper trail we had left), and once in a while\nstriking the bottom of an open shaft through which daylight poured or\ntrickled down\u00e2\u0080\u0094we were repeatedly tantalized by the sculptured walls\nalong our route.\n\nWe had wormed our way very close to the computed site of the tunnel's\nmouth\u00e2\u0080\u0094having crossed a second-story bridge to what seemed plainly the\ntip of a pointed wall, and descended to a ruinous corridor especially\nrich in decadently elaborate and apparently ritualistic sculptures of\nlate workmanship\u00e2\u0080\u0094when, about eight thirty p.m., Danforth's keen young\nnostrils gave us the first hint of something unusual.\n\nIf we had had a dog with us, I suppost we would have been warned\nbefore. At first we could not precisely say what was wrong with the\nformerly crystal-pure air, but after a few seconds our memories reached\nonly too definitely. Let me try to state the thing without flinching.\nThere was an odor\u00e2\u0080\u0094and that odor was vaguely, subtly, and unmistakably\nakin to what had nauseated us upon opening the insane grave of the\nhorror poor Lake had dissected.\n\nOf course, the revelation was not as clearly cut at the time as it\nsounds now. There were several conceivable explanations, and we did a\ngood deal of indecisive whispering. Most important of all, we did not\nretreat without further investigation; for having come this far, we\nwere loath to be balked by anything short of certain disaster.\n\nAnyway, what we must have suspected was altogether too wild to believe.\nSuch things did not happen in any normal world. It was probably sheer\nirrational instinct which made us dim our single torch\u00e2\u0080\u0094tempted no\nlonger by the decadent and sinister sculptures that leered menacingly\nfrom the oppressive walls\u00e2\u0080\u0094and which softened our progress to a\ncautious tiptoeing and crawling over the increasingly littered floor\nand heaps of d\u00c3\u00a9bris.\n\nDanforth's eyes as well as nose proved better than mine, for it was\nlikewise he who first noticed the queer aspect of the d\u00c3\u00a9bris after we\nhad passed many half-choked arches leading to chambers and corridors\non the ground level. It did not look quite as it ought after countless\nthousands of years of desertion, and when we cautiously turned on more\nlight we saw that a kind of swath seemed to have been lately tracked\nthrough it. The irregular nature of the latter precluded any definite\nmarks, but in the smoother places there were suggestions of the\ndragging of heavy objects. Once we thought there was a hint of parallel\ntracks, as if of runners. This was what made us pause again.\n\nIt was during that pause that we caught\u00e2\u0080\u0094simultaneously this time\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\nother odor ahead. Paradoxically, it was both a less frightful and a\nmore frightful odor\u00e2\u0080\u0094less frightful intrinsically, but infinitely\nappalling in this place under the known circumstances\u00e2\u0080\u0094unless, of\ncourse, Gedney\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094For the odor was the plain and familiar one of common\npetrol\u00e2\u0080\u0094every-day gasoline.\n\nOur motivation after that is something I will leave to psychologists.\nWe knew now that some terrible extension of the camp horrors must\nhave crawled into this nighted burial place of the \u00c3\u00a6ons, hence could\nnot doubt any longer the existence of nameless conditions\u00e2\u0080\u0094present\nor at least recent\u00e2\u0080\u0094just ahead. Yet in the end we did let sheer\nburning curiosity\u00e2\u0080\u0094or anxiety\u00e2\u0080\u0094or autohypnotism\u00e2\u0080\u0094or vague thoughts of\nresponsibility toward Gedney\u00e2\u0080\u0094of what not\u00e2\u0080\u0094drive us on.\n\nDanforth whispered again of the print he thought he had seen at\nthe alley turning in the ruins above; and of the faint musical\npiping\u00e2\u0080\u0094potentially of tremendous significance in the light of Lake's\ndissection report, despite its close resemblance to the cave-mouth\nechoes of the windy peaks\u00e2\u0080\u0094which he thought he had shortly afterward\nhalf heard from unknown depths below.\n\nI, in my turn, whispered of how the camp was left\u00e2\u0080\u0094of what had\ndisappeared, and of how the madness of a lone survivor might have\nconceived the inconceivable\u00e2\u0080\u0094a wild trip across the monstrous mountains\nand a descent into the unknown, primal masonry\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nBut we could not convince each other, or even ourselves, of anything\ndefinite. We had turned off all light as we stood still, and vaguely\nnoticed that a trace of deeply filtered upper daylight kept the\nblackness from being absolute.\n\nHaving automatically begun to move ahead, we guided ourselves by\noccasional flashes from our torch. The disturbed d\u00c3\u00a9bris formed an\nimpression we could not shake off, and the smell of gasoline grew\nstronger. More and more ruin met our eyes and hampered our feet, until\nvery soon we saw that the forward way was about to cease. We had been\nall too correct in our pessimistic guess about that rift glimpsed from\nthe air. Our tunnel quest was a blind one, and we were not even going\nto be able to reach the basement out of which the abyssward aperture\nopened.\n\nThe torch, flashing over the grotesquely carved walls of the blocked\ncorridor in which we stood, showed several doorways in various\nstates of obstruction; and from one of them the gasoline odor\u00e2\u0080\u0094quite\nsubmerging that other hint of odor\u00e2\u0080\u0094came with especial distinctness. As\nwe looked more steadily, we saw that beyond a doubt there had been a\nslight and recent clearing away of d\u00c3\u00a9bris from that particular opening.\nWhatever the lurking horror might be, we believed the direct avenue\ntoward it was now plainly manifest. I do not think any one will wonder\nthat we waited an appreciable time before making any further motion.\n\nAnd yet, when we did venture inside that black arch, our first\nimpression was one of anticlimax. For amidst the littered expanse\nof that sculptured crypt\u00e2\u0080\u0094a perfect cube with sides of about twenty\nfeet\u00e2\u0080\u0094there remained no recent object of instantly discernible size; so\nthat we looked instinctively, though in vain, for a farther doorway.\n\nIn another moment, however, Danforth's sharp vision had discovered a\nplace where the floor d\u00c3\u00a9bris had been disturbed. We turned on both\ntorches full strength. Though what we saw in that light was actually\nsimple and trifling, I am none the less reluctant to tell of it because\nof what it implied.\n\nIt was a rough leveling of the d\u00c3\u00a9bris, upon which several small objects\nlay carelessly scattered, and at one corner of which a considerable\namount of gasoline must have been spilled lately enough to leave a\nstrong odor even at this extreme superplateau altitude. In other words,\nit could not be other than a sort of camp\u00e2\u0080\u0094a camp made by questing\nbeings who, like us, had been turned back by the unexpectedly choked\nway to the abyss.\n\nLet me be plain. The scattered objects were, so far as substance was\nconcerned, all from Lake's camp, and consisted of: tin cans as queerly\nopened as those we had seen at that ravaged place, many spent matches,\nthree illustrated books more or less curiously smudged, an empty ink\nbottle with its pictorial and instructional carton, a broken fountain\npen, some oddly snipped fragments of fur and tent cloth, a used\nelectric battery with circular of directions, a folder that came with\nour type of tent heater, and a sprinkling of crumpled papers.\n\nIt was all bad enough, but when we smoothed out the papers and looked\nat what was on them we felt we had come to the worst. We had found\ncertain inexplicably blotted papers at the camp which might have\nprepared us, yet the effect of the sight, down there in the prehuman\nvaults of a nightmare city, was almost too much to bear.\n\nA mad Gedney might have made the groups of dots in imitation of\nthose found on the greenish soapstones, just as the dots on those\ninsane five-pointed grave mounds might have been made; and he might\nconceivably have prepared rough, hasty sketches\u00e2\u0080\u0094varying in their\naccuracy\u00e2\u0080\u0094or lack of it\u00e2\u0080\u0094which outlined the neighboring parts of the\ncity and traced the way from a circularly represented place outside\nour previous route\u00e2\u0080\u0094a place we identified as a great cylindrical tower\nin the carvings and as a vast circular gulf glimpsed in our a\u00c3\u00abrial\nsurvey\u00e2\u0080\u0094to the present five-pointed structure and the tunnel mouth\ntherein.\n\nHe might, I repeat, have prepared such sketches; for those before\nus were quite obviously compiled, as our own had been, from late\nsculptures somewhere in the glacial labyrinth, though not from the\nones which we had seen and used. But what this art-blind bungler could\nnever have done was to execute those sketches in a strange and assured\ntechnique perhaps superior, despite haste and carelessness, to any of\nthe decadent carvings from which they were taken\u00e2\u0080\u0094the characteristic\nand unmistakable technique of the Old Ones themselves in the dead\ncity's heyday.\n\nThere are those who will say Danforth and I were utterly mad not\nto flee for our lives after that; since our conclusions were\nnow\u00e2\u0080\u0094notwithstanding their wildness\u00e2\u0080\u0094completely fixed, and of a nature\nI need not even mention to those who have read my account as far as\nthis. Perhaps we were mad\u00e2\u0080\u0094for have I not said those horrible peaks\nwere mountains of madness? But I think I can detect something of the\nsame spirit\u00e2\u0080\u0094albeit in a less extreme form\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the men who stalk\ndeadly beasts through African jungles to photograph them or study\ntheir habits. Half paralyzed with terror though we were, there was\nnevertheless fanned within us a blazing flame of awe and curiosity\nwhich triumphed in the end.\n\nOf course, we did not mean to face that\u00e2\u0080\u0094or those\u00e2\u0080\u0094which we knew had\nbeen there, but we felt that they must be gone by now. They would by\nthis time have found the other neighboring entrance to the abyss, and\nhave passed within, to whatever night-black fragments of the past might\nawait them in the ultimate gulf\u00e2\u0080\u0094the ultimate gulf they had never seen.\nOr if that entrance, too, was blocked, they would have gone on to the\nnorth seeking another. They were, we remembered, partly independent of\nlight.\n\nLooking back to that moment, I can scarcely recall just what precise\nform our new emotions took\u00e2\u0080\u0094just what change of immediate objective it\nwas that so sharpened our sense of expectancy. We certainly did not\nmean to face what we feared\u00e2\u0080\u0094yet I will not deny that we may have had\na lurking, unconscious wish to spy certain things from some hidden\nvantage point.\n\nProbably we had not given up our zeal to glimpse the abyss itself,\nthough there was interposed a new goal in the form of that great\ncircular place shown on the crumpled sketches we had found. We had at\nonce recognized it as a monstrous cylindrical tower in the carvings,\nbut appearing only as a prodigious, round aperture from above.\n\nSomething about the impressiveness of its rendering, even in these\nhasty diagrams, made us think that its subglacial levels must\nstill form a feature of peculiar importance. Perhaps it embodied\narchitectural marvels as yet unencountered by us. It was certainly of\nincredible age, according to the sculptures in which it figured\u00e2\u0080\u0094being\nindeed among the first things built in the city. Its carvings, if\npreserved, could not but be highly significant. Moreover, it might form\na good present link with the upper world\u00e2\u0080\u0094a shorter route than the one\nwe were so carefully blazing and probably that by which those others\nhad descended.\n\nAt any rate, the thing we did was to study the terrible sketches\u00e2\u0080\u0094which\nquite perfectly confirmed our own\u00e2\u0080\u0094and start back over the indicated\ncourse to the circular place; the course which our nameless\npredecessors must have traversed twice before us. The other neighboring\ngate to the abyss would lie beyond that. I need not speak of our\njourney\u00e2\u0080\u0094during which we continued to leave an economical trail of\npaper\u00e2\u0080\u0094for it was precisely the same in kind as that by which we had\nreached the cul-de-sac, except that it tended to adhere more closely to\nthe ground level and even descend to basement corridors.\n\nEvery now and then we could trace certain disturbing marks\nin the d\u00c3\u00a9bris or litter underfoot; and, after we had passed\noutside the radius of the gasoline scent, we were again faintly\nconscious\u00e2\u0080\u0094spasmodically\u00e2\u0080\u0094of that more hideous and more persistent\nscent. After the way had branched from our former course, we sometimes\ngave the rays of our single torch a furtive sweep along the walls;\nnoting in almost every case the well-nigh omnipresent sculptures, which\nindeed seem to have formed a main \u00c3\u00a6sthetic outlet for the Old Ones.\n\nAbout nine-thirty p.m., while traversing a vaulted corridor whose\nincreasingly glaciated floor seemed somewhat below the ground level and\nwhose roof grew lower as we advanced, we began to see strong daylight\nahead and were able to turn off our torch. It appeared that we were\ncoming to the vast, circular place, and that our distance from the\nupper air could not be very great.\n\nThe corridor ended in an arch, surprisingly low for these megalithic\nruins, but we could see much through it even before we emerged. Beyond,\nthere stretched a prodigious round space\u00e2\u0080\u0094fully two hundred feet in\ndiameter\u00e2\u0080\u0094strewn with d\u00c3\u00a9bris and containing many choked archways\ncorresponding to the one we were about to cross. The walls were\u00e2\u0080\u0094in\navailable spaces\u00e2\u0080\u0094boldly sculptured into a spiral band of heroic\nproportions; and displayed, despite the destructive weathering caused\nby the openness of the spot, an artistic splendor far beyond anything\nwe had encountered before. The littered floor was quite heavily\nglaciated, and we fancied that the true bottom lay at a considerably\nlower depth.\n\nBut the salient object of the place was the titanic stone ramp which,\neluding the archways by a sharp turn outward into the open floor, wound\nspirally up the stupendous cylindrical wall like an inside counterpart\nof those once climbing outside the monstrous towers or zikkurats of\nantique Babylon. Only the rapidity of our flight, and the perspective\nwhich confounded the descent with the tower's inner wall, had\nprevented our noticing this feature from the air, and thus caused us to\nseek another avenue to the subglacial level.\n\nPabodie might have been able to tell what sort of engineering held it\nin place, but Danforth and I could merely admire and marvel. We could\nsee mighty stone corbels and pillars here and there, but what we saw\nseemed inadequate to the function performed. The thing was excellently\npreserved up to the present top of the tower\u00e2\u0080\u0094a highly remarkable\ncircumstance in view of its exposure\u00e2\u0080\u0094and its shelter had done much to\nprotect the bizarre and disturbing cosmic sculptures on the walls.\n\nAs we stepped out into the awesome half daylight of this monstrous\ncylinder bottom\u00e2\u0080\u0094fifty million years old, and without doubt the most\nprimally ancient structure ever to meet our eyes\u00e2\u0080\u0094we saw that the\nramp-traversed sides stretched dizzily up to a height of fully sixty\nfeet.\n\nThis, we recalled from our a\u00c3\u00abrial survey, meant an outside glaciation\nof some forty feet; since the yawning gulf we had seen from the plane\nhad been at the top of an approximately twenty-foot mound of crumbled\nmasonry, somewhat sheltered for three fourths of its circumference by\nthe massive curving walls of a line of higher ruins. According to the\nsculptures the original tower had stood in the center of an immense\ncircular plaza, and had been perhaps five hundred or six hundred\nfeet high, with tiers of horizontal disks near the top, and a row of\nneedlelike spires along the upper rim.\n\nMost of the masonry had obviously toppled outward rather than inward\u00e2\u0080\u0094a\nfortunate happening, since otherwise the ramp might have been shattered\nand the whole interior choked. As it was, the ramp showed sad\nbattering; whilst the choking was such that all the archways seemed to\nhave been half cleared.\n\nIt took us only a moment to conclude that this was indeed the route by\nwhich those others had descended, and that this would be the logical\nroute for our own ascent, despite the long trail of paper we had left\nelsewhere. The tower's mouth was no farther from the foothills and our\nwaiting plane than was the great terraced building we had entered, and\nany further subglacial exploration we might make on this trip would lie\nin this general region.\n\nOddly, we were still thinking about possible later trips\u00e2\u0080\u0094even after\nall we had seen and guessed. Then, as we picked our way cautiously over\nthe d\u00c3\u00a9bris of the great floor, there came a sight which for the time\nexcluded all other matters.\n\nIt was the neatly huddled array of three sledges in that farther angle\nof the ramp's lower and outward-projecting course which had hitherto\nbeen screened from our view. There they were\u00e2\u0080\u0094the three sledges missing\nfrom Lake's camp\u00e2\u0080\u0094shaken by a hard usage which must have included\nforcible dragging along great reaches of snowless masonry and d\u00c3\u00a9bris,\nas well as much hand portage over utterly unnavigable places.\n\nThey were carefully and intelligently packed and strapped, and\ncontained things memorably familiar enough: the gasoline stove, fuel\ncans, instrument cases, provision tins, tarpaulins obviously bulging\nwith books, and some bulging with less obvious contents\u00e2\u0080\u0094everything\nderived from Lake's equipment.\n\nAfter what we had found in that other room, we were in a measure\nprepared for this encounter. The really great shock came when we\nstepped over and undid one tarpaulin, whose outlines had peculiarly\ndisquieted us. It seems that others as well as Lake had been interested\nin collecting typical specimens; for there were two here, both stiffly\nfrozen, perfectly preserved, patched with adhesive plaster where some\nwounds around the neck had occurred, and wrapped with care to prevent\nfurther damage. They were the bodies of young Gedney and the missing\ndog.\n\nX.\n\nMany people will probably judge us callous as well as mad for thinking\nabout the northward tunnel and the abyss so soon after our somber\ndiscovery, and I am not prepared to say that we would have immediately\nrevived such thoughts but for a specific circumstance which broke in\nupon us and set up a whole new train of speculations.\n\nWe had replaced the tarpaulin over poor Gedney and were standing\nin a kind of mute bewilderment when the sounds finally reached our\nconsciousness\u00e2\u0080\u0094the first sounds we had heard since descending out of\nthe open where the mountain wind whined faintly from its unearthly\nheights. Well-known and mundane though they were, their presence in\nthis remote world of death was more unexpected and unnerving than any\ngrotesque or fabulous tones could possibly have been\u00e2\u0080\u0094since they gave a\nfresh upsetting to all our notions of cosmic harmony.\n\nHad it been some trace of that bizarre musical piping over a wide\nrange, which Lake's dissection report had led us to expect in those\nothers\u00e2\u0080\u0094and which, indeed, our overwrought fancies had been reading\ninto every wind howl we had heard since coming on the camp horror\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\nwould have had a kind of hellish congruity with the \u00c3\u00a6on-dead region\naround us. A voice from other epochs belongs in a graveyard of other\nepochs.\n\nAs it was, however, the noise shattered all our profoundly seated\nadjustments\u00e2\u0080\u0094all out tacit acceptance of the inner antarctic as a waste\nutterly and irrevocably void of every vestige of normal life.\n\nWhat we heard was not the fabulous note of any buried blasphemy of\nelder earth from whose supernal toughness an age-denied polar sun had\nevoked a monstrous response. Instead, it was a thing so mockingly\nnormal and so unerringly familiarized by our sea days off Victoria Land\nand our camp days at McMurdo Sound that we shuddered to think of it\nhere, where such things ought not to be. To be brief\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was simply the\nraucous squawking of a penguin.\n\nThe muffled sound floated from subglacial recesses nearly opposite to\nthe corridor whence we had come\u00e2\u0080\u0094regions manifestly in the direction\nof that other tunnel to the vast abyss. The presence of a living water\nbird in such a direction\u00e2\u0080\u0094in a world whose surface was one of age-long\nand uniform lifelessness\u00e2\u0080\u0094could lead to only one conclusion; hence our\nfirst thought was to verify the objective reality of the sound. It was,\nindeed, repeated, and seemed at times to come from more than one throat.\n\nSeeking its source, we entered an archway from which much d\u00c3\u00a9bris had\nbeen cleared; resuming our trail blazing\u00e2\u0080\u0094with an added paper supply\ntaken with curious repugnance from one of the tarpaulin bundles on the\nsledges\u00e2\u0080\u0094when we left daylight behind.\n\nAs the glaciated floor gave place to a litter of detritus, we plainly\ndiscerned some curious, dragging tracks; and once Danforth found\na distinct print of a sort whose description would be only too\nsuperfluous. The course indicated by the penguin cries was precisely\nwhat our map and compass prescribed as an approach to the more\nnortherly tunnel mouth, and we were glad to find that a bridgeless\nthoroughfare on the ground and basement levels seemed open.\n\nThe tunnel, according to the chart, ought to start from the basement of\na large pyramidal structure which we seemed vaguely to recall from our\na\u00c3\u00abrial survey as remarkably well-preserved. Along our path the single\ntorch showed a customary profusion of carvings, but we did not pause to\nexamine any of these.\n\nSuddenly a bulky white shape loomed up ahead of us, and we flashed on\nthe second torch. It is odd how wholly this new quest had turned our\nminds from earlier fears of what might lurk near. Those other ones,\nhaving left their supplies in the great circular place, must have\nplanned to return after their scouting trip toward or into the abyss;\nyet we had now discarded all caution concerning them as completely as\nif they had never existed.\n\nThis white, waddling thing was fully six feet high, yet we seemed to\nrealize at once that it was not one of those others. They were larger\nand dark, and, according to the sculptures, their motion over land\nsurfaces was a swift, assured matter despite the queerness of their\nsea-born tentacle equipment. But to say that the white thing did not\nprofoundly frighten us would be vain. We were indeed clutched for an\ninstant by a primitive dread almost sharper than the worst of our\nreasoned fears regarding those others.\n\nThen came a flash of anticlimax as the white shape sidled into a\nlateral archway to our left, to join two others of its kind which\nhad summoned it in raucous tones. For it was only a penguin\u00e2\u0080\u0094albeit\nof a huge, unknown species larger than the greatest of the known\nking penguins, and monstrous in its combined albinism and virtual\neyelessness.\n\nWhen we had followed the thing into the archway and turned both our\ntorches on the indifferent and unheeding group of three, we saw that\nthey were all eyeless albinos of the same unknown and gigantic species.\n\nTheir size reminded us of some of the archaic penguins depicted in the\nOld Ones' sculptures, and it did not take us long to conclude that\nthey were descended from the same stock\u00e2\u0080\u0094undoubtedly surviving through\na retreat to some warmer inner region whose perpetual blackness had\ndestroyed their pigmentation and atrophied their eyes to mere useless\nslits.\n\nThat their present habitat was the vast abyss we sought, was not for a\nmoment to be doubted; and this evidence of the gulf's continued warmth\nand habitability filled us with the most curious and subtly perturbing\nfancies.\n\nWe wondered, too, what had caused these three birds to venture out\nof their usual domain. The state and silence of the great dead city\nmade it clear that it had at no time been a habitual seasonal rookery,\nwhilst the manifest indifference of the trio to our presence made it\nseem odd that any passing party of those others should have startled\nthem.\n\nWas it possible that those others had taken some aggressive notion or\ntried to increase their meat supply? We doubted whether that pungent\nodor which the dogs had hated could cause an equal antipathy in these\npenguins; since their ancestors had obviously lived on excellent terms\nwith the Old Ones\u00e2\u0080\u0094an amicable relationship which must have survived in\nthe abyss below as long as any of the Old Ones remained.\n\nRegretting\u00e2\u0080\u0094in a flare-up of the old spirit of pure science\u00e2\u0080\u0094that we\ncould not photograph these anomalous creatures, we shortly left them\nto their squawking and pushed on toward the abyss whose openness was\nnow so positively proved to us, and whose exact direction occasional\npenguin tracks made clear.\n\nNot long afterward a steep descent in a long, low, doorless, and\npeculiarly sculptureless corridor led us to believe that we were\napproaching the tunnel mouth at last. We had passed two more penguins.\n\nThen the corridor ended in a prodigious open space which made us\ngasp involuntarily\u00e2\u0080\u0094a perfect inverted hemisphere, obviously deep\nunderground, fully a hundred feet in diameter and fifty feet high, with\nlow archways opening around all parts of the circumference but one, and\nthat one yawning cavernously with a black, arched aperture which broke\nthe symmetry of the vault to a height of nearly fifteen feet. It was\nthe entrance to the great abyss.\n\nIn this vast hemisphere, whose concave roof was impressively though\ndecadently carved to a likeness of the primordial celestial dome, a few\nalbino penguins waddled\u00e2\u0080\u0094aliens there, but indifferent and unseeing.\nThe black tunnel yawned indefinitely off at a steep, descending grade,\nits aperture adorned with grotesquely chiseled jambs and lintel.\n\nFrom that cryptical mouth we fancied a current of slightly warmer air\nand perhaps even a suspicion of vapor proceeded; and we wondered what\nliving entities other than penguins the limitless void below, and the\ncontiguous honeycombings of the land and the titan mountains, might\nconceal.\n\nWe wondered, too, whether the trace of mountaintop smoke at first\nsuspected by poor Lake, as well as the odd haze we had ourselves\nperceived around the rampart-crowned peak, might not be caused by\nthe tortuous-channeled rising of some such vapor from the unfathomed\nregions of earth's core.\n\nEntering the tunnel, we saw that its outline was\u00e2\u0080\u0094at least at the\nstart\u00e2\u0080\u0094about fifteen feet each way\u00e2\u0080\u0094sides, floor, and arched roof\ncomposed of the usual megalithic masonry. The sides were sparsely\ndecorated with cartouches of conventional designs in a later, decadent\nstyle; and all the construction and carving were marvellously\nwell-preserved.\n\nThe floor was quite clear, except for a slight detritus bearing\noutgoing penguin tracks and the inward tracks of those others. The\nfarther one advanced, the warmer it became; so that we were soon\nunbuttoning our heavy garments. We wondered whether there were any\nactually igneous manifestations below, and whether the waters of that\nsunless sea were hot.\n\nAfter a short distance the masonry gave place to solid rock, though\nthe tunnel kept the same proportions and presented the same aspect of\ncarved regularity. Occasionally its varying grade became so steep that\ngrooves were cut in the floor.\n\nSeveral times we noted the mouths of small lateral galleries not\nrecorded in our diagrams; none of them such as to complicate the\nproblem of our return, and all of them welcome as possible refuges in\ncase we met unwelcome entities on their way back from the abyss.\n\nThe nameless scent of such things was very distinct. Doubtless it\nwas suicidally foolish to venture into that tunnel under the known\nconditions, but the lure of the unplumbed is stronger in certain\npersons than most suspect\u00e2\u0080\u0094indeed, it was just such a lure which had\nbrought us to this unearthly polar waste in the first place.\n\nWe saw several penguins as we passed along, and speculated on the\ndistance we would have to traverse. The carvings had led us to expect\na steep downhill walk of about a mile to the abyss, but our previous\nwanderings had shown us that matters of scale were not wholly to be\ndepended on.\n\nAfter about a quarter of a mile that nameless scent became greatly\naccentuated, and we kept very careful track of the various lateral\nopenings we passed. There was no visible vapor as at the mouth, but\nthis was doubtless due to the lack of contrasting cooler air. The\ntemperature was rapidly ascending, and we were not surprised to come\nupon a careless heap of material shudderingly familiar to us. It was\ncomposed of furs and tent cloths taken from Lake's camp, and we did\nnot pause to study the bizarre forms into which the fabrics had been\nslashed.\n\nSlightly beyond this point we noticed a decided increase in the size\nand number of the side galleries, and concluded that the densely\nhoneycombed region beneath the higher foothills must now have been\nreached.\n\nThe nameless scent was now curiously mixed with another and scarcely\nless offensive odor\u00e2\u0080\u0094of what nature we could not guess, though we\nthought of decaying organisms and perhaps unknown subterrane fungi.\n\nThen came a startling expansion of the tunnel for which the\ncarvings had not prepared us\u00e2\u0080\u0094a broadening and rising into a lofty,\nnatural-looking elliptical cavern with a level floor, some seventy-five\nfeet long and fifty broad, and with many immense side passages leading\naway into cryptical darkness.\n\nThough this cavern was natural in appearance, an inspection with both\ntorches suggested that it had been formed by the artificial destruction\nof several walls between adjacent honeycombings. The walls were\nrough, and the high, vaulted roof was thick with stalactites; but the\nsolid rock floor had been smoothed off, and was free from all d\u00c3\u00a9bris,\ndetritus, or even dust to a positively abnormal extent.\n\nExcept for the avenue through which we had come, this was true of\nthe floors of all the great galleries opening off from it; and the\nsingularity of the condition was such as to set us vainly puzzling.\n\nThe curious new fetor which had supplemented the nameless scent was\nexcessively pungent here; so much so that it destroyed all trace of the\nother. Something about this whole place, with its polished and almost\nglistening floor, struck us as more vaguely baffling and horrible than\nany of the monstrous things we have previously encountered.\n\nThe regularity of the passage immediately ahead, prevented all\nconfusion as to the right course amidst this plethora of equally great\ncave mouths. Nevertheless we resolved to resume our paper trail blazing\nif any further complexity should develop; for dust tracks, of course,\ncould no longer be expected.\n\nUpon resuming our direct progress we cast a beam of torchlight over the\ntunnel walls\u00e2\u0080\u0094and stopped short in amazement at the supremely radical\nchange which had come over the carvings in this part of the passage.\nWe realized, of course, the great decadence of the Old Ones' sculpture\nat the time of the tunneling, and had indeed noticed the inferior\nworkmanship of the arabesques in the stretches behind us.\n\nBut now, in this deeper section beyond the cavern, there was a sudden\ndifference wholly transcending explanation\u00e2\u0080\u0094a difference in basic\nnature as well as in mere quality, and involving so profound and\ncalamitous a degradation of skill that nothing in the hitherto observed\nrate of decline could have led one to expect it.\n\nThis new and degenerate work was coarse, bold, and wholly lacking in\ndelicacy of detail. It was countersunk with exaggerated depth in bands\nfollowing the same general line as the sparse cartouches of the earlier\nsections, but the height of the reliefs did not reach the level of the\ngeneral surface.\n\nDanforth had the idea that it was a second carving\u00e2\u0080\u0094a sort of\npalimpsest formed after the obliteration of a previous design. In\nnature it was wholly decorative and conventional, and consisted of\ncrude spirals and angles roughly following the quintile mathematical\ntradition of the Old Ones, yet seeming more like a parody than a\nperpetuation of that tradition.\n\nSince we could not afford to spend any considerable time in study, we\nresumed our advance after a cursory look.\n\nWe saw and heard fewer penguins, but thought we caught a vague\nsuspicion of an infinitely distant chorus of them somewhere deep within\nthe earth. The new and inexplicable odor was abominably strong, and we\ncould detect scarcely a sign of that other nameless scent.\n\nPuffs of visible vapor ahead bespoke increasing contrasts in\ntemperature, and the relative nearness of the sunless sea cliffs of the\ngreat abyss. Then, quite unexpectedly, we saw certain obstructions on\nthe polished floor ahead\u00e2\u0080\u0094obstructions which were quite definitely not\npenguins\u00e2\u0080\u0094and turned on our second torch after making sure that the\nobjects were quite stationary.\n\nXI.\n\nStill another time have I come to a place where it is very difficult\nto proceed. I ought to be hardened by this stage; but there are some\nexperiences and intimations which scar too deeply to permit of healing,\nand leave only such added sensitiveness that memory re-inspired all the\noriginal horror.\n\nWe saw, as I have said, certain obstructions on the polished\nfloor ahead; and I may add that our nostrils were assailed almost\nsimultaneously by a very curious intensification of the strange,\nprevailing fetor, now quite plainly mixed with the nameless stench of\nthose others which had gone before us.\n\nThe light of the second torch left no doubt of what the obstructions\nwere, and we dared approach them only because we could see, even from\na distance, that they were quite as past all harming power as had been\nthe six similar specimens unearthed from the monstrous star-mounded\ngraves at poor Lake's camp.\n\nThey were, indeed, as lacking in completeness as most of those we\nhad unearthed\u00e2\u0080\u0094though it grew plain from the thick, dark-green pool\ngathering around them that their incompleteness was of infinitely\ngreater recency. There seemed to be only four of them, whereas Lake's\nbulletins would have suggested no less than eight as forming the\ngroup which had preceded us. To find them in this state was wholly\nunexpected, and we wondered what sort of monstrous struggle had\noccurred down here in the dark.\n\nPenguins, attacked in a body, retaliate savagely with their beaks; and\nour ears now made certain the existence of a rookery far beyond. Had\nthose others disturbed such a place and aroused murderous pursuit? The\nobstructions did not suggest it, for penguin beaks against the tough\ntissues Lake had dissected could hardly account for the terrible damage\nour approaching glance was beginning to make out. Besides, the huge\nblind birds we had seen appeared to be singularly peaceful.\n\nHad there, then, been a struggle among those others, and were the\nabsent four responsible? If so, where were they? Were they close at\nhand and likely to form an immediate menace to us? We glanced anxiously\nat some of the smooth-floored lateral passages as we continued our slow\nand frankly reluctant approach.\n\nWhatever the conflict was, it had clearly been that which had\nfrightened the penguins into their unaccustomed wandering. It must,\nthen, have arisen near that faintly heard rookery in the incalculable\ngulf beyond, since there were no signs that any birds had normally\ndwelt here.\n\nPerhaps, we reflected, there had been a hideous running fight, with\nthe weaker party seeking to get back to the cached sledges when their\npursuers finished them. One could picture the demonic fray between\nnamelessly monstrous entities as it surged out of the black abyss with\ngreat clouds of frantic penguins squawking and scurrying ahead.\n\nI say that we approached those sprawling and incomplete obstructions\nslowly and reluctantly. Would to Heaven we had never approached them at\nall, but had run back at top speed out of that blasphemous tunnel with\nthe greasily smooth floors and the degenerate murals aping and mocking\nthe things they had superseded\u00e2\u0080\u0094run back, before we had seen what we\ndid see, and before our minds were burned with something which will\nnever let us breathe easily again!\n\nBoth of our torches were turned on the prostrate objects, so that we\nsoon realized the dominant factor in their incompleteness. Mauled,\ncompressed, twisted, and ruptured as they were, their chief common\ninjury was total decapitation.\n\nFrom each one the tentacled starfish head had been removed; and as\nwe drew near we saw that the manner of removal looked more like some\nhellish tearing or suction than like any ordinary form of cleavage.\n\nTheir noisome dark-green ichor formed a large, spreading pool; but its\nstench was half overshadowed by that newer and stranger stench, here\nmore pungent than at any other point along our route.\n\nOnly when we had come very close to the sprawling obstructions could we\ntrace that second, unexplainable fetor to any immediate source\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the\ninstant we did so Danforth, remembering certain very vivid sculptures\nof the Old Ones' history in the Permian Age one hundred and fifty\nmillion years ago, gave vent to a nerve-tortured cry which echoed\nhysterically through that vaulted and archaic passage with the evil,\npalimpsest carvings.\n\nI came only just short of echoing his cry myself; for I had seen those\nprimal sculptures, too, and had shudderingly admired the way the\nnameless artist had suggested that hideous slime coating found on\ncertain incomplete and prostrate Old Ones\u00e2\u0080\u0094those whom the frightful\nShoggoths had characteristically slain and sucked to a ghastly\nheadlessness in the great war of resubjugation.\n\nThey were infamous, nightmare sculptures even when telling of age-old,\nbygone things; for Shoggoths and their work ought not to be seen by\nhuman beings or portrayed by any beings.\n\nThe mad author of the Necronomicon had nervously tried to swear that\nnone had been bred on this planet, and that only drugged dreamers\nhad ever conceived them. Formless protoplasm able to mock and\nreflect all forms and organs and processes\u00e2\u0080\u0094viscous agglutinations\nof bubbling cells\u00e2\u0080\u0094rubbery fifteen-foot spheroids infinitely plastic\nand ductile\u00e2\u0080\u0094slaves of suggestion, builders of cities\u00e2\u0080\u0094more and more\nsullen, more and more intelligent, more and more amphibious, more and\nmore imitative! Great Heaven! What madness made even those blasphemous\nOld Ones willing to use and to carve such things?\n\nAnd now, when Danforth and I saw the freshly glistening and\nreflectively iridescent black slime which clung thickly to those\nheadless bodies and stank obscenely with that new, unknown odor whose\ncause only a diseased fancy could envisage\u00e2\u0080\u0094clung to those bodies\nand sparkled less voluminously on a smooth part of the accursedly\nresculptured wall in a series of grouped dots\u00e2\u0080\u0094we understood the\nquality of cosmic fear to its uttermost depths.\n\nIt was not fear of those four missing others\u00e2\u0080\u0094for all too well did we\nsuspect they would do no harm again. Poor devils! After all, they were\nnot evil things of their kind. They were the men of another age and\nanother order of being. Nature had played a hellish jest on them\u00e2\u0080\u0094as\nit will on any others that human madness, callousness, or cruelty may\nhereafter drag up in that hideously dead or sleeping polar waste\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\nthis was their tragic homecoming.\n\nThey had not been even savages\u00e2\u0080\u0094for what indeed had they done? That\nawful awakening in the cold of an unknown epoch\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps an attack by\nthe furry, frantically barking quadrupeds, and a dazed defense against\nthem and the equally frantic white simians with the queer wrappings and\nparaphernalia! Poor Lake. Poor Gedney. And poor Old Ones! Scientists\nto the last\u00e2\u0080\u0094what had they done that we would not have done in their\nplace? Lord, what intelligence and persistence! What a facing of the\nincredible, just as those carven kinsmen and forbears had faced things\nonly a little less incredible! Radiates, vegetables, monstrosities,\nstar spawn\u00e2\u0080\u0094whatever they had been, they were men!\n\nThey had crossed the icy peaks on whose templed slopes they had once\nworshiped and roamed among the tree ferns. They had found their dead\ncity brooding under its curse, and had read its carven latter days as\nwe had done. They had tried to reach their living fellows in fabled\ndepths of blackness they had never seen\u00e2\u0080\u0094and what had they found?\n\nAll this flashed in unison through the thoughts of Danforth and me as\nwe looked from those headless, slime-coated shapes to the loathsome\npalimpsest sculptures and the diabolical dot groups of fresh slime on\nthe wall beside them\u00e2\u0080\u0094looked and understood what must have triumphed\nand survived down there in the Cyclopean water city of that nighted,\npenguin-fringed abyss, whence even now a sinister curling mist had\nbegun to belch pallidly as if in answer to Danforth's hysterical scream.\n\nThe shock of recognizing that monstrous slime and headlessness had\nfrozen us into mute, motionless statues, and it is only through later\nconversations that we have learned of the complete identity of our\nthoughts at that moment.\n\nIt seemed \u00c3\u00a6ons that we stood there, but actually it could not have been\nmore than ten or fifteen seconds. That hateful, pallid mist curled\nforward as if veritably driven by some remoter advancing bulk\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then\ncame a sound which upset much of what we had just decided, and in so\ndoing broke the spell and enabled us to run like mad past squawking,\nconfused penguins over our former trail back to the city, along\nice-sunken megalithic corridors to the great open circle, and up that\narchaic spiral ramp in a frenzied, automatic plunge for the sane outer\nair and light of day.\n\nAnd then came a sound\u00e2\u0080\u0094a horrible sound\u00e2\u0080\u0094which enabled us to run like mad for the sane outer air \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nThe new sound, as I have intimated, upset much that we had decided;\nbecause it was what poor Lake's dissection had led us to attribute\nto those we had just judged dead. It was, Danforth later told me,\nprecisely what he had caught in infinitely muffled form when at that\nspot beyond the alley corner above the glacial level; and it certainly\nhad a shocking resemblance to the wind pipings we had both heard around\nthe lofty mountain caves.\n\nAt the risk of seeming puerile I will add another thing, too, if\nonly because of the surprising way Danforth's impression chimed with\nmine. Of course, common reading is what prepared us both to make the\ninterpretation, though Danforth has hinted at queer notions about\nunsuspected and forbidden sources to which Poe may have had access when\nwriting his \"Arthur Gordon Pym\" a century ago.\n\nIt will be remembered that in that fantastic tale there is a word of\nunknown but terrible and prodigious significance connected with the\nantarctic and screamed eternally by the gigantic, spectrally snowy\nbirds of that malign region's core. \" Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li! \" That, I\nmay admit, is exactly what we thought we heard conveyed by that sudden\nsound behind the advancing white mist\u00e2\u0080\u0094that insidious, musical piping\nover a singularly wide range.\n\nWe were in full flight before three notes or syllables had been\nuttered, though we knew that the swiftness of the Old Ones would enable\nany scream-roused and pursuing survivor of the slaughter to overtake us\nin a moment if it really wished to do so.\n\nWe had a vague hope, however, that nonaggressive conduct and a display\nof kindred reason might cause such a being to spare us in case of\ncapture, if only from scientific curiosity.\n\nAfter all, if such a one had nothing to fear for itself it would have\nno motive in harming us. Concealment being futile at this juncture, we\nused our torch for a running glance behind, and perceived that the mist\nwas thinning. Would we see at last, a complete and living specimen of\nthose others? Again came that insidious musical piping\u00e2\u0080\u0094\" Tekeli-li!\nTekeli-li! \"\n\nThen, noting that we were actually gaining on our pursuer, it occurred\nto us that the entity might be wounded. We could take no chances,\nhowever, since it was very obviously approaching in answer to\nDanforth's scream, rather than in flight from any other entity. The\ntiming was too close to admit of doubt.\n\nOf the whereabouts of that less conceivable and less mentionable\nnightmare\u00e2\u0080\u0094that fetid, unglimpsed mountain of slime-spewing protoplasm\nwhose race had conquered the abyss and sent land pioneers to recarve\nand squirm through the burrows of the hills\u00e2\u0080\u0094we could form no guess;\nand it cost us a genuine pang to leave this probably crippled Old\nOne\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps a lone survivor\u00e2\u0080\u0094to the peril of recapture and a nameless\nfate.\n\nThank Heaven we did not slacken our run. The curling mist had thickened\nagain, and was driving ahead with increased speed; whilst the straying\npenguins in our rear were squawking and screaming and displaying\nsigns of a panic really surprising in view of their relatively minor\nconfusion when we had passed them.\n\nOnce more came that sinister, wide-ranged piping\u00e2\u0080\u0094\" Tekeli-li!\nTekeli-li! \" We had been wrong. The thing was not wounded, but had\nmerely paused on encountering the bodies of its fallen kindred and the\nhellish slime inscription above them. We could never know what that\ndemon message was\u00e2\u0080\u0094but those burials at Lake's camp had shown how much\nimportance the beings attached to their dead.\n\nOur recklessly used torch now revealed ahead of us the large open\ncavern where various ways converged, and we were glad to be leaving\nthose morbid palimpsest sculptures\u00e2\u0080\u0094almost felt even when scarcely\nseen\u00e2\u0080\u0094behind.\n\nAnother thought which the advent of the cave inspired was the\npossibility of losing our pursuer at this bewildering focus of large\ngalleries. There were several of the blind albino penguins in the open\nspace, and it seemed clear that their fear of the oncoming entity was\nextreme to the point of unaccountability.\n\nIf at that point we dimmed our torch to the very lowest limit of\ntraveling need, keeping it strictly in front of us, the frightened\nsquawking motions of the huge birds in the mist might muffle our\nfootfalls, screen our true course, and somehow set up a false lead.\n\nAmidst the churning, spiraling fog, the littered and unglistening floor\nof the main tunnel beyond this point, as differing from the other\nmorbidly polished burrows, could hardly form a highly distinguishing\nfeature; even, so far as we could conjecture, for those indicated\nspecial senses which made the Old Ones partly, though imperfectly,\nindependent of light in emergencies.\n\nIn fact, we were somewhat apprehensive lest we go astray ourselves\nin our haste. For we had, of course, decided to keep straight on\ntoward the dead city; since the consequences of loss in those unknown\nfoothill honeycombings would be unthinkable.\n\nThe fact that we survived and emerged is sufficient proof that the\nthing did take a wrong gallery whilst we providentially hit on\nthe right one. The penguins alone could not have saved us, but in\nconjunction with the mist they seem to have done so. Only a benign fate\nkept the curling vapors thick enough at the right moment, for they were\nconstantly shifting and threatening to vanish.\n\nIndeed, they did lift for a second just before we emerged from the\nnauseously resculptured tunnel into the cave; so that we actually\ncaught one first and only half glimpse of the oncoming entity as we\ncast a final, desperately fearful glance backward before dimming the\ntorch and mixing with the penguins in the hope of dodging pursuit. If\nthe fate which screened us was benign, that which gave us the half\nglimpse was infinitely the opposite; for to that flash of semivision\ncan be traced a full half of the horror which has ever since haunted us.\n\nOur exact motive in looking back again was perhaps no more than the\nimmemorial instinct of the pursued to gauge the nature and course\nof its pursuer; or perhaps it was an automatic attempt to answer a\nsubconscious question raised by one of our senses.\n\nIn the midst of our flight, with all our faculties centered on the\nproblem of escape, we were in no condition to observe and analyze\ndetails; yet even so our latent brain cells must have wondered at the\nmessage brought them by our nostrils. Afterward, we realized what it\nwas\u00e2\u0080\u0094that our retreat from the fetid slime coating on those headless\nobstructions, and the coincident approach of the pursuing entity, had\nnot brought us the exchange of stenches which logic called for.\n\nIn the neighborhood of the prostrate things that new and lately\nunexplainable fetor had been wholly dominant; but by this time it ought\nto have largely given place to the nameless stench associated with\nthose others. This it had not done\u00e2\u0080\u0094for instead, the newer and less\nbearable smell was now virtually undiluted, and growing more and more\npoisonously insistent each second.\n\nSo we glanced back\u00e2\u0080\u0094simultaneously, it would appear; though no doubt\nthe incipient motion of one prompted the imitation of the other. As\nwe did so we flashed both torches full strength at the momentarily\nthinned mist; either from sheer primitive anxiety to see all we could,\nor in a less primitive but equally unconscious effort to dazzle the\nentity before we dimmed our light and dodged among the penguins of the\nlabyrinth center ahead.\n\nUnhappy act! Not Orpheus himself, or Lot's wife, paid much more dearly\nfor a backward glance. And again came that shocking, wide-ranged\npiping\u00e2\u0080\u0094\" Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li! \"\n\nDanforth was totally unstrung, and the first thing I remember of the\nrest of the journey was hearing him light-headedly chant a hysterical\nformula in which I alone of mankind could have found anything but\ninsane irrelevance. It reverberated in falsetto echoes among the\nsquawks of the penguins; reverberated through the vaulting ahead,\nand\u00e2\u0080\u0094thank Heaven\u00e2\u0080\u0094through the now empty vaultings behind. He could not\nhave begun it at once\u00e2\u0080\u0094else we would not have been alive and blindly\nracing. I shudder to think of what a shade of difference in his nervous\nreactions might have brought.\n\n\"South Station Under\u00e2\u0080\u0094Washington Under\u00e2\u0080\u0094Park Street\nUnder\u00e2\u0080\u0094Kendall\u00e2\u0080\u0094Central\u00e2\u0080\u0094Harvard\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\" The poor fellow was chanting the\nfamiliar stations of the Boston-Cambridge tunnel that burrowed through\nour peaceful native soil thousands of miles away in New England, yet to\nme the ritual had neither irrelevance nor home feeling. It had only\nhorror, because I knew unerringly the monstrous, nefandous analogy that\nhad suggested it.\n\nWe had expected, upon looking back, to see a terrible and incredible\nmoving entity if the mists were thin enough; but of that entity we had\nformed a clear idea. What we did see\u00e2\u0080\u0094for the mists were indeed all too\nmalignly thinned\u00e2\u0080\u0094was something altogether different, and immeasurably\nmore hideous and detestable. It was the utter, objective embodiment of\nthe fantastic novelist's 'thing that should not be'; and its nearest\ncomprehensible analogue is a vast, onrushing subway train as one sees\nit from a station platform\u00e2\u0080\u0094the great black front looming colossally\nout of infinite subterraneous distance, constellated with strangely\ncolored lights and filling the prodigious burrow.\n\nBut we were not on a station platform. We were on the track ahead as\nthe nightmare, plastic column of fetid black iridescence oozed tightly\nonward through its fifteen-foot sinus, gathering unholy speed and\ndriving before it a spiral, rethickening cloud of the pallid abyss\nvapor.\n\nIt was a terrible, indescribable thing, vaster than any subway train\u00e2\u0080\u0094a\nshapeless congeries of protoplasmic bubbles, faintly self-luminous, and\nwith myriads of temporary eyes forming and unforming as pustules of\ngreenish light all over the tunnel-filling front that bore down upon\nus, crushing the frantic penguins and slithering over the glistening\nfloor that it and its kind had swept so evilly free of all litter.\n\nStill came that eldritch, mocking cry\u00e2\u0080\u0094\" Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li! \" And at\nlast we remembered that the demonic Shoggoths\u00e2\u0080\u0094given life, though, and\nplastic organ patterns solely by the Old Ones, and having no language\nsave that which the dot groups expressed\u00e2\u0080\u0094had likewise no voice save\nthe imitated accents of their bygone masters.\n\nXII.\n\nDanforth and I have recollections of emerging into the great sculptured\nhemisphere and of threading our back trail through the Cyclopean rooms\nand corridors of the dead city; yet these are purely dream fragments\ninvolving no memory of volition, details, or physical exertion.\n\nThere was something vaguely appropriate about our departure from those\nburied epochs; for as we wound our panting way up the sixty-foot\ncylinder of primal masonry we glimpsed beside us a continuous\nprocession of heroic sculptures in the dead race's early and undecayed\ntechnique\u00e2\u0080\u0094a farewell from the Old Ones, written fifty million years\nago.\n\nFinally, scrambling out at the top, we found ourselves on a great mound\nof tumbled blocks, with the curved walls of higher stonework rising\nwestward, and the brooding peaks of the great mountains showing beyond\nthe more crumbled structures toward the east.\n\nThe sky above was a churning and opalescent mass of tenuous ice vapors,\nand the cold clutched at our vitals.\n\nIn less than a quarter of an hour we had found the steep grade to the\nfoothills\u00e2\u0080\u0094the probable ancient terrace\u00e2\u0080\u0094by which we had descended, and\ncould see the dark bulk of our great plane amidst the sparse ruins on\nthe rising slope ahead.\n\nHalfway uphill toward our goal we paused for a momentary breathing\nspell, and turned to look again at the fantastic tangle of incredible\nstone shapes below us\u00e2\u0080\u0094once more outlined mystically against an unknown\nwest. As we did so we saw that the sky beyond had lost its morning\nhaziness; the restless ice vapors having moved up to the zenith, where\ntheir mocking outlines seemed on the point of settling into some\nbizarre pattern which they feared to make quite definite or conclusive.\n\nThere now lay revealed on the ultimate white horizon behind\nthe grotesque city a dim, elfin line of pinnacled violet whose\nneedle-pointed heights loomed dreamlike against the beckoning rose\ncolor of the western sky. Up toward this shimmering rim sloped the\nancient table-land, the depressed course of the bygone river traversing\nit as an irregular ribbon of shadow.\n\nFor a second we gasped in admiration of the scene's unearthly cosmic\nbeauty, and then vague horror began to creep into our souls. For this\nfar violet line could be nothing else than the terrible mountains of\nthe forbidden land\u00e2\u0080\u0094highest of earth's peaks and focus of earth's evil;\nharborers of nameless horrors and Arch\u00c3\u00a6an secrets; shunned and prayed\nto by those who feared to carve their meaning; untrodden by any living\nthing of earth, but visited by the sinister lightnings and sending\nstrange beams across the plains in the polar night.\n\nIf the sculptured maps and pictures in that prehuman city had told\ntruly, these cryptic violet mountains could not be much less than three\nhundred miles away; yet none the less sharply did their dim elfin\nessence jut above that remote and snowy rim, like the serrated edge of\na monstrous alien planet about to rise into unaccustomed heavens.\n\nLooking at them, I thought nervously of certain sculptured hints of\nwhat the great bygone river had washed down into the city from their\naccursed sloping\u00e2\u0080\u0094and wondered how much sense and how much folly had\nlain in the fears of those Old Ones who carved them so reticently.\n\nI recalled how their northerly end must come near the coast at Queen\nMary Land, where even at that moment Sir Douglas Mawson's expedition\nwas doubtless working less than a thousand miles away; and hoped that\nno evil fate would give Sir Douglas and his men a glimpse of what\nmight lie beyond the protecting coastal range. Such thoughts formed a\nmeasure of my overwrought condition at the time\u00e2\u0080\u0094and Danforth seemed to\nbe even worse.\n\nYet before we had passed the great star-shaped ruin and reached our\nplane our fears had become transferred to the lesser, but vast enough,\nrange whose re-crossing lay ahead of us.\n\nFrom these foothills the black, ruin-crusted slopes reared up starkly\nand hideously against the east, again reminding us of those strange\nAsian paintings of Nicholas Roerich; and when we thought of the\ndamnable honeycombings inside them, and of the frightful amorphous\nentities that might have pushed their fetidly squirming sway even to\nthe topmost hollow pinnacles, we could not face without panic the\nprospect of again sailing by those suggestive skyward cave mouths where\nthe wind made sounds like an evil musical piping over a wide range.\n\nTo make matters worse, we saw distinct traces of local mist around\nseveral of the summits\u00e2\u0080\u0094as poor Lake must have done when he made that\nearly mistake about volcanism\u00e2\u0080\u0094and thought shiveringly of that kindred\nmist from which we had just escaped\u00e2\u0080\u0094of that, and of the blasphemous,\nhorror-fostering abyss whence all such vapors came.\n\nAll was well with the plane, and we clumsily hauled on our heavy flying\nfurs. Danforth got the engine started without trouble, and we made a\nvery smooth take-off over the nightmare city.\n\nAt a very high level there must have been great disturbance, since the\nice-dust clouds of the zenith were doing all sorts of fantastic things;\nbut at twenty-four thousand feet, the height we needed for the pass, we\nfound navigation quite practicable.\n\nAs we drew close to the jutting peaks the wind's strange piping again\nbecame manifest, and I could see Danforth's hands trembling at the\ncontrols. Rank amateur though I was, I thought at that moment that I\nmight be a better navigator than he in effecting the dangerous crossing\nbetween pinnacles; and when I made motions to change seats and take\nover his duties he did not protest.\n\nI tried to keep all my skill and self-possession about me, and stared\nat the sector of reddish farther sky betwixt the walls of the pass.\n\nBut Danforth, released from his piloting and keyed up to a dangerous\nnervous pitch, could not keep quiet. I felt him turning and wriggling\nabout as he looked back at the terrible receding city, ahead at the\ncave-riddled, cube-barnacled peaks, sidewise at the bleak sea of snowy,\nrampart-strown foothills, and upward at the seething, grotesquely\nclouded sky.\n\nIt was then, just as I was trying to steer safely through the pass,\nthat his mad shrieking brought us so close to disaster, by shattering\nmy tight hold on myself and causing me to fumble helplessly with the\ncontrols for a moment. A second afterward my resolution triumphed and\nwe made the crossing safely\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094Yet I am afraid that Danforth will never\nbe the same again.\n\nI have said that Danforth refused to tell me what final horror made him\nscream out so insanely\u00e2\u0080\u0094a horror which, I feel sadly sure, is mainly\nresponsible for his present breakdown. We had snatches of shouted\nconversation above the wind's piping and the engine's buzzing as we\nreached the safe side of the range and swooped slowly down toward the\ncamp, but that had mostly to do with the pledges of secrecy we had made\nas we prepared to leave the nightmare city.\n\nAll that Danforth has ever hinted is that the final horror was a\nmirage. It was not, he declares, anything connected with the cubes\nand caves of those echoing, vaporous, wormily honeycombed mountains\nof madness which we crossed; but a single fantastic, demonic glimpse,\namong the churning westward zenith clouds, of what lay back of those\nother violet westward mountains which the Old Ones had shunned and\nfeared.\n\nHe has on rare occasions whispered disjointed and irresponsible things\nabout \"the black pit,\" \"the carven rim,\" \"the proto-Shoggoths,\" \"the\nwindowless solids with five dimensions,\" \"the nameless cylinders,\" \"the\nelder pharos,\" \"Yog-Sothoth,\" \"the primal white jelly,\" \"the color out\nof space,\" \"the wings,\" \"the eyes in darkness,\" \"the moon-ladder,\" \"the\noriginal, the eternal, the undying,\" and other bizarre conceptions;\nbut when he is fully himself he repudiates all this and attributes it\nto his curious and macabre reading of earlier years. Danforth, indeed,\nis known to be among the few who have ever dared go completely through\nthat worm-riddled copy of the Necronomicon kept under lock and key in\nthe college library.\n\nThe higher sky, as we crossed the range, was surely vaporous and\ndisturbed enough; and although I did not see the zenith I can well\nimagine that its swirls of ice dust may have taken strange forms.\nImagination, knowing how vividly distant scenes can sometimes be\nreflected, refracted, and magnified by such layers of restless cloud,\nmight easily have supplied the rest\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, of course, Danforth did not\nhint any of these specific horrors till after his memory had had a\nchance to draw on his bygone reading. He could never have seen so much\nin one instantaneous glance.\n\nAt the time, his shrieks were confined to the repetition of a single,\nmad word of all too obvious source: \" Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li! \"\n\nTHE END",
