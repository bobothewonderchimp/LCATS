Lovecraft\n\n\"The nightmare horde slithered away,\nled by the abominable naked\nphosphorescent thing that now strode insolently,\nbearing in its arms the glassy-eyed corpse of\nthe corpulent old man.\n\n\"There are sacraments of evil as well as of\ngood about us, and we live and move to my\nbelief in an unknown world, a place where\nthere are caves and shadows and dwellers in\ntwilight.  It is possible that man may\nsometimes return on the track of evolution, and\nit is my belief that an awful lore is not yet\ndead.\"\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094Arthur Machen\n\nI\n\nNot many weeks ago, on a street corner\nin the village of Pascoag, Rhode\nIsland, a tall heavily built, and\nwholesome looking pedestrian furnished much\nspeculation by a singular lapse of behavior.\nHe had, it appears, been descending the hill\nby the road from Chepachet; and encountering\nthe compact section, had turned to\nhis left into the main thoroughfare where\nseveral modest business blocks convey a\ntouch of the urban.  At this point, without\nvisible provocation, he committed his astonishing\nlapse; staring queerly for a second at\nthe tallest of the buildings, before him,\nand then, with a series of terrified, hysterical\nshrieks, breaking into a frantic run which\nended in a stumble and fall at the next\ncrossing.  Picked up and dusted off by ready\nhands, he was found to be conscious,\norganically unhurt, and evidently cured of his\nsudden nervous attack.  He muttered some\nshamefaced explanations involving a strain\nhe had undergone, and with downcast glance\nturned back, up the Chepachet road,\ntrudging out of sight, without once looking\nbehind him.  It was a strange incident to\nbefall so large, robust, normal-featured,\nand capable-looking a man, and the strangeness\nwas not lessened by the remarks of a\nbystander who had recognized him as the\nboarder of a well-known dairyman on the\noutskirts of Chepachet.\n\nHe was, it developed, a New York\npolice-detective named Thomas F. Malone, now\non a long leave of absence under medical\ntreatment after some disproportionately\narduous work on a gruesome local case which\naccident had made dramatic.  There had been\na collapse of several old brick buildings\nduring a raid in which he had shared, and\nsomething about the wholesale loss of life,\nboth of prisoners and of his companions,\nhad peculiarly appalled him.  As a result,\nhe had acquired an acute and anomalous\nhorror of any buildings even remotely\nsuggesting the ones which had fallen in, so that\nin the end mental specialists forbade him\nthe sight of such things for an indefinite\nperiod.  A police surgeon with relatives in\nChepachet had put forward that quaint\nhamlet of wooden Colonial houses as an ideal\nspot for the psychological convalescence; and\nthither the sufferer had gone, promising\nnever to venture among the brick-lined\nstreets of larger villages till duly advised by\nthe Woonsocket specialist with whom he\nwas put in touch.  This walk to Pascoag for\nmagazines had been a mistake, and the\npatient had paid in fright, bruises, and\nhumiliation for his disobedience.\n\nSo much the gossips of Chepachet and\nPascoag knew; and so much, also, the most\nlearned specialists believed.  But Malone had\nat first told the specialists much more,\nceasing only when he saw that utter incredulity\nwas his portion.  Thereafter he held his\npeace, protesting not at all when it was\ngenerally agreed that the collapse of certain\nsqualid brick houses in the Red Hook\nsection of Brooklyn, and the consequent death\nof many brave officers, had unseated his\nnervous equilibrium.  He had worked too\nhard, all said, in trying to clean up those\nnests of disorder and violence; certain\nfeatures were shocking enough, in all\nconscience, and the unexpected tragedy was the\nlast straw.  This was a simple explanation\nwhich everyone could understand, and\nbecause Malone was not a simple person he\nperceived that he had better let it suffice.\nTo hint to unimaginative people of a horror\nbeyond all human conception\u00e2\u0080\u0094a horror of\nhouses and blocks and cities leprous and\ncancerous with evil dragged from elder\nworlds\u00e2\u0080\u0094would be merely to invite a padded\ncell instead of a restful rustication, and\nMalone was a man of sense despite his\nmysticism.  He had the Celt's far vision of\nweird and hidden things, but the logician's\nquick eye for the outwardly unconvincing;\nan amalgam which had led him far afield in\nthe forty-two years of his life, and set him\nin strange places for a Dublin University\nman born in a Georgian villa near Phoenix\nPark.\n\nAnd now, as he reviewed the things\nhe had seen and felt and apprehended,\nMalone was content to keep unshared the\nsecret of what could reduce a dauntless\nfighter to a quivering neurotic; what could\nmake old brick slums and seas of dark,\nsubtle faces a thing of nightmare and\neldritch portent.  It would not be the first\ntime his sensations had been forced to bide\nuninterpreted\u00e2\u0080\u0094for was not his very act of\nplunging into the polyglot abyss of New\nYork's underworld a freak beyond sensible\nexplanation?  What could he tell the prosaic\nof the antique witcheries and grotesque\nmarvels discernible to sensitive eyes amidst\nthe poison cauldron where all the varied\ndregs of unwholesome ages mix their venom\nand perpetuate their obscene terrors?  He\nhad seen the hellish green flame of secret\nwonder in this blatant, evasive welter of\noutward greed and inward blasphemy, and\nhad smiled gently when all the New Yorkers\nhe knew scoffed at his experiment in\npolice work.  They had been very witty and\ncynical, deriding his fantastic pursuit of\nunknowable mysteries and assuring him that\nin these days New York held nothing but\ncheapness and vulgarity.  One of them had\nwagered him a heavy sum that he could\nnot\u00e2\u0080\u0094despite many poignant things to his credit\nin the Dublin Review \u00e2\u0080\u0094even write a truly\ninteresting story of New York low life; and\nnow, looking back, he perceived that cosmic\nirony had justified the prophet's words while\nsecretly confuting their flippant meaning.\nThe horror, as glimpsed at last, could not\nmake a story\u00e2\u0080\u0094for like the book cited by\nPoe's German authority, \"er l\u00c3\u00a4sst sich nicht\nlesen\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094it does not permit itself to be read.\n\nII\n\nTo Malone the sense of latent\nmystery in existence was always present.\nIn youth he had felt the hidden beauty and\necstasy of things, and had been a poet; but\npoverty and sorrow and exile had turned his\ngaze in darker directions, and he had\nthrilled at the imputations of evil in the\nworld around.  Daily life had for him come\nto be a fantasmagoria of macabre shadow-studies;\nnow glittering and jeering with concealed\nrottenness as in Aubrey Beardsley's\nbest manner, now hinting terrors behind the\ncommonest shapes and objects as in the\nsubtler and less obvious work of Gustave\nDor\u00c3\u00a9.  He would often regard it as merciful\nthat most persons of high intelligence jeer\nat the inmost mysteries; for, he argued, if\nsuperior minds were ever placed in fullest\ncontact with the secrets preserved by ancient\nand lowly cults, the resultant abnormalities\nwould soon not only wreck the world,\nbut threaten the very integrity of the\nuniverse.  All this reflection was no doubt\nmorbid, but keen logic and a deep sense of\nhumor ably offset it.  Malone was satisfied to\nlet his notions remain as half-spied and\nforbidden visions to be lightly played with;\nand hysteria came only when duty flung him\ninto a hell of revelation too sudden and\ninsidious to escape.\n\nHe had for some time been detailed to\nthe Butler Street station in Brooklyn when\nthe Red Hook matter came to his notice.\nRed Hook is a maze of hybrid squalor near\nthe ancient waterfront opposite Governor's\nIsland, with dirty highways climbing the\nhill from the wharves to that higher ground\nwhere the decayed lengths of Clinton and\nCourt Streets lead off toward the Borough\nHall.  Its houses are mostly of brick, dating\nfrom the first quarter of the middle of the\nnineteenth century, and some of the\nobscurer alleys and byways have that alluring\nantique flavor which conventional reading\nleads us to call \"Dickensian.\"  The population\nis a hopeless tangle and enigma; Syrian,\nSpanish, Italian, and Negro elements\nimpinging upon one another, and fragments of\nScandinavian and American belts lying not\nfar distant.  It is a babel of sound and filth,\nand sends out strange cries to answer the\nlapping of oily waves at its grimy piers and\nthe monstrous organ litanies of the harbor\nwhistles.  Here long ago a brighter picture\ndwelt, with clear-eyed mariners on the lower\nstreets and homes of taste and substance\nwhere the larger houses line the hill.  One\ncan trace the relics of this former happiness\nin the trim shapes of the buildings, the\noccasional graceful churches and the evidences\nof original art and background in bits of\ndetail here and there\u00e2\u0080\u0094a worn flight of steps,\na battered doorway, a wormy pair of decorative\ncolumns or pilasters, or a fragment of\nonce green space with bent and rusted iron\nrailing.  The houses are generally in solid\nblocks, and now and then a many-windowed\ncupola arises to tell of days when the\nhouseholds of captains and ship-owners watched\nthe sea.\n\nFrom this tangle of material and spiritual\nputrescence the blasphemies of an hundred\ndialects assail the sky.  Hordes of prowlers\nreel shouting and singing along the lanes\nand thoroughfares, occasional furtive hands\nsuddenly extinguish lights and pull down\ncurtains, and swarthy, sin-pitted faces\ndisappear from windows when visitors pick their\nway through.  Policemen despair of order\nor reform, and seek rather to erect barriers\nprotecting the outside world from the contagion.\n\nThe clang of the patrol is answered\nby a kind of spectral silence, and such\nprisoners as are taken are never communicative.\nVisible offenses are as varied as the\nlocal dialects, and run the gamut from\nthe smuggling of rum and prohibited aliens\nthrough diverse stages of lawlessness and\nobscure vice to murder and mutilation in\ntheir most abhorrent guises.  That these\nvisible affairs are not more frequent is not\nto the neighborhood's credit, unless the\npower of concealment be an art demanding\ncredit.  More people enter Red Hook than\nleave it\u00e2\u0080\u0094or at least, than leave it by the\nlandward side\u00e2\u0080\u0094and those who are not\nloquacious are the likeliest to leave.\n\nMalone found in this state of things\na faint stench of secrets more terrible\nthan any of the sins denounced by citizens\nand bemoaned by priest and philanthropists.\nHe was conscious, as one who united\nimagination with scientific knowledge, that\nmodern people under lawless conditions\ntend uncannily to repeat the darkest\ninstinctive patterns of primitive half-ape\nsavagery in their daily life and ritual\nobservances; and he had often viewed with\nan anthropologist's shudder the chanting,\ncursing processions of blear-eyed and\npock-marked young men which wound their way\nalong in the dark small hours of morning.\nOne saw groups of these youths incessantly;\nsometimes in leering vigils on street corners,\nsometimes in doorways playing eerily on\ncheap instruments of music, sometimes in\nstupefied dozes or indecent dialogues around\ncafeteria tables near Borough Hall, and\nsometimes in whispering converse around\ndingy taxicabs drawn up at the high stoops\nof crumbling and closely shuttered old\nhouses.  They chilled and fascinated him\nmore than he dared confess to his associates\non the force, for he seemed to see in them\nsome monstrous thread of secret continuity;\nsome fiendish, cryptical and ancient pattern\nutterly beyond and below the sordid mass\nof facts and habits and haunts listed with\nsuch conscientious technical care by the\npolice.  They must be, he felt inwardly, the\nheirs of some shocking and primordial\ntradition; the sharers of debased and broken\nscraps from cults and ceremonies older than\nmankind.  Their coherence and definiteness\nsuggested it, and it showed in the singular\nsuspicion of order which lurked beneath\ntheir squalid disorder.  He had not read in\nvain such treatises as Miss Murray's Witch\nCult in Western Europe; and knew that up\nto recent years there had certainly survived\namong peasants and furtive folk a frightful\nand clandestine system of assemblies and\norgies descended from dark religions\nantedating the Aryan World, and appearing in\npopular legends as Black Masses and\nWitches' Sabbaths.  That these hellish\nvestiges of old Turanian-Asiatic magic and\nfertility-cults were even now wholly dead\nhe could not for a moment suppose, and\nhe frequently wondered how much older\nand how much blacker than the very worst\nof the muttered tales some of them might\nreally be.\n\nIII\n\nIt was the case of Robert Suydam which\ntook Malone to the heart of things in\nRed Hook.  Suydam was a lettered recluse\nof ancient Dutch family, possessed\noriginally of barely independent means, and\ninhabiting the spacious but ill-preserved\nmansion which his grandfather had built\nin Flatbush when that village was little\nmore then a pleasant group of Colonial\ncottages surrounding the steepled and\nivy-clad Reformed Church with its iron-railed\nyard of Netherlandish gravestones.  In this\nlonely house, set back from Martense Street\namidst a yard of venerable trees, Suydam\nhad read and brooded for some six decades\nexcept for a period a generation before,\nwhen he had sailed for the Old World\nand remained there out of sight for eight\nyears.  He could afford no servants, and\nwould admit but few visitors to his absolute\nsolitude; eschewing close friendships and\nreceiving his rare acquaintances in one of\nthe three ground-floor rooms, which he kept\nin order\u00e2\u0080\u0094a vast, high-ceiled library whose\nwalls were solidly packed with tattered\nbooks of ponderous, archaic, and vaguely\nrepellent aspect.  The growth of the town\nand its final absorption in the Brooklyn\ndistrict had meant nothing to Suydam, and\nhe had come to mean less and less to the\ntown.  Elderly people still pointed him out\non the streets, but to most of the recent\npopulation he was merely a queer, corpulent\nold fellow whose unkempt white hair,\nstubbly beard, shiny black clothes and\ngold-headed cane earned him an amused glance\nand nothing more.  Malone did not know\nhim by sight till duty called him to the\ncase, but had heard of him indirectly as a\nreally profound authority on medieval\nsuperstition, and had once idly meant to look\nup an out-of-print pamphlet of his on the\nKabbalah and the Faustus legend, which a\nfriend had quoted from memory.\n\nSuydam became a \"case\" when his distant\nand only relatives sought court pronouncements\non his sanity.  Their action seemed\nsudden to the outside world, but was really\nundertaken only after prolonged observation\nand sorrowful debate.  It was based on\ncertain odd changes in his speech and habits;\nwild references to impending wonders, and\nunaccountable hauntings of disreputable\nBrooklyn neighborhoods.  He had been\ngrowing shabbier and shabbier with the\nyears, and now prowled about like a\nveritable mendicant; seen occasionally by\nhumiliated friends in subway stations, or\nloitering on the benches around Borough Hall\nin conversation with groups of swarthy,\nevil-looking strangers.  When he spoke it was\nto babble of unlimited powers almost within\nhis grasp, and to repeat with knowing\nleers such mystical words of names as\n\"Sephiroth,\" \"Ashmodai\" and \"Samael.\"  The\ncourt action revealed that he was using\nup his income and wasting his principal\nin the purchase of curious tomes imported\nfrom London and Paris, and in the\nmaintenance of a squalid basement flat in the\nRed Hook district where he spent nearly\nevery night, receiving odd delegations of\nmixed rowdies and foreigners, and apparently\nconducting some kind of ceremonial\nservice behind the green blinds of secretive\nwindows.  Detectives assigned to follow him\nreported strange cries and chants and\nprancing of feet filtering out from these\nnocturnal rites, and shuddered at their peculiar\necstasy and abandon despite the commonness\nof weird orgies in that sodden section.\nWhen, however, the matter came to a\nhearing, Suydam managed to preserve his\nliberty.  Before the judge his manner grew\nurbane and reasonable, and he freely\nadmitted the queerness of demeanor and\nextravagant cast of language into which he\nhad fallen through excessive devotion to\nstudy and research.  He was, he said,\nengaged in the investigation of certain details\nof European tradition which required the\nclosest contact with foreign groups and\ntheir songs and folk dances.  The notion\nthat any low secret society was preying\nupon him, as hinted by his relatives, was\nobviously absurd; and showed how sadly\nlimited was their understanding of him and\nhis work.  Triumphing with his calm\nexplanations, he was suffered to depart\nunhindered; and the paid detectives of the\nSuydams, Corlears and Van Brunts were\nwithdrawn in resigned disgust.\n\nIt was here that an alliance of Federal\ninspectors and police, Malone with them,\nentered the case.  The law had watched the\nSuydam action with interest, and had in\nmany instances been called upon to aid the\nprivate detectives.  In this work it developed\nthat Suydam's new associates were among\nthe blackest and most vicious criminals of\nRed Hook's devious lanes, and that at least\na third of them were known and repeated\noffenders in the matter of thievery, disorder,\nand the importation of illegal immigrants.\nIndeed, it would not have been too much\nto say that the old scholar's particular circle\ncoincided almost perfectly with the worst of\nthe organized cliques which smuggled ashore\ncertain nameless and unclassified Asian\ndregs wisely turned back by Ellis Island.  In\nthe teeming rookeries of Parker Place\u00e2\u0080\u0094since\nrenamed\u00e2\u0080\u0094where Suydam had his\nbasement flat, there had grown up a very\nunusual colony of unclassified slant-eyed\nfolk who used the Arabic alphabet but\nwere eloquently repudiated by the great\nmass of Syrians in and around Atlantic\nAvenue.  They could all have been deported\nfor lack of credentials, but legalism is\nslow-moving, and one does not disturb Red Hook\nunless publicity forces one to.\n\nThese creatures attended a tumbledown\nstone church, used Wednesdays as a dance\nhall, which reared its Gothic buttresses\nnear the vilest part of the waterfront.\nClergy throughout Brooklyn denied the\nplace all standing and authenticity, and\npolicemen agreed with them when they\nlistened to the noises it emitted at night.\nMalone used to fancy he heard terrible\ncracked bass notes from a hidden organ\nfar underground when the church stood\nempty and unlighted, whilst all observers\ndreaded the shrieking and drumming which\naccompanied the visible services.  Suydam,\nwhen questioned, said he thought the ritual\nwas some remnant of Nestorian Christianity\ntinctured with the Shamanism of Tibet.\nMost of the people, he conjectured, were\nof Mongoloid stock, originating somewhere\nin or near Kurdistan\u00e2\u0080\u0094and Malone could\nnot help recalling that Kurdistan is the land\nof the Yezidees, last survivors of the Persian\ndevil-worshippers.  However this may have\nbeen, the stir of the Suydam investigation\nmade it certain that these unauthorized\nnewcomers were flooding Red Hook in\nincreasing numbers; entering through some\nmarine conspiracy unreached by revenue\nofficers and harbor police, overrunning\nParker Place and rapidly spreading up the\nhill, and welcomed with curious fraternalism\nby the other assorted denizens of the region.\nTheir squat figures and characteristic\nsquinting physiognomies grotesquely combined\nwith flashy American clothing, appeared\nmore and more numerously among the\nloafers and nomad gangsters of the Borough\nHall section; till at length it was deemed\nnecessary to compute their number, ascertain\ntheir sources and occupations, and find if\npossible a way to round them up and deliver\nthem to the proper immigration authorities.\nTo this task Malone was assigned by agreement\nof Federal and city forces, and as he\ncommenced his canvass of Red Hook he felt\npoised upon the brink of nameless terrors,\nwith the shabby, unkempt figure of Robert\nSuydam as archfiend and adversary.\n\nIV\n\nPolice methods are varied and ingenious.\nMalone, through unostentatious\nrambles, carefully casual conversations,\nwell-timed offers of hip-pocket liquor, and\njudicious dialogues with frightened prisoners,\nlearned many isolated facts about the\nmovement whose aspect had become so\nmenacing.  The newcomers were indeed Kurds,\nbut of a dialect obscure and puzzling to\nexact philology.  Such of them as worked\nlived mostly as dock-hands and unlicensed\npeddlers, though frequently serving in\nGreek restaurants and tending corner\nnewsstands.  Most of them, however, had no\nvisible means of support; and were\nobviously connected with underworld pursuits,\nof which smuggling and bootlegging were\nthe least indescribable.  They had come in\nsteamships, apparently tramp freighters, and\nhad been unloaded by stealth on moonless\nnights in rowboats which stole under a\ncertain wharf and followed a hidden canal\nand house Malone could not locate, for the\nmemories of his informants were exceedingly\nconfused, while their speech was to a\ngreat extent beyond even the ablest\ninterpreters; nor could he gain any real data on\nthe reasons for their systematic importation.\nThey were reticent about the exact spot from\nwhich they had come, and were never\nsufficiently off guard to reveal the agencies\nwhich had sought them out and directed\ntheir course.  Indeed, they developed\nsomething like acute fright when asked the\nreason for their presence.  Gangsters of other\nbreeds were equally taciturn, and the most\nthat could be gathered was that some god\nor great priesthood had promised them\nunheard-of powers and supernatural glories\nand rulerships in a strange land.\n\nThe attendance of both newcomers and\nold gangsters at Suydam's closely guarded\nnocturnal meetings was very regular, and\nthe police soon learned that the erstwhile\nrecluse had leased additional flats to\naccommodate such guests as knew his password;\nat last occupying three entire houses and\npermanently harboring many of his queer\ncompanions.  He spent but little time now\nat his Flatbush home, apparently going\nand coming only to obtain and return books;\nand his face and manner had attained an\nappalling pitch of wildness.  Malone twice\ninterviewed him, but was each time bruskly\nrepulsed.  He knew nothing, he said, of any\nmysterious plots or movements; and had no\nidea how the Kurds could have entered or\nwhat they wanted.  His business was to\nstudy undisturbed the folk-lore of all the\nimmigrants of the district; a business with\nwhich policemen had no legitimate concern.\nMalone mentioned his admiration for\nSuydam's old brochure on the Kabbalah and\nother myths, but the old man's softening\nwas only momentary.  He sensed an intrusion,\nand rebuffed his visitor in no uncertain\nway; till Malone withdrew disgusted,\nand turned to other channels of information.\n\nWhat Malone would have unearthed\ncould he have worked continuously on\nthe case, we shall never know.  As it was, a\nstupid conflict between city and Federal\nauthority suspended the investigation for\nseveral months, during which the detective was\nbusy with other assignments.  But at no time\ndid he lose interest, or fail to stand amazed\nat what began to happen to Robert Suydam.\nJust at the time when a wave of kidnappings\nand disappearances spread its excitement over\nNew York, the unkempt scholar embarked\nupon a metamorphosis as startling as it was\nabsurd.  One day he was seen near Borough\nHall with clean-shaved face, well-trimmed\nhair, and tastefully immaculate attire, and\non every day thereafter some obscure\nimprovement was noticed in him.  He\nmaintained his new fastidiousness without\ninterruption, added to it an unwonted sparkle\nof eye and crispness of speech, and began\nlittle by little to shed the corpulence which\nhad so long deformed him.  Now frequently\ntaken for less than his age, he acquired an\nelasticity of step and buoyancy of demeanor\nto match the new tradition, and showed a\ncurious darkening of the hair which\nsomehow did not suggest dye.  As the months\npassed, he commenced to dress less and less\nconservatively, and finally astonished his\nfew friends by renovating and redecorating\nhis Flatbush mansion, which he threw open\nin a series of receptions, summoning all the\nacquaintances he could remember, and\nextending a special welcome to the fully\nforgiven relatives who had lately sought his\nrestraint.  Some attended through curiosity,\nothers through duty; but all were suddenly\ncharmed by the dawning grace and urbanity\nof the former hermit.  He had, he asserted,\naccomplished most of his allotted work; and\nhaving just inherited some property from a\nhalf-forgotten European friend, was about\nto spend his remaining years in a brighter\nsecond youth which ease, care and diet had\nmade possible to him.  Less and less was he\nseen at Red Hook, and more and more did\nhe move in the society to which he was born.\nPolicemen noted a tendency of the gangsters\nto congregate at the old stone church and\ndancehall instead of at the basement flat in\nParker Place, though the latter and its recent\nannexes still overflowed with noxious life.\n\nThen two incidents occurred\u00e2\u0080\u0094wide\nenough apart, but both of intense interest\nin the case as Malone envisaged it.  One\nwas a quiet announcement in the Eagle of\nRobert Suydam's engagement to Miss\nCornelia Gerritsen of Bayside, a young woman\nof excellent position, and distantly related\nto the elderly bridegroom-elect; whilst the\nother was a raid on the dance-hall church\nby city police, after a report that the face of\na kidnapped child had been seen for a\nsecond at one of the basement windows.\nMalone had participated in this raid, and\nstudied the place with much care when\ninside.  Nothing was found\u00e2\u0080\u0094in fact, the\nbuilding was entirely deserted when visited\u00e2\u0080\u0094but\nthe sensitive Celt was vaguely disturbed by\nmany things about the interior.  There were\ncrudely painted panels he did not like\u00e2\u0080\u0094panels\nwhich depicted sacred faces with\npeculiarly worldly and sardonic expressions,\nand which occasionally took liberties that\neven a layman's sense of decorum could\nscarcely countenance.  Then, too, he did not\nrelish the Greek inscription on the wall\nabove the pulpit; an ancient incantation\nwhich he had once stumbled upon in Dublin\ncollege days, and which read, literally\ntranslated: \"O friend and companion of night,\nthou who rejoicest in the baying of dogs and\nspilt blood, who wanderest in the midst of\nshades among the tombs; who longest for\nblood and bringest terror to mortals, Gorge,\nMormo, thousand-faced moon, look favorably\non our sacrifices!\"\n\nWhen he read this he shuddered, and\nthought vaguely of the cracked bass\norgan-notes he fancied he had heard beneath the\nchurch on certain nights.  He shuddered\nagain at the rust around the rim of a metal\nbasin which stood on the altar, and paused\nnervously when his nostrils seemed to detect\na curious and ghastly stench from somewhere\nin the neighborhood.  That organ memory\nhaunted him, and he explored the basement\nwith particular assiduity before he left.  The\nplace was very hateful to him; yet after all,\nwere the blasphemous panels and inscriptions\nmore than mere crudities perpetrated\nby the ignorant?\n\nBy the time of Suydam's wedding the\nkidnapping epidemic had become a\npopular newspaper scandal.  Most of the\nvictims were young children of the lowest\nclasses, but the increasing number of\ndisappearances had worked up a sentiment of the\nstrongest fury.  Journals clamored for action\nfrom the police, and once more the Butler\nStreet station sent its men over Red Hook\nfor clues, discoveries, and criminals.  Malone\nwas glad to be on the trail again, and took\npride in a raid on one of Suydam's Parker\nPlace houses.  There, indeed, no stolen child\nwas found, despite the tales of screams and\nthe red sash picked up in the areaway; but\nthe paintings and rough inscriptions on the\npeeling walls of most of the rooms, and the\nprimitive chemical laboratory in the attic,\nall helped to convince the detective that he\nwas on the track of something tremendous.\nThe paintings were appalling\u00e2\u0080\u0094hideous\nmonsters of every shape and size, and parodies\non human outlines which cannot be\ndescribed.  The writing was in red, and varied\nfrom Arabic to Greek, Roman, and Hebrew\nletters.  Malone could not read much of it,\nbut what he did decipher was portentous\nand cabalistic enough.  One frequently\nrepeated motto was in a sort of Hebraized\nHellenistic Greek, and suggested the most\nterrible demon-evocations of the\nAlexandrian decadence:\n\nHEL.  HELOYM.  SOTHER.  EMMANVEL.\nSABOATH.  AGLA.  TETRAGRAMMATION.\nAGYROS.  OTHEOS.  ISCHYROS.\nATHANATOS.  IEHOVA.  VA.\nADONAL.  SADY.  HOMOVSION.\nMESSIAS.  ESCHEREHEYE.\n\nCircles and pentagrams loomed on every\nhand, and told indubitably of the strange\nbeliefs and aspirations of those who dwelt\nso squalidly here.  In the cellar, however, the\nstrangest thing was found\u00e2\u0080\u0094a pile of\ngenuine gold ingots covered carelessly with a\npiece of burlap, and bearing upon their\nshining surfaces the same weird hieroglyphics\nwhich also adorned the walls.  During this\nraid the police encountered only a passive\nresistance from the squinting Orientals that\nswarmed from every door.  Finding nothing\nrelevant, they had to leave all as it was; but\nthe precinct captain wrote Suydam a note,\nadvising him to look closely to the character\nof his tenants, and proteg\u00c3\u00a9s in view of the\ngrowing public clamor.\n\nV\n\nThen came the June wedding and the\ngreat sensation; Flatbush was gay for the\nhour about high noon, and pennanted\nmotors thronged the street near the old\nDutch church where an awning stretched\nfrom door to highway.  No local event ever\nsurpassed the Suydam-Gerritsen nuptials in\ntone and scale, and the party which escorted\nthe bride and groom to the Cunard pier\nwas, if not exactly the smartest, at least a\nsolid page from the Social Register!  At 5\no'clock adieux was waved, and the ponderous\nliner edged away from the long pier,\nslowly turned its nose seaward, discarded\nits tug, and headed for widening water\nspaces that led to Old World wonders.  By\nnight the outer harbor was cleared, and late\npassengers watched the stars twinkling\nabove an unpolluted ocean.\n\nWhether the tramp steamer or the scream\nwas first to gain attention, no one can say.\nProbably they were simultaneous, but it is\nof no use to calculate.  The scream came\nfrom the Suydam stateroom, and the sailor\nwho broke down the door could perhaps\nhave told frightful things if he had not\nforthwith gone completely mad\u00e2\u0080\u0094as it is, he\nshrieked more loudly than the first victims,\nand thereafter ran simpering about the\nvessel till caught and put in irons.  The ship's\ndoctor who entered the stateroom and\nturned on the lights a moment later did not\ngo mad, but told nobody what he saw till\nafterward, when he corresponded with\nMalone in Chepachet.  It was murder\u00e2\u0080\u0094strangulation\u00e2\u0080\u0094but\none need not say that the claw-mark\non Mrs. Suydam's throat could not\nhave come from her husband's or any other\nhuman hand, or that upon the white wall\nthere flickered for an instant in hateful red\na legend which, later copied from memory,\nseems to have been nothing less than the\nfearsome Chaldee letters of the word\n\"LILITH.\"  One need not mention these\nthings because they vanished so quickly\u00e2\u0080\u0094as\nfor Suydam, one could at least bar others\nfrom the room until one knew what to think\noneself.  The doctor has distinctly assured\nMalone that he did not see IT.  The open\nporthole, just before he turned on the lights,\nwas clouded for a second with a certain\nphosphorescence, and for a moment there\nseemed to echo in the night outside the\nsuggestion of a faint and hellish tittering; but\nno real outline met the eye.  As proof, the\ndoctor points to his continued sanity.\n\nThen the tramp steamer claimed all attention.\nA boat put off, and a horde of swart,\ninsolent ruffians in officers' dress swarmed\naboard the temporarily halted Cunarder.\nThey wanted Suydam or his body\u00e2\u0080\u0094they had\nknown of his trip, and for certain reasons\nwere sure he would die.  The captain's deck\nwas almost a pandemonium; for at the\ninstant, between the doctor's report from the\nstateroom and the demands of the men from\nthe tramp, not even the wisest and gravest\nseaman could think what to do.  Suddenly\nthe leader of the visiting mariners, an Arab\nwith a hatefully negroid mouth, pulled forth\na dirty, crumpled paper and handed it to the\ncaptain.  It was signed by Robert Suydam,\nand bore the following odd message:\n\nIn case of sudden or unexpected accident\nor death on my part, please deliver me or\nmy body unquestioningly into the hands of\nthe bearer and his associates.  Everything, for\nme, and perhaps for you, depends on absolute\ncompliance.  Explanations can come\nlater\u00e2\u0080\u0094do not fail me now.\n\nRobert Suydam.\n\nCaptain and doctor looked at each\nother, and the latter whispered something\nto the former.  Finally they nodded\nrather helplessly and led the way to the\nSuydam stateroom.  The doctor directed the\ncaptain's glance away as he unlocked the\ndoor and admitted the strange seamen, nor\ndid he breathe easily, till they filed out with\ntheir burden after an unaccountably long\nperiod of preparation.  It was wrapped in\nbedding from the berths, and the doctor was\nglad that the outlines were not very\nrevealing.  Somehow the men got the thing over\nthe side and away to their tramp steamer\nwithout uncovering it.\n\nThe Cunarder started again, and the\ndoctor and ship's undertaker sought out the\nSuydam stateroom to perform what last\nservices they could.  Once more the physician\nwas forced to reticence and even to mendacity,\nfor a hellish thing had happened.\nWhen the undertaker asked him why he had\ndrained off all of Mrs. Suydam's blood, he\nneglected to affirm that he had not done so;\nnor did he point to the vacant bottle-spaces\non the rack, or to the odor in the sink which\nshowed the hasty disposition of the bottles'\noriginal contents.  The pockets of those\nmen\u00e2\u0080\u0094if men they were\u00e2\u0080\u0094had bulged damnably\nwhen they left the ship.  Two hours later,\nand the world knew by radio all that it\nought to know of the horrible affair.\n\nVI\n\nThat same June evening, without having\nheard a word from the sea, Malone was\nvery busy among the alleys of Red Hook.\nA sudden stir seemed to permeate the place,\nand as if apprized by \"grapevine telegraph\"\nof something singular, the denizens\nclustered expectantly around the dance-hall\nchurch and the houses in Parker Place.\nThree children had just disappeared\u00e2\u0080\u0094blue-eyed\nNorwegians from the streets toward\nGowanus\u00e2\u0080\u0094and there were rumors of a mob\nforming among the sturdy Viking of that\nsection.  Malone had for weeks been urging\nhis colleagues to attempt a general clean-up;\nand at last, moved by conditions more obvious\nto their common sense than the conjectures\nof a Dublin dreamer, they had agreed\nupon a final stroke.  The unrest and menace\nof this evening had been the deciding\nfactor, and just about midnight a raiding party\nrecruited from three stations descended\nupon Parker Place and its environs.  Doors\nwere battered in, stragglers arrested, and\ncandle-lighted rooms forced to disgorge\nunbelievable throngs of mixed foreigners in\nfigured robes, miters and other inexplicable\ndevices.  Much was lost in the m\u00c3\u00aal\u00c3\u00a9e for\nobjects were thrown hastily down unexpected\nshafts, and betraying odors deadened by the\nsudden kindling of pungent incense.  But\nspattered blood was everywhere, and\nMalone shuddered whenever he saw a brazier\nor altar from which the smoke was still\nrising.\n\nHe wanted to be in several places at once,\nand decided on Suydam's basement flat only\nafter a messenger had reported the complete\nemptiness of the dilapidated dance-hall\nchurch.  The flat, he thought, must hold\nsome clue to a cult of which the occult\nscholar had so obviously become the center\nand leader; and it was with real expectancy\nthat he ransacked the musty rooms, noted\ntheir vaguely charnal odor, and examined\nthe curious books, instruments, gold ingots,\nand glass-stoppered bottles scattered\ncarelessly here and there.  Once a lean,\nblack-and-white cat edged between his feet and\ntripped him, overturning at the same time a\nbeaker half full of red liquid.  The shock\nwas severe, and to this day Malone is not\ncertain of what he saw; but in dreams he\nstill pictures that cat as it scuttled away with\ncertain monstrous alterations and peculiarities.\n\nThen came the locked cellar door, and\nthe search for something to break it\ndown.  A heavy stool stood near, and its\ntough seat was more than enough for the\nantique panels.  A crack formed and\nenlarged, and the whole door gave way\u00e2\u0080\u0094but\nfrom the other side; whence poured a howling\ntumult of ice-cold wind with all the stenches\nof the bottomless pit, and whence\nreached a sucking force not of earth or\nheaven, which, coiling sentiently about the\nparalyzed detective, dragged him through\nthe aperture and down unmeasured spaces\nfilled with whispers and wails, and gusts of\nmocking laughter.\n\nOf course it was a dream.  All the specialists\nhave told him so, and he has nothing\ntangible to prove the contrary.  Indeed, he\nwould rather have it thus; for then the sight\nof old brick slums and dark foreign faces\nwould not eat so deeply into his soul.  But at\nthe time it was all horribly real, and nothing\ncan ever efface the memory of those nighted\ncrypts, those titan arcades, and those\nhalf-formed shapes of hell that strode\ngigantically in silence holding half-eaten things\nwhose still surviving portions screamed for\nmercy or laughed with madness.  Odors of\nincense and corruption joined in sickening\nconcert, and the black air was alive with the\ncloudy, semi-visible bulk of shapeless\nelemental things with eyes.  Somewhere dark\nsticky water was lapping at onyx piers, and\nonce the shivery tinkle of raucous little bells\npealed out to greet the insane titter of a\nnaked phosphorescent thing which swam\ninto sight, scrambled ashore, and climbed\nup to squat leeringly on a carved golden\npedestal in the black ground.\n\nAvenues of limitless night seemed to radiate\nin every direction, till one might fancy\nthat here lay the root of a contagion destined\nto sicken and swallow cities, and engulf\nnations in the fetor of hybrid pestilence.\nHere cosmic sin had entered, and festered\nby unhallowed rites had commenced the\ngrinning march of death that was to rot us\nall to fungus abnormalities too hideous for\nthe grave's holding.  Satan here held his\nBabylonish court, and in the blood of\nstainless childhood the leprous limbs of\nphosphorescent Lilith were laved.  Incubi and\nsuccubae howled praise to Hecate, and\nheadless mooncalves bleated to the Magna\nMater.  Goats leaped to the sound of thin\naccursed flutes, and AEgipans chased\nendlessly after misshapen fauns over rocks\ntwisted like swollen toads.  Moloch and\nAshtaroth were not absent; for in this\nquintessence of all damnation the bounds of\nconsciousness were let down, and man's fancy\nlay open to vistas of every realm of horror\nand every forbidden dimension that evil had\npower to mold.  The world and nature were\nhelpless against such assaults from unsealed\nwells of night, nor could any sign or prayer\ncheck the Walpurgissage of horror which\nhad come when a sage with the hateful\nlocked and brimming coffer of transmitted\ndemon-lore.\n\nSuddenly a ray of physical light shot\nthrough these fantasms, and Malone heard\nthe sound of oars amidst the blasphemies of\nthings that should be dead.  A boat with a\nlantern in its prow darted into sight, made\nfast to an iron ring in the slimy stone pier,\nand vomited forth several dark men bearing\na long burden swathed in bedding.  They\ntook it to the naked phosphorescent thing\non the carved gold pedestal, and the thing\ntittered and pawed the bedding.  Then they\nunswathed it, and propped upright before\nthe pedestal the gangrenous corpse of a\ncorpulent old man with stubby beard and\nunkempt white hair.  The phosphorescent\nthing tittered again, and the men produced\nbottles from their pockets and anointed its\nfeet with red, whilst they afterward gave\nthe bottles to the thing to drink from.\n\nAll at once, from an arcaded avenue leading\nendlessly away, there came the demoniac\nrattle and wheeze of a blasphemous organ,\nchoking and rumbling out of the mockeries\nof hell in cracked, sardonic bass.  In an\ninstant every moving entity was electrified;\nand forming at once into a ceremonial\nprocession, the nightmare horde slithered away\nin quiet of the sound\u00e2\u0080\u0094goat, satyr, and\nAEgipan, incubus, succuba, and lemur,\ntwisted toad and shapeless elemental,\ndog-faced howler and silent strutter in\ndarkness\u00e2\u0080\u0094all led by the abominable naked\nphosphorescent thing that had squatted on\nthe carved golden throne; and that now\nstrode insolently bearing in its arms the\nglassy-eyed corpse of the corpulent old\nman.  The strange dark man danced in the\nrear, and the whole column skipped and\nleaped with Dionysiac fury.  Malone\nstaggered after them a few steps, delirious\nand hazy, and doubtful of his place in\nthis or any world.  Then he turned, faltered,\nand sank down on the cold damp stone,\ngasping and shivering as the demon organ\ncroaked on, and the howling and drumming\nand tinkling of the mad procession grew\nfainter and fainter.\n\nVaguely he was conscious of chanted\nhorrors, and shocking croakings afar off.\nNow and then a wail or whine of ceremonial\ndevotion would float to him through\nthe black arcade, whilst eventually there\nrose the dreadful Greek incantation whose\ntext he had read above the pulpit of that\ndance-hall church.\n\n\"O friend and companion of night thou\nwho rejoicest in the baying of dogs (here\na hideous howl burst forth) and spilt\nblood (here nameless sounds vied with\nmorbid shriekings), who wanderest in the\nmidst of shades among the tombs (here\na whistling sigh occurred), who longest\nfor blood and bringest terror to mortals\n(short, sharp cries from myriad throats),\nGorgo (repeated as response), Mormo\n(repeated with ecstasy), thousand-faced\nmoon (sighs and flute notes), look\nfavorably on our sacrifices!\"\n\nAs the chant closed, a general shout\nwent up, and hissing sounds nearly drowned\nthe croaking of the cracked bass organ.\nThen a gasp as from many throats, and\na babel of barked and bleated words\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"Lilith,\nGreat Lilith, behold the Bridegroom!\"  More\ncries, a clamor of rioting,\nand the sharp, clicking footfalls of a\nrunning figure.  The footfalls approached, and\nMalone raised himself to his elbow to look.\n\nThe luminosity of the crypt, lately\ndiminished, had now slightly increased;\nand in that devil-light there appeared the\nfleeing form of that which should not\nflee or feel or breathe\u00e2\u0080\u0094the glassy-eyed,\ngangrenous corpse of the corpulent old\nman, now needing no support, but animated\nby some infernal sorcery of the rite just\nclosed.  After it raced the naked, tittering,\nphosphorescent thing that belonged on the\ncarven pedestal, and still farther behind\npanted the dark men, and all the dread crew\nof sentient loathsomenesses.  The corpse\nwas gaining on its pursuers, and seemed\nbent on a definite object, straining with\nevery rotting muscle toward the carved\ngolden pedestal, whose necromantic\nimportance was evidently so great.  Another\nmoment and it had reached its goal, whilst\nthe trailing throng labored on with more\nfrantic speed.  But they were too late, for\nin one final spurt of strength which ripped\ntendon from tendon and sent its noisome\nbulk floundering to the floor in a state of\njellyish dissolution, the staring corpse which\nhad been Robert Suydam achieved its\nobject and its triumph.  The push had been\ntremendous, but the force had held out;\nand as the pusher collapsed to a muddy\nblotch of corruption the pedestal he had\npushed tottered, tipped, and finally careened\nfrom its onyx base into the thick waters\nbelow, sending up a parting gleam of carven\ngold as it sank heavily to undreamable\ngulfs of lower Tartarus.  In that instant,\ntoo, the whole scene of horror faded to\nnothingness before Malone's eyes; and he\nfainted amidst a thunderous crash which\nseemed to blot out all the evil universe.\n\nVII\n\nMalone's dream, experienced in full\nbefore he knew of Suydam's death and\ntransfer at sea, was curiously supplemented\nby some oddities of the case; though that\nis no reason why anyone should believe it.\nThe three old houses in Parker Place,\ndoubtless long rotten with decay in its most\ninsidious form, collapsed without visible\ncause while half the raiders and most of\nthe prisoners were inside; and both of the\ngreater number were instantly killed.  Only\nin the basements and cellars was there\nmuch saving of life, and Malone was lucky\nto have been deep below the house of\nRobert Suydam.  For he really was there,\nas no one is disposed to deny.  They found\nhim unconscious by the edge of the\nnight-black pool, with a grotesquely horrible\njumble of decay and bone, identifiable\nthrough dental work as the body of Suydam,\na few feet away.  The case was plain, for\nit was hither that the smugglers'\nunderground canal led; and the men who took\nSuydam from the ship had brought him\nhome.  They themselves were never found,\nor identified; and the ship's doctor is not yet\nsatisfied with the certitudes of the police.\n\nSuydam was evidently a leader in\nextensive man-smuggling operations, for the\ncanal to his house was but one of several\nsubterranean channels and tunnels in the\nneighborhood.  There was a tunnel from\nthis house to a crypt beneath the\ndance-hall church; a crypt accessible from the\nchurch only through a narrow secret passage\nin the north wall, and in whose chambers\nsome singular and terrible things were\ndiscovered.  The croaking organ was there,\nas well as a vast arched chapel with wooden\nbenches and a strangely figured altar.  The\nwalls were lined with small cells, in\nseventeen of which\u00e2\u0080\u0094hideous to relate\u00e2\u0080\u0094solitary\nprisoners in a state of complete idiocy\nwere found chained, including four mothers\nwith infants of disturbingly strange\nappearance.  These infants died soon after\nexposure to the light; a circumstance which\nthe doctors thought rather merciful.  Nobody\nbut Malone, among those who inspected\nthem, remembered the somber question of\nold Delrio: \"An sint unquan daemones\nincubi et succubae, et an ex tali, congressu\nproles nasci queat?\"\n\nBefore the canals were filled up they\nwere thoroughly dredged, and yielded\nforth a sensational array of sawed and split\nbones of all sizes.  The kidnapping epidemic,\nvery clearly, had been traced home; though\nonly two of the surviving prisoners could\nby any legal thread be connected with it.\nThese men are now in prison, since they\nfailed of conviction as accessories in the\nactual murders.  The carved golden pedestal\nor throne so often mentioned by Malone\nas of primary occult importance was never\nbrought to light, though at one place under\nthe Suydam house the canal, was observed\nto sink into a well too deep for dredging.\nIt was choked up at the mouth and cemented\nover when the cellars of the new houses\nwere made, but Malone often speculates\non what lied beneath.  The police, satisfied\nthat they had shattered a dangerous gang\nof maniacs and alien smugglers, turned over\nto the Federal authorities the unconvicted\nKurds, who before their deportation were\nconclusively found to belong to the Yezidee\nclan of devils-worshippers.  The tramp ship\nand its crew remain an elusive mystery,\nthough cynical detectives are once more\nready to combat its smuggling and\nrum-running ventures.  Malone thinks these\ndetectives show a sadly limited perspective\nin their lack of wonder at the myriad\nunexplainable details, and the suggestive\nobscurity of the whole case; though he is\njust as critical of the newspapers, which\nsaw only a morbid sensation and gloated\nover a minor sadist cult when they might\nhave proclaimed a horror from the\nuniverse's very heart.  But he is content to rest\nsilent in Chepachet, calming his nervous\nsystem and praying that time may gradually\ntransfer his terrible experience from the\nrealm of present reality to that of\npicturesque and semi-mythical remoteness.\n\nRobert Suydam sleeps beside his bride\nin Greenwood Cemetery.  No funeral was\nheld over the strangely released bones,\nand relatives are grateful for the swift\noblivion which overtook the case as a\nwhole.\n\nThe scholar's connection with the Red\nHook horrors, indeed, was never emblazoned\nby legal proof; since his death forestalled the\ninquiry he would otherwise have faced.\nHis own end is not much mentioned, and\nthe Suydams hope that posterity may recall\nhim only as a gentle recluse who dabbled\nin harmless magic and folk-lore.\n\nAs for Red Hook\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is always the\nsame.  Suydam came and went; a terror\ngathered and faded; but the evil spirit of\ndarkness and squalor broods on amongst\nthe mongrels in the old brick houses; and\nprowling bands still parade on unknown\nerrands past windows where lights and\ntwisted faces unaccountably appear and\ndisappear.  Age-old horror is a hydra with a\nthousand heads, and the cults of darkness\nare rooted in blasphemies deeper than the\nwell of Democritus.  The soul of the beast\nis omnipresent and triumphant, and Red\nHook's legions of blear-eyed, pockmarked\nyouths still chant and curse and howl\nas they file from abyss to abyss, none knows\nwhence or whither, pushed on by blind\nlaws of biology which they may never\nunderstand.  As of old more people enter\nRed Hook than leave it on the landward\nside, and there are already rumors of new\ncanals running underground to certain\ncenters of traffic in liquor and less\nmentionable things.\n\nThe dance-hall church is now mostly a\ndance-hall, and queer faces have appeared\nat night at the windows.  Lately a policeman\nexpressed the belief that the filled-up\ncrypt has been dug out again, and for no\nsimply explainable purpose.  Who are we\nto combat poisons older than history and\nmankind?  Apes danced in Asia to those\nhorrors, and the cancer lurks secure and\nspreading where furtiveness hides in rows\nof decaying brick.\n\nMalone does not shudder without cause\u00e2\u0080\u0094for\nonly the other day an officer overheard\na swarthy squinting hag teaching a small\nchild some whispering patois in the shadow\nof an areaway.  He listened, and thought\nit very strange when he heard her repeat\nover and over again:\n\n\"O friend and companion of night thou\nwho rejoicest in the baying of dogs and\nspilt blood, who wanderest in the midst\nof shades among the tombs, who longest\nfor blood and bringest terror to mortals,\nGorgo, Mormo, thousand-faced moon, look\nfavorably on our sacrifices!\"",
