    "name": "Sherlock Holmes - The Adventure of the Copper Beeches",
    "body": "\n\u201cTo the man who\r\nloves art for its own sake,\u201d remarked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside the\r\nadvertisement sheet of The Daily Telegraph, \u201cit is frequently in\r\nits least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to\r\nbe derived. It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far\r\ngrasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have\r\nbeen good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish,\r\nyou have given prominence not so much to the many causes c\u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a8bres and\r\nsensational trials in which I have figured but rather to those incidents which\r\nmay have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those\r\nfaculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special\r\nprovince.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d said I, smiling, \u201cI cannot quite hold myself\r\nabsolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my\r\nrecords.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have erred, perhaps,\u201d he observed, taking up a glowing cinder\r\nwith the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to\r\nreplace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative\r\nmood\u2014\u201cyou have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life\r\ninto each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of\r\nplacing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really\r\nthe only notable feature about the thing.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,\u201d I\r\nremarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more\r\nthan once observed to be a strong factor in my friend\u2019s singular\r\ncharacter.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, it is not selfishness or conceit,\u201d said he, answering, as was\r\nhis wont, my thoughts rather than my words. \u201cIf I claim full justice for\r\nmy art, it is because it is an impersonal thing\u2014a thing beyond myself.\r\nCrime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon\r\nthe crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a\r\ncourse of lectures into a series of tales.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either\r\nside of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down\r\nbetween the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like\r\ndark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and\r\nshone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not\r\nbeen cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping\r\ncontinuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at\r\nlast, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet\r\ntemper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAt the same time,\u201d he remarked after a pause, during which he had\r\nsat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, \u201cyou can\r\nhardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you\r\nhave been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of\r\ncrime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to\r\nhelp the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the\r\nproblem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the incident of the\r\nnoble bachelor, were all matters which are outside the pale of the law. But in\r\navoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have bordered on the\r\ntrivial.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe end may have been so,\u201d I answered, \u201cbut the methods I\r\nhold to have been novel and of interest.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public,\r\nwho could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb,\r\ncare about the finer shades of analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are\r\ntrivial, I cannot blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or\r\nat least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As to my own\r\nlittle practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost\r\nlead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think\r\nthat I have touched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks\r\nmy zero-point, I fancy. Read it!\u201d He tossed a crumpled letter across to\r\nme.\r\n\n\r\nIt was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran thus:\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDEAR MR. HOLMES,\u2014I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I\r\nshould or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as\r\ngoverness. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do not inconvenience\r\nyou. Yours faithfully,\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVIOLET HUNTER.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you know the young lady?\u201d I asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot I.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is half-past ten now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember that\r\nthe affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first,\r\ndeveloped into a serious investigation. It may be so in this case, also.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for here,\r\nunless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAs he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was plainly\r\nbut neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover\u2019s\r\negg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in\r\nthe world.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,\u201d said she, as my\r\ncompanion rose to greet her, \u201cbut I have had a very strange experience,\r\nand as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice,\r\nI thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should\r\ndo.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I\r\ncan to serve you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of\r\nhis new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion, and then composed\r\nhimself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together, to listen to her\r\nstory.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have been a governess for five years,\u201d said she, \u201cin the\r\nfamily of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an\r\nappointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to America\r\nwith him, so that I found myself without a situation. I advertised, and I\r\nanswered advertisements, but without success. At last the little money which I\r\nhad saved began to run short, and I was at my wit\u2019s end as to what I\r\nshould do.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called\r\nWestaway\u2019s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see\r\nwhether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the name of\r\nthe founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits\r\nin her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an\r\nanteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers and\r\nsees whether she has anything which would suit them.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as\r\nusual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout man\r\nwith a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon\r\nfold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose,\r\nlooking very earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a\r\njump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That will do,\u2019 said he; \u2018I could not ask for\r\nanything better. Capital! capital!\u2019 He seemed quite enthusiastic and\r\nrubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a\r\ncomfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You are looking for a situation, miss?\u2019 he asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, sir.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018As governess?\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, sir.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And what salary do you ask?\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I had \u00c2\u00a3 4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence\r\nMunro.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, tut, tut! sweating\u2014rank sweating!\u2019 he\r\ncried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling\r\npassion. \u2018How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such\r\nattractions and accomplishments?\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you\r\nimagine,\u2019 said I. \u2018A little French, a little German, music, and\r\ndrawing\u2014\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Tut, tut!\u2019 he cried. \u2018This is all quite beside\r\nthe question. The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment\r\nof a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted for\r\nthe rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history\r\nof the country. But if you have, why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to\r\ncondescend to accept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me,\r\nmadam, would commence at \u00c2\u00a3 100 a year.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an\r\noffer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps\r\nthe look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a note.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is also my custom,\u2019 said he, smiling in the most\r\npleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the\r\nwhite creases of his face, \u2018to advance to my young ladies half their\r\nsalary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey\r\nand their wardrobe.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a\r\nman. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great\r\nconvenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction\r\nwhich made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018May I ask where you live, sir?\u2019 said I.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five\r\nmiles on the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear\r\nyoung lady, and the dearest old country-house.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they\r\nwould be.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018One child\u2014one dear little romper just six years old.\r\nOh, if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack!\r\nsmack! Three gone before you could wink!\u2019 He leaned back in his chair and\r\nlaughed his eyes into his head again.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was a little startled at the nature of the child\u2019s amusement,\r\nbut the father\u2019s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018My sole duties, then,\u2019 I asked, \u2018are to take\r\ncharge of a single child?\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young\r\nlady,\u2019 he cried. \u2018Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense\r\nwould suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always\r\nthat they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no\r\ndifficulty, heh?\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I should be happy to make myself useful.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people,\r\nyou know\u2014faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress\r\nwhich we might give you, you would not object to our little whim. Heh?\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No,\u2019 said I, considerably astonished at his words.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive\r\nto you?\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, no.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to\r\nus?\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my hair\r\nis somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut. It has been\r\nconsidered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand\r\nfashion.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I am afraid that that is quite impossible,\u2019 said I.\r\nHe had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow\r\npass over his face as I spoke.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I am afraid that it is quite essential,\u2019 said he.\r\n\u2018It is a little fancy of my wife\u2019s, and ladies\u2019 fancies, you\r\nknow, madam, ladies\u2019 fancies must be consulted. And so you won\u2019t\r\ncut your hair?\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, sir, I really could not,\u2019 I answered firmly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a\r\npity, because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In that\r\ncase, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a\r\nword to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her\r\nface that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission\r\nthrough my refusal.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?\u2019\r\nshe asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018If you please, Miss Stoper.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the\r\nmost excellent offers in this fashion,\u2019 said she sharply. \u2018You can\r\nhardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you.\r\nGood-day to you, Miss Hunter.\u2019 She struck a gong upon the table, and I\r\nwas shown out by the page.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough\r\nin the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table, I began to ask myself\r\nwhether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all, if these people had\r\nstrange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they\r\nwere at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few governesses in\r\nEngland are getting \u00c2\u00a3 100 a year. Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many\r\npeople are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be among the\r\nnumber. Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the\r\nday after I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back\r\nto the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received this\r\nletter from the gentleman himself. I have it here and I will read it to you:\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.\r\n\u201c\u2018DEAR MISS HUNTER,\u2014Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your\r\naddress, and I write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your\r\ndecision. My wife is very anxious that you should come, for she has been much\r\nattracted by my description of you. We are willing to give \u00c2\u00a3 30 a quarter, or \u00c2\u00a3\r\n120 a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads\r\nmay cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife is fond of a\r\nparticular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress\r\nindoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing\r\none, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia),\r\nwhich would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or\r\nthere, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no\r\ninconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as I\r\ncould not help remarking its beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid\r\nthat I must remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased\r\nsalary may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child is\r\nconcerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the\r\ndog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train. Yours faithfully,\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018JEPHRO RUCASTLE.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind\r\nis made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before taking the\r\nfinal step I should like to submit the whole matter to your\r\nconsideration.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the\r\nquestion,\u201d said Holmes, smiling.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you would not advise me to refuse?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a\r\nsister of mine apply for.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed some\r\nopinion?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle\r\nseemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his wife is\r\na lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be\r\ntaken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to\r\nprevent an outbreak?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is a possible solution\u2014in fact, as matters stand, it is the\r\nmost probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for\r\na young lady.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, yes, of course the pay is good\u2014too good. That is what makes\r\nme uneasy. Why should they give you \u00c2\u00a3 120 a year, when they could have their\r\npick for \u00c2\u00a3 40? There must be some strong reason behind.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand\r\nafterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I felt that\r\nyou were at the back of me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your\r\nlittle problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for\r\nsome months. There is something distinctly novel about some of the features. If\r\nyou should find yourself in doubt or in danger\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDanger! What danger do you foresee?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHolmes shook his head gravely. \u201cIt would cease to be a danger if we could\r\ndefine it,\u201d said he. \u201cBut at any time, day or night, a telegram\r\nwould bring me down to your help.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is enough.\u201d She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety\r\nall swept from her face. \u201cI shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my\r\nmind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair\r\nto-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow.\u201d With a few grateful words\r\nto Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAt least,\u201d said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the\r\nstairs, \u201cshe seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care\r\nof herself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd she would need to be,\u201d said Holmes gravely. \u201cI am much\r\nmistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt was not very long before my friend\u2019s prediction was fulfilled. A\r\nfortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her\r\ndirection and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely\r\nwoman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light\r\nduties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or\r\nwhether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my\r\npowers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half\r\nan hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the\r\nmatter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. \u201cData! data!\r\ndata!\u201d he cried impatiently. \u201cI can\u2019t make bricks without\r\nclay.\u201d And yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his\r\nshould ever have accepted such a situation.\r\n\n\r\nThe telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I was\r\nthinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night\r\nchemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I would leave him\r\nstooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him in the same\r\nposition when I came down to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow\r\nenvelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJust look up the trains in Bradshaw,\u201d said he, and turned back to\r\nhis chemical studies.\r\n\n\r\nThe summons was a brief and urgent one.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPlease be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday\r\nto-morrow,\u201d it said. \u201cDo come! I am at my wit\u2019s end.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHUNTER.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWill you come with me?\u201d asked Holmes, glancing up.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI should wish to.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJust look it up, then.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere is a train at half-past nine,\u201d said I, glancing over my\r\nBradshaw. \u201cIt is due at Winchester at 11:30.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis\r\nof the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the morning.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBy eleven o\u2019clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old\r\nEnglish capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down,\r\nbut after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them down and began to\r\nadmire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with\r\nlittle fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was\r\nshining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which\r\nset an edge to a man\u2019s energy. All over the countryside, away to the\r\nrolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and grey roofs of the\r\nfarm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre they not fresh and beautiful?\u201d I cried with all the enthusiasm\r\nof a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.\r\n\n\r\nBut Holmes shook his head gravely.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you know, Watson,\u201d said he, \u201cthat it is one of the curses\r\nof a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference\r\nto my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are\r\nimpressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which comes to\r\nme is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be\r\ncommitted there.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d I cried. \u201cWho would associate crime with\r\nthese dear old homesteads?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson,\r\nfounded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not\r\npresent a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful\r\ncountryside.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou horrify me!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do in\r\nthe town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile that the\r\nscream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard\u2019s blow, does not\r\nbeget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then the whole\r\nmachinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it\r\ngoing, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at\r\nthese lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor\r\nignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish\r\ncruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such\r\nplaces, and none the wiser. Had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to\r\nlive in Winchester, I should never have had a fear for her. It is the five\r\nmiles of country which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not\r\npersonally threatened.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. She has her freedom.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat can be the matter, then? Can you suggest no\r\nexplanation?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover\r\nthe facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can only be\r\ndetermined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for\r\nus. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that\r\nMiss Hunter has to tell.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance from the\r\nstation, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. She had engaged a\r\nsitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am so delighted that you have come,\u201d she said earnestly.\r\n\u201cIt is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should\r\ndo. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPray tell us what has happened to you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to\r\nbe back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning, though he\r\nlittle knew for what purpose.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLet us have everything in its due order.\u201d Holmes thrust his long\r\nthin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no\r\nactual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to them to say\r\nthat. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my mind about\r\nthem.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat can you not understand?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTheir reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it\r\noccurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in his\r\ndog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it\r\nis not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house,\r\nwhitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are\r\ngrounds round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes\r\ndown to the Southampton high road, which curves past about a hundred yards from\r\nthe front door. This ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all\r\nround are part of Lord Southerton\u2019s preserves. A clump of copper beeches\r\nimmediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was\r\nintroduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no truth,\r\nMr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms\r\nat Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to be a silent,\r\npale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should\r\nthink, while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their conversation I\r\nhave gathered that they have been married about seven years, that he was a\r\nwidower, and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has\r\ngone to Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she\r\nhad left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As\r\nthe daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that her\r\nposition must have been uncomfortable with her father\u2019s young wife.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in\r\nfeature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a\r\nnonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her\r\nhusband and to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered continually from\r\none to the other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible. He\r\nwas kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they\r\nseemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman.\r\nShe would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face.\r\nMore than once I have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it\r\nwas the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never\r\nmet so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small for\r\nhis age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His whole life\r\nappears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy\r\nintervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to\r\nbe his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning\r\nthe capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would rather not talk\r\nabout the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my\r\nstory.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am glad of all details,\u201d remarked my friend, \u201cwhether they\r\nseem to you to be relevant or not.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant thing\r\nabout the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and conduct of the\r\nservants. There are only two, a man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name,\r\nis a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell\r\nof drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet\r\nMr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong\r\nwoman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They\r\nare a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the\r\nnursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFor two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very\r\nquiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered\r\nsomething to her husband.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, yes,\u2019 said he, turning to me, \u2018we are very\r\nmuch obliged to you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to\r\ncut your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from\r\nyour appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you.\r\nYou will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so\r\ngood as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue.\r\nIt was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs\r\nof having been worn before. It could not have been a better fit if I had been\r\nmeasured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of\r\nit, which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for me\r\nin the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire\r\nfront of the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair\r\nhad been placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it.\r\nIn this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the\r\nother side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that\r\nI have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I laughed\r\nuntil I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of\r\nhumour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad,\r\nanxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked\r\nthat it was time to commence the duties of the day, and that I might change my\r\ndress and go to little Edward in the nursery.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTwo days later this same performance was gone through under exactly\r\nsimilar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and\r\nagain I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an\r\nimmense r\u00c3\u00a9pertoire, and which he told inimitably. Then he handed me a\r\nyellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow\r\nmight not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for\r\nabout ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in\r\nthe middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what the\r\nmeaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They were always\r\nvery careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the window, so that I\r\nbecame consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back. At\r\nfirst it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror\r\nhad been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the\r\nglass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I\r\nput my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see\r\nall that there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was\r\nnothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance, however,\r\nI perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small\r\nbearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The road\r\nis an important highway, and there are usually people there. This man, however,\r\nwas leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking\r\nearnestly up. I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find\r\nher eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am\r\nconvinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what\r\nwas behind me. She rose at once.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Jephro,\u2019 said she, \u2018there is an impertinent\r\nfellow upon the road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?\u2019 he asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, I know no one in these parts.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion\r\nto him to go away.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Surely it would be better to take no notice.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly\r\nturn round and wave him away like that.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down the\r\nblind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in the\r\nwindow, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPray continue,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cYour narrative promises to be\r\na most interesting one.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be\r\nlittle relation between the different incidents of which I speak. On the very\r\nfirst day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small\r\nouthouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the\r\nsharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Look in here!\u2019 said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit\r\nbetween two planks. \u2018Is he not a beauty?\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague\r\nfigure huddled up in the darkness.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Don\u2019t be frightened,\u2019 said my employer,\r\nlaughing at the start which I had given. \u2018It\u2019s only Carlo, my\r\nmastiff. I call him mine, but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who\r\ncan do anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so\r\nthat he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and\r\nGod help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness\u2019 sake\r\ndon\u2019t you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night,\r\nfor it\u2019s as much as your life is worth.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out\r\nof my bedroom window about two o\u2019clock in the morning. It was a beautiful\r\nmoonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and\r\nalmost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the\r\nscene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the\r\ncopper beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It was a\r\ngiant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle,\r\nand huge projecting bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into\r\nthe shadow upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart\r\nwhich I do not think that any burglar could have done.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you\r\nknow, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the\r\nbottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse\r\nmyself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little\r\nthings. There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty\r\nand open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two with my linen, and\r\nas I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use\r\nof the third drawer. It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere\r\noversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first\r\nkey fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one thing\r\nin it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It was my coil of\r\nhair.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and the\r\nsame thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon\r\nme. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With trembling hands I\r\nundid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair.\r\nI laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was\r\nit not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it\r\nmeant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the\r\nmatter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening\r\na drawer which they had locked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I\r\nsoon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was one wing,\r\nhowever, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door which faced that\r\nwhich led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was\r\ninvariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr.\r\nRucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his\r\nface which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I\r\nwas accustomed. His cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and\r\nthe veins stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried\r\npast me without a word or a look.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds\r\nwith my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows\r\nof this part of the house. There were four of them in a row, three of which\r\nwere simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all\r\ndeserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr.\r\nRucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ah!\u2019 said he, \u2018you must not think me rude if I\r\npassed you without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business\r\nmatters.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI assured him that I was not offended. \u2018By the way,\u2019 said I,\r\n\u2018you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them\r\nhas the shutters up.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my\r\nremark.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Photography is one of my hobbies,\u2019 said he. \u2018I\r\nhave made my dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we\r\nhave come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed\r\nit?\u2019 He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he\r\nlooked at me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was\r\nsomething about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on fire\r\nto go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of that. It\r\nwas more a feeling of duty\u2014a feeling that some good might come from my\r\npenetrating to this place. They talk of woman\u2019s instinct; perhaps it was\r\nwoman\u2019s instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there,\r\nand I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that, besides\r\nMr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted\r\nrooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the\r\ndoor. Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very\r\ndrunk; and when I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt\r\nat all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs,\r\nand the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned\r\nthe key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted,\r\nwhich turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner were three\r\ndoors in a line, the first and third of which were open. They each led into an\r\nempty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the\r\nother, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them.\r\nThe centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been fastened one\r\nof the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall,\r\nand fastened at the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well,\r\nand the key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the\r\nshuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it\r\nthat the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a skylight which let in\r\nlight from above. As I stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and\r\nwondering what secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within\r\nthe room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of\r\ndim light which shone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose\r\nup in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and\r\nI turned and ran\u2014ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me\r\nclutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the\r\ndoor, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018So,\u2019 said he, smiling, \u2018it was you, then. I\r\nthought that it must be when I saw the door open.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, I am so frightened!\u2019 I panted.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018My dear young lady! my dear young lady!\u2019\u2014you\r\ncannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was\u2014\u2018and what\r\nhas frightened you, my dear young lady?\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was keenly\r\non my guard against him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,\u2019 I\r\nanswered. \u2018But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was\r\nfrightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Only that?\u2019 said he, looking at me keenly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why, what did you think?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why do you think that I lock this door?\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I am sure that I do not know.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you\r\nsee?\u2019 He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I am sure if I had known\u2014\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot\r\nover that threshold again\u2019\u2014here in an instant the smile hardened\r\ninto a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a\r\ndemon\u2014\u2018I\u2019ll throw you to the mastiff.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I must\r\nhave rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I found myself\r\nlying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could\r\nnot live there longer without some advice. I was frightened of the house, of\r\nthe man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all\r\nhorrible to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of course I\r\nmight have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as my\r\nfears. My mind was soon made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and\r\ncloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and\r\nthen returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind as\r\nI approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered that Toller\r\nhad drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening, and I knew that\r\nhe was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage\r\ncreature, or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and lay\r\nawake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you. I had no\r\ndifficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning, but I must be\r\nback before three o\u2019clock, for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a\r\nvisit, and will be away all the evening, so that I must look after the child.\r\nNow I have told you all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if\r\nyou could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHolmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My friend\r\nrose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an\r\nexpression of the most profound gravity upon his face.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs Toller still drunk?\u201d he asked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing with\r\nhim.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs there a cellar with a good strong lock?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, the wine-cellar.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave\r\nand sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one more\r\nfeat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite exceptional\r\nwoman.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will try. What is it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o\u2019clock, my friend and\r\nI. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be\r\nincapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If you\r\ncould send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon her,\r\nyou would facilitate matters immensely.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will do it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cExcellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course\r\nthere is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to\r\npersonate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber. That is\r\nobvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter,\r\nMiss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to America.\r\nYou were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the colour\r\nof your hair. Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some illness through\r\nwhich she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a\r\ncurious chance you came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly\r\nsome friend of hers\u2014possibly her fianc\u00c3\u00a9\u2014and no doubt, as you\r\nwore the girl\u2019s dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your\r\nlaughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss\r\nRucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions.\r\nThe dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate\r\nwith her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case is the\r\ndisposition of the child.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat on earth has that to do with it?\u201d I ejaculated.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to\r\nthe tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don\u2019t you see that\r\nthe converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first real insight\r\ninto the character of parents by studying their children. This child\u2019s\r\ndisposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty\u2019s sake, and whether\r\nhe derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his\r\nmother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,\u201d cried our client.\r\n\u201cA thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have\r\nhit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor\r\ncreature.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We\r\ncan do nothing until seven o\u2019clock. At that hour we shall be with you,\r\nand it will not be long before we solve the mystery.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWe were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the Copper\r\nBeeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The group of trees,\r\nwith their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting\r\nsun, were sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been standing\r\nsmiling on the door-step.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHave you managed it?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\n\r\nA loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. \u201cThat is Mrs.\r\nToller in the cellar,\u201d said she. \u201cHer husband lies snoring on the\r\nkitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr.\r\nRucastle\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have done well indeed!\u201d cried Holmes with enthusiasm.\r\n\u201cNow lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black\r\nbusiness.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWe passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and\r\nfound ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described.\r\nHolmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he tried the various\r\nkeys in the lock, but without success. No sound came from within, and at the\r\nsilence Holmes\u2019 face clouded over.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI trust that we are not too late,\u201d said he. \u201cI think, Miss\r\nHunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to\r\nit, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength.\r\nTogether we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture save a\r\nlittle pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The skylight above\r\nwas open, and the prisoner gone.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere has been some villainy here,\u201d said Holmes; \u201cthis\r\nbeauty has guessed Miss Hunter\u2019s intentions and has carried his victim\r\noff.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut how?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThrough the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.\u201d He\r\nswung himself up onto the roof. \u201cAh, yes,\u201d he cried,\r\n\u201chere\u2019s the end of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is\r\nhow he did it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut it is impossible,\u201d said Miss Hunter; \u201cthe ladder was not\r\nthere when the Rucastles went away.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and\r\ndangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I\r\nhear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be as well for you to\r\nhave your pistol ready.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the\r\nroom, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand. Miss Hunter\r\nscreamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes\r\nsprang forward and confronted him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou villain!\u201d said he, \u201cwhere\u2019s your daughter?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is for me to ask you that,\u201d he shrieked, \u201cyou thieves!\r\nSpies and thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I\u2019ll\r\nserve you!\u201d He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could\r\ngo.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone for the dog!\u201d cried Miss Hunter.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have my revolver,\u201d said I.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBetter close the front door,\u201d cried Holmes, and we all rushed down\r\nthe stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of\r\na hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying sound which it\r\nwas dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs\r\ncame staggering out at a side door.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy God!\u201d he cried. \u201cSomeone has loosed the dog. It\u2019s\r\nnot been fed for two days. Quick, quick, or it\u2019ll be too late!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHolmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller hurrying\r\nbehind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle buried in\r\nRucastle\u2019s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the ground. Running\r\nup, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth still\r\nmeeting in the great creases of his neck. With much labour we separated them\r\nand carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. We laid him upon\r\nthe drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the\r\nnews to his wife, I did what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled\r\nround him when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Toller!\u201d cried Miss Hunter.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up\r\nto you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn\u2019t let me know what you were\r\nplanning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHa!\u201d said Holmes, looking keenly at her. \u201cIt is clear that\r\nMrs. Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points on\r\nwhich I must confess that I am still in the dark.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will soon make it clear to you,\u201d said she; \u201cand I\u2019d\r\nhave done so before now if I could ha\u2019 got out from the cellar. If\r\nthere\u2019s police-court business over this, you\u2019ll remember that I was\r\nthe one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice\u2019s friend too.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn\u2019t, from the time that\r\nher father married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything, but\r\nit never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler at a\r\nfriend\u2019s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her\r\nown by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a\r\nword about them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle\u2019s hands. He knew\r\nhe was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward,\r\nwho would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought it\r\ntime to put a stop on it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she\r\nmarried or not, he could use her money. When she wouldn\u2019t do it, he kept\r\non worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at\r\ndeath\u2019s door. Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with\r\nher beautiful hair cut off; but that didn\u2019t make no change in her young\r\nman, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cI think that what you have been good\r\nenough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that\r\nremains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of\r\nimprisonment?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the\r\ndisagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat was it, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be,\r\nblockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments,\r\nmetallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same as\r\nhis.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,\u201d said\r\nMrs. Toller serenely.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of\r\ndrink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had\r\ngone out.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have it, sir, just as it happened.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,\u201d said Holmes,\r\n\u201cfor you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here\r\ncomes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had\r\nbest escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our locus\r\nstandi now is rather a questionable one.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches\r\nin front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept\r\nalive solely through the care of his devoted wife. They still live with their\r\nold servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle\u2019s past life that he\r\nfinds it difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were\r\nmarried, by special license, in Southampton the day after their flight, and he\r\nis now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to\r\nMiss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested\r\nno further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of\r\nhis problems, and she is now the head of a private school at Walsall, where I\r\nbelieve that she has met with considerable success.\r\n",
