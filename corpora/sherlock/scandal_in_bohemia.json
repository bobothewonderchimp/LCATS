    "name": "Sherlock Holmes - A Scandal in Bohemia",
    "body": "\nTo Sherlock Holmes she\nis always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other\nname. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was\nnot that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and\nthat one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably\nbalanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing\nmachine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in\na false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a\nsneer. They were admirable things for the observer\u2014excellent for drawing\nthe veil from men\u2019s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to\nadmit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was\nto introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental\nresults. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own\nhigh-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a\nnature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was\nthe late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.\n\n\nI had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each\nother. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up\naround the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were\nsufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of\nsociety with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street,\nburied among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine\nand ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen\nnature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and\noccupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in\nfollowing out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been\nabandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some\nvague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the\nTrepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson\nbrothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished\nso delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these\nsigns of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of\nthe daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\n\n\nOne night\u2014it was on the twentieth of March, 1888\u2014I was returning\nfrom a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my\nway led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which\nmust always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark\nincidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see\nHolmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His\nrooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare\nfigure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the\nroom swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped\nbehind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner\ntold their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his\ndrug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the\nbell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\n\n\nHis manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see\nme. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an\narmchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a\ngasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his\nsingular introspective fashion.\n\n\n\u201cWedlock suits you,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI think, Watson, that you\nhave put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSeven!\u201d I answered.\n\n\n\u201cIndeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I\nfancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you\nintended to go into harness.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen, how do you know?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself\nvery wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant\ngirl?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy dear Holmes,\u201d said I, \u201cthis is too much. You would\ncertainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that\nI had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I\nhave changed my clothes I can\u2019t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary\nJane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again,\nI fail to see how you work it out.\u201d\n\n\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\n\n\n\u201cIt is simplicity itself,\u201d said he; \u201cmy eyes tell me that on\nthe inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather\nis scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by\nsomeone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to\nremove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had\nbeen out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant\nboot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a\ngentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of\nnitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of\nhis top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull,\nindeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical\nprofession.\u201d\n\n\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of\ndeduction. \u201cWhen I hear you give your reasons,\u201d I remarked,\n\u201cthe thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could\neasily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am\nbaffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as\ngood as yours.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cQuite so,\u201d he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\ndown into an armchair. \u201cYou see, but you do not observe. The distinction\nis clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from\nthe hall to this room.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFrequently.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow often?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, some hundreds of times.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen how many are there?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow many? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cQuite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my\npoint. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and\nobserved. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and\nsince you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences,\nyou may be interested in this.\u201d He threw over a sheet of thick,\npink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table. \u201cIt came\nby the last post,\u201d said he. \u201cRead it aloud.\u201d\n\n\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address.\n\n\n\u201cThere will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight\no\u2019clock,\u201d it said, \u201ca gentleman who desires to consult you\nupon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the\nroyal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted\nwith matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This\naccount of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at\nthat hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThis is indeed a mystery,\u201d I remarked. \u201cWhat do you imagine\nthat it means?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has\ndata. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of\ntheories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?\u201d\n\n\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.\n\n\n\u201cThe man who wrote it was presumably well to do,\u201d I remarked,\nendeavouring to imitate my companion\u2019s processes. \u201cSuch paper could\nnot be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and\nstiff.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPeculiar\u2014that is the very word,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cIt is\nnot an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light.\u201d\n\n\nI did so, and saw a large \u201cE\u201d with a small \u201cg,\u201d a\n\u201cP,\u201d and a large \u201cG\u201d with a small \u201ct\u201d woven\ninto the texture of the paper.\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you make of that?\u201d asked Holmes.\n\n\n\u201cThe name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot at all. The \u2018G\u2019 with the small \u2018t\u2019 stands\nfor \u2018Gesellschaft,\u2019 which is the German for \u2018Company.\u2019\nIt is a customary contraction like our \u2018Co.\u2019 \u2018P,\u2019 of\ncourse, stands for \u2018Papier.\u2019 Now for the \u2018Eg.\u2019 Let us\nglance at our Continental Gazetteer.\u201d He took down a heavy brown volume\nfrom his shelves. \u201cEglow, Eglonitz\u2014here we are, Egria. It is in a\nGerman-speaking country\u2014in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad.\n\u2018Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its\nnumerous glass-factories and paper-mills.\u2019 Ha, ha, my boy, what do you\nmake of that?\u201d His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant\ncloud from his cigarette.\n\n\n\u201cThe paper was made in Bohemia,\u201d I said.\n\n\n\u201cPrecisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the\npeculiar construction of the sentence\u2014\u2018This account of you we have\nfrom all quarters received.\u2019 A Frenchman or Russian could not have\nwritten that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only\nremains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon\nBohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he\ncomes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.\u201d\n\n\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses\u2019 hoofs and grating wheels\nagainst the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.\n\n\n\u201cA pair, by the sound,\u201d said he. \u201cYes,\u201d he continued,\nglancing out of the window. \u201cA nice little brougham and a pair of\nbeauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There\u2019s money in this case,\nWatson, if there is nothing else.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think that I had better go, Holmes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And\nthis promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut your client\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNever mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit\ndown in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.\u201d\n\n\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage,\npaused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative\ntap.\n\n\n\u201cCome in!\u201d said Holmes.\n\n\nA man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in\nheight, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a\nrichness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy\nbands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his\ndouble-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his\nshoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a\nbrooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway\nup his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur,\ncompleted the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole\nappearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across\nthe upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard\nmask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still\nraised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a\nman of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin\nsuggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.\n\n\n\u201cYou had my note?\u201d he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly\nmarked German accent. \u201cI told you that I would call.\u201d He looked\nfrom one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\n\n\n\u201cPray take a seat,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThis is my friend and\ncolleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases.\nWhom have I the honour to address?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I\nunderstand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion,\nwhom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should\nmuch prefer to communicate with you alone.\u201d\n\n\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my\nchair. \u201cIt is both, or none,\u201d said he. \u201cYou may say before\nthis gentleman anything which you may say to me.\u201d\n\n\nThe Count shrugged his broad shoulders. \u201cThen I must begin,\u201d said\nhe, \u201cby binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of\nthat time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to\nsay that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European\nhistory.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI promise,\u201d said Holmes.\n\n\n\u201cAnd I.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou will excuse this mask,\u201d continued our strange visitor.\n\u201cThe august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you,\nand I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is\nnot exactly my own.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI was aware of it,\u201d said Holmes dryly.\n\n\n\u201cThe circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be\ntaken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously\ncompromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter\nimplicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI was also aware of that,\u201d murmured Holmes, settling himself down\nin his armchair and closing his eyes.\n\n\nOur visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure\nof the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner\nand most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked\nimpatiently at his gigantic client.\n\n\n\u201cIf your Majesty would condescend to state your case,\u201d he remarked,\n\u201cI should be better able to advise you.\u201d\n\n\nThe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable\nagitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face\nand hurled it upon the ground. \u201cYou are right,\u201d he cried; \u201cI\nam the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy, indeed?\u201d murmured Holmes. \u201cYour Majesty had not spoken\nbefore I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von\nOrmstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut you can understand,\u201d said our strange visitor, sitting down\nonce more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, \u201cyou can\nunderstand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person.\nYet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without\nputting myself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the\npurpose of consulting you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen, pray consult,\u201d said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\n\n\n\u201cThe facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit\nto Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler.\nThe name is no doubt familiar to you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cKindly look her up in my index, Doctor,\u201d murmured Holmes without\nopening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all\nparagraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a\nsubject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this\ncase I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and\nthat of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.\n\n\n\u201cLet me see!\u201d said Holmes. \u201cHum! Born in New Jersey in the\nyear 1858. Contralto\u2014hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of\nWarsaw\u2014yes! Retired from operatic stage\u2014ha! Living in\nLondon\u2014quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with\nthis young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of\ngetting those letters back.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPrecisely so. But how\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWas there a secret marriage?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNone.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo legal papers or certificates?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNone.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce\nher letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their\nauthenticity?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere is the writing.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPooh, pooh! Forgery.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy private note-paper.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStolen.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy own seal.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cImitated.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy photograph.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBought.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe were both in the photograph.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an\nindiscretion.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI was mad\u2014insane.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou have compromised yourself seriously.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt must be recovered.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe have tried and failed.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYour Majesty must pay. It must be bought.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe will not sell.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStolen, then.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFive attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her\nhouse. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been\nwaylaid. There has been no result.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo sign of it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAbsolutely none.\u201d\n\n\nHolmes laughed. \u201cIt is quite a pretty little problem,\u201d said he.\n\n\n\u201cBut a very serious one to me,\u201d returned the King reproachfully.\n\n\n\u201cVery, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the\nphotograph?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTo ruin me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut how?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am about to be married.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo I have heard.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTo Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of\nScandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herself\nthe very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the\nmatter to an end.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd Irene Adler?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThreatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that\nshe will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the\nface of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men.\nRather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she\nwould not go\u2014none.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou are sure that she has not sent it yet?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am sure.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd why?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBecause she has said that she would send it on the day when the\nbetrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, then we have three days yet,\u201d said Holmes with a yawn.\n\u201cThat is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to\nlook into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the\npresent?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCertainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count\nVon Kramm.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPray do so. I shall be all anxiety.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen, as to money?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou have carte blanche.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAbsolutely?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have\nthat photograph.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd for present expenses?\u201d\n\n\nThe King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on\nthe table.\n\n\n\u201cThere are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in\nnotes,\u201d he said.\n\n\nHolmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him.\n\n\n\u201cAnd Mademoiselle\u2019s address?\u201d he asked.\n\n\n\u201cIs Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John\u2019s Wood.\u201d\n\n\nHolmes took a note of it. \u201cOne other question,\u201d said he. \u201cWas\nthe photograph a cabinet?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt was.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some\ngood news for you. And good-night, Watson,\u201d he added, as the wheels of\nthe royal brougham rolled down the street. \u201cIf you will be good enough to\ncall to-morrow afternoon at three o\u2019clock I should like to chat this\nlittle matter over with you.\u201d\n\n\nAt three o\u2019clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet\nreturned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after\neight o\u2019clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with\nthe intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply\ninterested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim\nand strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have\nalready recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his\nclient gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the\ninvestigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly\ngrasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a\npleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle\nmethods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed\nwas I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had\nceased to enter into my head.\n\n\nIt was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom,\nill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes,\nwalked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my friend\u2019s amazing powers\nin the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it\nwas indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in\nfive minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into\nhis pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed\nheartily for some minutes.\n\n\n\u201cWell, really!\u201d he cried, and then he choked and laughed again\nuntil he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.\n\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I\nemployed my morning, or what I ended by doing.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits,\nand perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cQuite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I\nleft the house a little after eight o\u2019clock this morning in the character\nof a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among\nhorsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon\nfound Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but\nbuilt out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door.\nLarge sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost\nto the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child\ncould open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window\ncould be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and\nexamined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else\nof interest.\n\n\n\u201cI then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was\na mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers\na hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass\nof half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could\ndesire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the\nneighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies\nI was compelled to listen to.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd what of Irene Adler?\u201d I asked.\n\n\n\u201cOh, she has turned all the men\u2019s heads down in that part. She is\nthe daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews,\nto a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day,\nand returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except\nwhen she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark,\nhandsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is\na Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a\nconfidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and\nknew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to\nwalk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of\ncampaign.\n\n\n\u201cThis Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He\nwas a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between them, and\nwhat the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his\nmistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his\nkeeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question\ndepended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my\nattention to the gentleman\u2019s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate\npoint, and it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with\nthese details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to\nunderstand the situation.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am following you closely,\u201d I answered.\n\n\n\u201cI was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up\nto Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome man,\ndark, aquiline, and moustached\u2014evidently the man of whom I had heard. He\nappeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed\npast the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at\nhome.\n\n\n\u201cHe was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of\nhim in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly,\nand waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking\neven more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold\nwatch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, \u2018Drive like the\ndevil,\u2019 he shouted, \u2018first to Gross & Hankey\u2019s in Regent\nStreet, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a\nguinea if you do it in twenty minutes!\u2019\n\n\n\u201cAway they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to\nfollow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his\ncoat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his\nharness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn\u2019t pulled up before she\nshot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the\nmoment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.\n\n\n\u201c\u2018The Church of St. Monica, John,\u2019 she cried,\n\u2018and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.\u2019\n\n\n\u201cThis was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I\nshould run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came\nthrough the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped\nin before he could object. \u2018The Church of St. Monica,\u2019 said I,\n\u2018and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.\u2019 It was\ntwenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in\nthe wind.\n\n\n\u201cMy cabby drove fast. I don\u2019t think I ever drove faster, but the\nothers were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses\nwere in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the\nchurch. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a\nsurpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all\nthree standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle\nlike any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise,\nthe three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as\nhard as he could towards me.\n\n\n\u201c\u2018Thank God,\u2019 he cried. \u2018You\u2019ll do. Come!\nCome!\u2019\n\n\n\u201c\u2018What then?\u2019 I asked.\n\n\n\u201c\u2018Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won\u2019t be\nlegal.\u2019\n\n\n\u201cI was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I\nfound myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching\nfor things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying\nup of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an\ninstant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady\non the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most\npreposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the\nthought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been\nsome informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to\nmarry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved\nthe bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best\nman. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch chain in\nmemory of the occasion.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThis is a very unexpected turn of affairs,\u201d said I; \u201cand\nwhat then?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair\nmight take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic\nmeasures on my part. At the church door, however, they separated, he driving\nback to the Temple, and she to her own house. \u2018I shall drive out in the\npark at five as usual,\u2019 she said as she left him. I heard no more. They\ndrove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own\narrangements.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhich are?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSome cold beef and a glass of beer,\u201d he answered, ringing the\nbell. \u201cI have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be\nbusier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your\nco-operation.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI shall be delighted.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mind breaking the law?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot in the least.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNor running a chance of arrest?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot in a good cause.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, the cause is excellent!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen I am your man.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI was sure that I might rely on you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut what is it you wish?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhen Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you.\nNow,\u201d he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady\nhad provided, \u201cI must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time.\nIt is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss\nIrene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony\nLodge to meet her.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd what then?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur.\nThere is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come\nwhat may. You understand?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am to be neutral?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTo do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small\nunpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into the\nhouse. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open. You\nare to station yourself close to that open window.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd when I raise my hand\u2014so\u2014you will throw into the room\nwhat I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire.\nYou quite follow me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEntirely.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt is nothing very formidable,\u201d he said, taking a long\ncigar-shaped roll from his pocket. \u201cIt is an ordinary plumber\u2019s\nsmoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your\ntask is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up\nby quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I\nwill rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the\nsignal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you\nat the corner of the street.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPrecisely.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen you may entirely rely on me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare\nfor the new role I have to play.\u201d\n\n\nHe disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character\nof an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His broad black hat,\nhis baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of\npeering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have\nequalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression,\nhis manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed.\nThe stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he\nbecame a specialist in crime.\n\n\nIt was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten\nminutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was\nalready dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in\nfront of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was\njust such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes\u2019 succinct\ndescription, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On\nthe contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably\nanimated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a\ncorner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with\na nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down\nwith cigars in their mouths.\n\n\n\u201cYou see,\u201d remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the\nhouse, \u201cthis marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a\ndouble-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its\nbeing seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of\nhis princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhere, indeed?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet\nsize. Too large for easy concealment about a woman\u2019s dress. She knows\nthat the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of\nthe sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry\nit about with her.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhere, then?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHer banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am\ninclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do\ntheir own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could\ntrust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political\ninfluence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that\nshe had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her\nhands upon it. It must be in her own house.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut it has twice been burgled.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPshaw! They did not know how to look.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut how will you look?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI will not look.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI will get her to show me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut she will refuse.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her\ncarriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.\u201d\n\n\nAs he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of\nthe avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony\nLodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to\nopen the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another\nloafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out,\nwhich was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the\nloungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side.\nA blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her\ncarriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who\nstruck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into\nthe crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her, he gave a cry and\ndropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall\nthe guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the\nother, while a number of better dressed people, who had watched the scuffle\nwithout taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the\ninjured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps;\nbut she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of\nthe hall, looking back into the street.\n\n\n\u201cIs the poor gentleman much hurt?\u201d she asked.\n\n\n\u201cHe is dead,\u201d cried several voices.\n\n\n\u201cNo, no, there\u2019s life in him!\u201d shouted another. \u201cBut\nhe\u2019ll be gone before you can get him to hospital.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a brave fellow,\u201d said a woman. \u201cThey would have\nhad the lady\u2019s purse and watch if it hadn\u2019t been for him. They were\na gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he\u2019s breathing now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSurely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa.\nThis way, please!\u201d\n\n\nSlowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the\nprincipal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the\nwindow. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I\ncould see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized\nwith compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I\nnever felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the\nbeautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness\nwith which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest\ntreachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to\nme. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After\nall, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from\ninjuring another.\n\n\nHolmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in\nneed of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same\ninstant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the\nroom with a cry of \u201cFire!\u201d The word was no sooner out of my mouth\nthan the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill\u2014gentlemen,\nostlers, and servant maids\u2014joined in a general shriek of\n\u201cFire!\u201d Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at\nthe open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the\nvoice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping\nthrough the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in\nten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend\u2019s arm in mine, and to get away\nfrom the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes\nuntil we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the\nEdgeware Road.\n\n\n\u201cYou did it very nicely, Doctor,\u201d he remarked. \u201cNothing could\nhave been better. It is all right.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou have the photograph?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know where it is.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd how did you find out?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe showed me, as I told you she would.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am still in the dark.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI do not wish to make a mystery,\u201d said he, laughing. \u201cThe\nmatter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street\nwas an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI guessed as much.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm\nof my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became\na piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat also I could fathom.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could\nshe do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected.\nIt lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which. They\nlaid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window,\nand you had your chance.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow did that help you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her\ninstinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a\nperfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of\nit. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me, and\nalso in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an\nunmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady\nof to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in\nquest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done.\nThe smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded\nbeautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above\nthe right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it\nas she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she\nreplaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen\nher since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated\nwhether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come\nin, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. A little\nover-precipitance may ruin all.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd now?\u201d I asked.\n\n\n\u201cOur quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King to-morrow,\nand with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the\nsitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she\nmay find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his\nMajesty to regain it with his own hands.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd when will you call?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAt eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a\nclear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete\nchange in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without delay.\u201d\n\n\nWe had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was searching his\npockets for the key when someone passing said:\n\n\n\u201cGood-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.\u201d\n\n\nThere were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting\nappeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard that voice before,\u201d said Holmes, staring down the\ndimly lit street. \u201cNow, I wonder who the deuce that could have\nbeen.\u201d\n\n\nI slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and\ncoffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.\n\n\n\u201cYou have really got it!\u201d he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by\neither shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.\n\n\n\u201cNot yet.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut you have hopes?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI have hopes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen, come. I am all impatience to be gone.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe must have a cab.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, my brougham is waiting.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen that will simplify matters.\u201d We descended and started off\nonce more for Briony Lodge.\n\n\n\u201cIrene Adler is married,\u201d remarked Holmes.\n\n\n\u201cMarried! When?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYesterday.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut to whom?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTo an English lawyer named Norton.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut she could not love him.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am in hopes that she does.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd why in hopes?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBecause it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If the\nlady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does not love\nyour Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your\nMajesty\u2019s plan.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt is true. And yet\u2014! Well! I wish she had been of my own station!\nWhat a queen she would have made!\u201d He relapsed into a moody silence,\nwhich was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.\n\n\nThe door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps.\nShe watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.\n\n\n\u201cMr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?\u201d said she.\n\n\n\u201cI am Mr. Holmes,\u201d answered my companion, looking at her with a\nquestioning and rather startled gaze.\n\n\n\u201cIndeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left this\nmorning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for the\nContinent.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and\nsurprise. \u201cDo you mean that she has left England?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNever to return.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd the papers?\u201d asked the King hoarsely. \u201cAll is\nlost.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe shall see.\u201d He pushed past the servant and rushed into the\ndrawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was scattered\nabout in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the\nlady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at the\nbell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled\nout a photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in\nevening dress, the letter was superscribed to \u201cSherlock Holmes, Esq. To\nbe left till called for.\u201d My friend tore it open, and we all three read\nit together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this\nway:\n\n\n\u201cMY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,\u2014You really did it very well. You took\nme in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion. But\nthen, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been\nwarned against you months ago. I had been told that, if the King employed an\nagent, it would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with\nall this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became\nsuspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman.\nBut, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is\nnothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent\nJohn, the coachman, to watch you, ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as\nI call them, and came down just as you departed.\n\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u201cWell, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an\nobject of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather\nimprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my\nhusband.\n\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u201cWe both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by\nso formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call\nto-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am\nloved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without hindrance\nfrom one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and\nto preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might\ntake in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I\nremain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\n\n\n\u201cVery truly yours,\n\u201cIRENE NORTON, n\u00c3\u00a9e ADLER.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat a woman\u2014oh, what a woman!\u201d cried the King of Bohemia,\nwhen we had all three read this epistle. \u201cDid I not tell you how quick\nand resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a\npity that she was not on my level?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFrom what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very\ndifferent level to your Majesty,\u201d said Holmes coldly. \u201cI am sorry\nthat I have not been able to bring your Majesty\u2019s business to a more\nsuccessful conclusion.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, my dear sir,\u201d cried the King; \u201cnothing\ncould be more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is\nnow as safe as if it were in the fire.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am glad to hear your Majesty say so.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward\nyou. This ring\u2014\u201d He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger\nand held it out upon the palm of his hand.\n\n\n\u201cYour Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,\u201d\nsaid Holmes.\n\n\n\u201cYou have but to name it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThis photograph!\u201d\n\n\nThe King stared at him in amazement.\n\n\n\u201cIrene\u2019s photograph!\u201d he cried. \u201cCertainly, if you wish\nit.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I\nhave the honour to wish you a very good morning.\u201d He bowed, and, turning\naway without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him, he set\noff in my company for his chambers.\n\n\nAnd that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia,\nand how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman\u2019s\nwit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard\nhim do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her\nphotograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.\n",
