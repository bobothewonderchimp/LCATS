    "name": "Sherlock Holmes - A Case of Identity",
    "body": "\n\u201cMy dear\r\nfellow,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his\r\nlodgings at Baker Street, \u201clife is infinitely stranger than anything\r\nwhich the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the things\r\nwhich are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that\r\nwindow hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and\r\npeep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the\r\nplannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through\r\ngenerations, and leading to the most outr\u00c3\u00a9 results, it would make all\r\nfiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and\r\nunprofitable.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet I am not convinced of it,\u201d I answered. \u201cThe cases\r\nwhich come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar\r\nenough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and\r\nyet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor\r\nartistic.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic\r\neffect,\u201d remarked Holmes. \u201cThis is wanting in the police report,\r\nwhere more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than\r\nupon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole\r\nmatter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the\r\ncommonplace.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI smiled and shook my head. \u201cI can quite understand your thinking\r\nso,\u201d I said. \u201cOf course, in your position of unofficial adviser and\r\nhelper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you\r\nare brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But\r\nhere\u201d\u2014I picked up the morning paper from the\r\nground\u2014\u201clet us put it to a practical test. Here is the first\r\nheading upon which I come. \u2018A husband\u2019s cruelty to his wife.\u2019\r\nThere is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all\r\nperfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the\r\npush, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of\r\nwriters could invent nothing more crude.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,\u201d\r\nsaid Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. \u201cThis is the\r\nDundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some\r\nsmall points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no\r\nother woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the\r\nhabit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them\r\nat his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the\r\nimagination of the average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and\r\nacknowledge that I have scored over you in your example.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of\r\nthe lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life\r\nthat I could not help commenting upon it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh,\u201d said he, \u201cI forgot that I had not seen you for some\r\nweeks. It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my\r\nassistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd the ring?\u201d I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which\r\nsparkled upon his finger.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which I\r\nserved them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who have\r\nbeen good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd have you any on hand just now?\u201d I asked with interest.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSome ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest. They\r\nare important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed, I have found\r\nthat it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the\r\nobservation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the\r\ncharm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the\r\nbigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases,\r\nsave for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from\r\nMarseilles, there is nothing which presents any features of interest. It is\r\npossible, however, that I may have something better before very many minutes\r\nare over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing\r\ndown into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over his shoulder, I\r\nsaw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur\r\nboa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat\r\nwhich was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear.\r\nFrom under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at\r\nour windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers\r\nfidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who\r\nleaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of\r\nthe bell.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have seen those symptoms before,\u201d said Holmes, throwing his\r\ncigarette into the fire. \u201cOscillation upon the pavement always means an\r\naffaire de c\u00c5\u0093ur. She would like advice, but is not sure that the matter\r\nis not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may discriminate.\r\nWhen a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and\r\nthe usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a\r\nlove matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved.\r\nBut here she comes in person to resolve our doubts.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAs he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to\r\nannounce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small\r\nblack figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock\r\nHolmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and,\r\nhaving closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in\r\nthe minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you not find,\u201d he said, \u201cthat with your short sight it is\r\na little trying to do so much typewriting?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI did at first,\u201d she answered, \u201cbut now I know where the\r\nletters are without looking.\u201d Then, suddenly realising the full purport\r\nof his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and\r\nastonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard\r\nabout me, Mr. Holmes,\u201d she cried, \u201celse how could you know all\r\nthat?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d said Holmes, laughing; \u201cit is my business to\r\nknow things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not,\r\nwhy should you come to consult me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose\r\nhusband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for\r\ndead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I\u2019m not rich,\r\nbut still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that I\r\nmake by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr.\r\nHosmer Angel.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?\u201d asked\r\nSherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.\r\n\n\r\nAgain a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary\r\nSutherland. \u201cYes, I did bang out of the house,\u201d she said,\r\n\u201cfor it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr.\r\nWindibank\u2014that is, my father\u2014took it all. He would not go to the\r\npolice, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and\r\nkept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with\r\nmy things and came right away to you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour father,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cyour stepfather, surely, since\r\nthe name is different.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for\r\nhe is only five years and two months older than myself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd your mother is alive?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn\u2019t best pleased, Mr.\r\nHolmes, when she married again so soon after father\u2019s death, and a man\r\nwho was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the\r\nTottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother\r\ncarried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her\r\nsell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They\r\ngot \u00c2\u00a3 4700 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn\u2019t near as much as\r\nfather could have got if he had been alive.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and\r\ninconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the\r\ngreatest concentration of attention.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour own little income,\u201d he asked, \u201cdoes it come out of the\r\nbusiness?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in\r\nAuckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4\u00c2\u00bd per cent. Two thousand five\r\nhundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou interest me extremely,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cAnd since you draw\r\nso large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no\r\ndoubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a\r\nsingle lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about \u00c2\u00a3 60.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that\r\nas long as I live at home I don\u2019t wish to be a burden to them, and so\r\nthey have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of course,\r\nthat is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter\r\nand pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I\r\nearn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from\r\nfifteen to twenty sheets in a day.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have made your position very clear to me,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\u201cThis is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as\r\nbefore myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer\r\nAngel.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA flush stole over Miss Sutherland\u2019s face, and she picked nervously at\r\nthe fringe of her jacket. \u201cI met him first at the gasfitters\u2019\r\nball,\u201d she said. \u201cThey used to send father tickets when he was\r\nalive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr.\r\nWindibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would\r\nget quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this\r\ntime I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He\r\nsaid the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father\u2019s friends were\r\nto be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple\r\nplush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when\r\nnothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but\r\nwe went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was\r\nthere I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cthat when Mr. Windibank came back\r\nfrom France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and\r\nshrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman,\r\nfor she would have her way.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI see. Then at the gasfitters\u2019 ball you met, as I understand, a\r\ngentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had\r\ngot home all safe, and after that we met him\u2014that is to say, Mr. Holmes,\r\nI met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr.\r\nHosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, you know father didn\u2019t like anything of the sort. He\r\nwouldn\u2019t have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a\r\nwoman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to\r\nmother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine\r\nyet.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see\r\nyou?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote\r\nand said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had\r\ngone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I took\r\nthe letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWere you engaged to the gentleman at this time?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took.\r\nHosmer\u2014Mr. Angel\u2014was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall\r\nStreet\u2014and\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat office?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere did he live, then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe slept on the premises.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t know his address?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014except that it was Leadenhall Street.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere did you address your letters, then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He\r\nsaid that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other\r\nclerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like\r\nhe did his, but he wouldn\u2019t have that, for he said that when I wrote them\r\nthey seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that\r\nthe machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me,\r\nMr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think of.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was most suggestive,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cIt has long been an\r\naxiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you\r\nremember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the\r\nevening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very\r\nretiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He\u2019d had the\r\nquinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him\r\nwith a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was\r\nalways well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine\r\nare, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned to\r\nFrance?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should\r\nmarry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear,\r\nwith my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be true\r\nto him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign\r\nof his passion. Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder\r\nof him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began\r\nto ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to\r\ntell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I\r\ndidn\u2019t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his\r\nleave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn\u2019t want to do\r\nanything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has\r\nits French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the\r\nwedding.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt missed him, then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHa! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the\r\nFriday. Was it to be in church?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour\u2019s, near\r\nKing\u2019s Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras\r\nHotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he put us\r\nboth into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the\r\nonly other cab in the street. We got to the church first, and when the\r\nfour-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when\r\nthe cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there! The cabman\r\nsaid that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get\r\nin with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen\r\nor heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,\u201d said\r\nHolmes.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the\r\nmorning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that\r\neven if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to\r\nremember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner\r\nor later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened\r\nsince gives a meaning to it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMost certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen\r\ncatastrophe has occurred to him?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not\r\nhave talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut you have no notion as to what it could have been?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNone.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOne more question. How did your mother take the matter?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter\r\nagain.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd your father? Did you tell him?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and\r\nthat I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could anyone have\r\nin bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had\r\nborrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him,\r\nthere might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and\r\nnever would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened? And\r\nwhy could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I\r\ncan\u2019t sleep a wink at night.\u201d She pulled a little handkerchief out\r\nof her muff and began to sob heavily into it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI shall glance into the case for you,\u201d said Holmes, rising,\r\n\u201cand I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the\r\nweight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it\r\nfurther. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he\r\nhas done from your life.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen you don\u2019t think I\u2019ll see him again?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI fear not.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen what has happened to him?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate\r\ndescription of him and any letters of his which you can spare.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI advertised for him in last Saturday\u2019s Chronicle,\u201d\r\nsaid she. \u201cHere is the slip and here are four letters from him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThank you. And your address?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Angel\u2019s address you never had, I understand. Where is your\r\nfather\u2019s place of business?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of\r\nFenchurch Street.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave the\r\npapers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let the whole\r\nincident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true to\r\nHosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFor all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something noble in\r\nthe simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect. She laid her\r\nlittle bundle of papers upon the table and went her way, with a promise to come\r\nagain whenever she might be summoned.\r\n\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed\r\ntogether, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward\r\nto the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe,\r\nwhich was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his\r\nchair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of\r\ninfinite languor in his face.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQuite an interesting study, that maiden,\u201d he observed. \u201cI\r\nfound her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is\r\nrather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in\r\nAndover in \u201977, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last\r\nyear. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new\r\nto me. But the maiden herself was most instructive.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to\r\nme,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and\r\nso you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to realise the\r\nimportance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues\r\nthat may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that\r\nwoman\u2019s appearance? Describe it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather\r\nof a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a\r\nfringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than\r\ncoffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves\r\nwere greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I\r\ndidn\u2019t observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general\r\nair of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2019Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You\r\nhave really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everything\r\nof importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for\r\ncolour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself\r\nupon details. My first glance is always at a woman\u2019s sleeve. In a man it\r\nis perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this\r\nwoman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing\r\ntraces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses\r\nagainst the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand\r\ntype, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it\r\nfarthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as\r\nthis was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at\r\neither side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting,\r\nwhich seemed to surprise her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt surprised me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested on\r\nglancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not\r\nunlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly\r\ndecorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two\r\nlower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now,\r\nwhen you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from\r\nhome with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she\r\ncame away in a hurry.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd what else?\u201d I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my\r\nfriend\u2019s incisive reasoning.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but\r\nafter being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the\r\nforefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were\r\nstained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too\r\ndeep. It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon\r\nthe finger. All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back\r\nto business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised description of\r\nMr. Hosmer Angel?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI held the little printed slip to the light. \u201cMissing,\u201d it said,\r\n\u201con the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About\r\nfive ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a\r\nlittle bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted\r\nglasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in black\r\nfrock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and grey Harris\r\ntweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots. Known to have been\r\nemployed in an office in Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing,\u201d &c,\r\n&c.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat will do,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cAs to the letters,\u201d he\r\ncontinued, glancing over them, \u201cthey are very commonplace. Absolutely no\r\nclue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one\r\nremarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey are typewritten,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat little\r\n\u2018Hosmer Angel\u2019 at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no\r\nsuperscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The point about\r\nthe signature is very suggestive\u2014in fact, we may call it\r\nconclusive.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOf what?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon\r\nthe case?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny\r\nhis signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which\r\nshould settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the\r\nyoung lady\u2019s stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meet\r\nus here at six o\u2019clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well that we\r\nshould do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing\r\nuntil the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon\r\nthe shelf for the interim.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI had had so many reasons to believe in my friend\u2019s subtle powers of\r\nreasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have some\r\nsolid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the\r\nsingular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known\r\nhim to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler\r\nphotograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four,\r\nand the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt\r\nthat it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.\r\n\n\r\nI left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that\r\nwhen I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands\r\nall the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing\r\nbridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.\r\n\n\r\nA professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time,\r\nand the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. It was not\r\nuntil close upon six o\u2019clock that I found myself free and was able to\r\nspring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too\r\nlate to assist at the d\u00c3\u00a9nouement of the little mystery. I found Sherlock\r\nHolmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the\r\nrecesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with\r\nthe pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his\r\nday in the chemical work which was so dear to him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, have you solved it?\u201d I asked as I entered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, the mystery!\u201d I cried.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There was\r\nnever any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the\r\ndetails are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no law, I fear,\r\nthat can touch the scoundrel.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss\r\nSutherland?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lips\r\nto reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis is the girl\u2019s stepfather, Mr. James Windibank,\u201d said\r\nHolmes. \u201cHe has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come\r\nin!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of\r\nage, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a\r\npair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning\r\nglance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a\r\nslight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood-evening, Mr. James Windibank,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cI think\r\nthat this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with\r\nme for six o\u2019clock?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own\r\nmaster, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this\r\nlittle matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in\r\npublic. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very\r\nexcitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily\r\ncontrolled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind\r\nyou so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not\r\npleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a\r\nuseless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d said Holmes quietly; \u201cI have every reason\r\nto believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. \u201cI am\r\ndelighted to hear it,\u201d he said.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is a curious thing,\u201d remarked Holmes, \u201cthat a typewriter\r\nhas really quite as much individuality as a man\u2019s handwriting. Unless\r\nthey are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more\r\nworn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in this note\r\nof yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over\r\nof the \u2018e,\u2019 and a slight defect in the tail of the \u2018r.\u2019\r\nThere are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more\r\nobvious.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no\r\ndoubt it is a little worn,\u201d our visitor answered, glancing keenly at\r\nHolmes with his bright little eyes.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr.\r\nWindibank,\u201d Holmes continued. \u201cI think of writing another little\r\nmonograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It is\r\na subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have here four\r\nletters which purport to come from the missing man. They are all typewritten.\r\nIn each case, not only are the \u2018e\u2019s\u2019 slurred and the\r\n\u2018r\u2019s\u2019 tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my\r\nmagnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have\r\nalluded are there as well.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. \u201cI cannot\r\nwaste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,\u201d he said.\r\n\u201cIf you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the\r\ndoor. \u201cI let you know, then, that I have caught him!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat! where?\u201d shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and\r\nglancing about him like a rat in a trap.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, it won\u2019t do\u2014really it won\u2019t,\u201d said Holmes\r\nsuavely. \u201cThere is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is\r\nquite too transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it\r\nwas impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That\u2019s right! Sit\r\ndown and let us talk it over.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOur visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter of\r\nmoisture on his brow. \u201cIt\u2014it\u2019s not actionable,\u201d he\r\nstammered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves, Windibank,\r\nit was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came\r\nbefore me. Now, let me just run over the course of events, and you will\r\ncontradict me if I go wrong.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, like\r\none who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the\r\nmantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking,\r\nrather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe man married a woman very much older than himself for her\r\nmoney,\u201d said he, \u201cand he enjoyed the use of the money of the\r\ndaughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people\r\nin their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It\r\nwas worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable\r\ndisposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was\r\nevident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she\r\nwould not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of\r\ncourse, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent\r\nit? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to\r\nseek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would\r\nnot answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally\r\nannounced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her\r\nclever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head\r\nthan to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised\r\nhimself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a\r\nmoustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an\r\ninsinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl\u2019s short\r\nsight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making\r\nlove himself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was only a joke at first,\u201d groaned our visitor. \u201cWe never\r\nthought that she would have been so carried away.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly\r\ncarried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in\r\nFrance, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She\r\nwas flattered by the gentleman\u2019s attentions, and the effect was increased\r\nby the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call,\r\nfor it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a\r\nreal effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which\r\nwould finally secure the girl\u2019s affections from turning towards anyone\r\nelse. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys\r\nto France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the\r\nbusiness to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent\r\nimpression upon the young lady\u2019s mind and prevent her from looking upon\r\nany other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted\r\nupon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something\r\nhappening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss\r\nSutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate,\r\nthat for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man.\r\nAs far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther,\r\nhe conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a\r\nfour-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr.\r\nWindibank!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOur visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been\r\ntalking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said he, \u201cbut if\r\nyou are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who\r\nare breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from the\r\nfirst, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an\r\naction for assault and illegal constraint.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe law cannot, as you say, touch you,\u201d said Holmes, unlocking and\r\nthrowing open the door, \u201cyet there never was a man who deserved\r\npunishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a\r\nwhip across your shoulders. By Jove!\u201d he continued, flushing up at the\r\nsight of the bitter sneer upon the man\u2019s face, \u201cit is not part of\r\nmy duties to my client, but here\u2019s a hunting crop handy, and I think I\r\nshall just treat myself to\u2014\u201d He took two swift steps to the whip,\r\nbut before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs,\r\nthe heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr. James\r\nWindibank running at the top of his speed down the road.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a cold-blooded scoundrel!\u201d said Holmes, laughing, as\r\nhe threw himself down into his chair once more. \u201cThat fellow will rise\r\nfrom crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows.\r\nThe case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,\u201d I\r\nremarked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer Angel\r\nmust have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear\r\nthat the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see,\r\nwas the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together, but\r\nthat the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were\r\nthe tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise,\r\nas did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar\r\naction in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his\r\nhandwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest\r\nsample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones,\r\nall pointed in the same direction.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd how did you verify them?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHaving once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew the\r\nfirm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed description. I\r\neliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise\u2014the\r\nwhiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request\r\nthat they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of\r\ntheir travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter,\r\nand I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would\r\ncome here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same\r\ntrivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from\r\nWesthouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description\r\ntallied in every respect with that of their employ\u00c3\u00a9, James Windibank. Voil\u00c3\u00a0\r\ntout!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd Miss Sutherland?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old Persian\r\nsaying, \u2018There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger\r\nalso for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.\u2019 There is as much sense\r\nin Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world.\u201d\r\n",
