    "name": "Sherlock Holmes - The Boscombe Valley Mystery",
    "body": "\nWe were seated at\nbreakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a telegram. It\nwas from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:\n\n\n\u201cHave you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the\nwest of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad if\nyou will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the\n11:15.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, dear?\u201d said my wife, looking across at me.\n\u201cWill you go?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know what to say. I have a fairly long list at\npresent.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a\nlittle pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you are\nalways so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes\u2019 cases.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one\nof them,\u201d I answered. \u201cBut if I am to go, I must pack at once, for\nI have only half an hour.\u201d\n\n\nMy experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of making\nme a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and simple, so that in less\nthan the time stated I was in a cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington\nStation. Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt\nfigure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and\nclose-fitting cloth cap.\n\n\n\u201cIt is really very good of you to come, Watson,\u201d said he. \u201cIt\nmakes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can\nthoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed. If you\nwill keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.\u201d\n\n\nWe had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which\nHolmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read, with intervals\nof note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading. Then he suddenly\nrolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.\n\n\n\u201cHave you heard anything of the case?\u201d he asked.\n\n\n\u201cNot a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been\nlooking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars. It\nseems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so\nextremely difficult.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat sounds a little paradoxical.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue. The\nmore featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring\nit home. In this case, however, they have established a very serious case\nagainst the son of the murdered man.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt is a murder, then?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until\nI have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will explain the state\nof things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few\nwords.\n\n\n\u201cBoscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in\nHerefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner,\nwho made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country.\nOne of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles\nMcCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the\ncolonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they\nshould do so as near each other as possible. Turner was apparently the richer\nman, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of\nperfect equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad\nof eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of\nthem had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the\nneighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though both the\nMcCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of\nthe neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants\u2014a man and a girl. Turner\nhad a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. That is as much as\nI have been able to gather about the families. Now for the facts.\n\n\n\u201cOn June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at\nHatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool,\nwhich is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down\nthe Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his serving-man in the morning at\nRoss, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of\nimportance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came back alive.\n\n\n\u201cFrom Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile,\nand two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old woman,\nwhose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder, a game-keeper\nin the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was\nwalking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr.\nMcCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the same way with\na gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the father was actually in\nsight at the time, and the son was following him. He thought no more of the\nmatter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.\n\n\n\u201cThe two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the\ngame-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round,\nwith just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl of fourteen,\nPatience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley\nestate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She states that while she was\nthere she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy\nand his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. She heard\nMr. McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the\nlatter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by\ntheir violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that\nshe had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was\nafraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said the words when young\nMr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father\ndead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much\nexcited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were\nobserved to be stained with fresh blood. On following him they found the dead\nbody stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in\nby repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as\nmight very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son\u2019s gun,\nwhich was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these\ncircumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of\n\u2018wilful murder\u2019 having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he\nwas on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the\ncase to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out\nbefore the coroner and the police-court.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI could hardly imagine a more damning case,\u201d I remarked. \u201cIf\never circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCircumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,\u201d answered Holmes\nthoughtfully. \u201cIt may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if\nyou shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an\nequally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It must be\nconfessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young\nman, and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several\npeople in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the daughter\nof the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who have\nretained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection with the Study in\nScarlet, to work out the case in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled,\nhas referred the case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are\nflying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their\nbreakfasts at home.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am afraid,\u201d said I, \u201cthat the facts are so obvious that\nyou will find little credit to be gained out of this case.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,\u201d he\nanswered, laughing. \u201cBesides, we may chance to hit upon some other\nobvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know\nme too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm\nor destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or\neven of understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly\nperceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and yet I\nquestion whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as\nthat.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow on earth\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which\ncharacterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you shave by the\nsunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther\nback on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the\nangle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated\nthan the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in\nan equal light and being satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a\ntrivial example of observation and inference. Therein lies my m\u00c3\u00a9tier,\nand it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation\nwhich lies before us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out\nin the inquest, and which are worth considering.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat are they?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the\nreturn to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing him that\nhe was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that\nit was no more than his deserts. This observation of his had the natural effect\nof removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the\ncoroner\u2019s jury.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt was a confession,\u201d I ejaculated.\n\n\n\u201cNo, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cComing on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a\nmost suspicious remark.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cit is the brightest rift\nwhich I can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he\ncould not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances\nwere very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or\nfeigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious,\nbecause such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances,\nand yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His frank\nacceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a\nman of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark about his\ndeserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the\ndead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day\nso far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even,\naccording to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand\nas if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in\nhis remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a\nguilty one.\u201d\n\n\nI shook my head. \u201cMany men have been hanged on far slighter\nevidence,\u201d I remarked.\n\n\n\u201cSo they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat is the young man\u2019s own account of the matter?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there\nare one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find it here, and\nmay read it for yourself.\u201d\n\n\nHe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, and\nhaving turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the\nunfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred. I\nsettled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully.\nIt ran in this way:\n\n\n\u201cMr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and\ngave evidence as follows: \u2018I had been away from home for three days at\nBristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd.\nMy father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was informed by\nthe maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly\nafter my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of\nmy window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was not\naware in which direction he was going. I then took my gun and strolled out in\nthe direction of the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit\nwarren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the\ngame-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinking\nthat I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in front of me. When\nabout a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of \u201cCooee!\u201d which\nwas a usual signal between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and\nfound him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me\nand asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A conversation ensued which\nled to high words and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very\nviolent temper. Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him\nand returned towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards,\nhowever, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back\nagain. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly\ninjured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost instantly\nexpired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to Mr.\nTurner\u2019s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for\nassistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how\nhe came by his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and\nforbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no active enemies. I\nknow nothing further of the matter.\u2019\n\n\n\u201cThe Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?\n\n\n\u201cWitness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to\na rat.\n\n\n\u201cThe Coroner: What did you understand by that?\n\n\n\u201cWitness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was delirious.\n\n\n\u201cThe Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had this\nfinal quarrel?\n\n\n\u201cWitness: I should prefer not to answer.\n\n\n\u201cThe Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.\n\n\n\u201cWitness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you\nthat it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.\n\n\n\u201cThe Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to\nyou that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any\nfuture proceedings which may arise.\n\n\n\u201cWitness: I must still refuse.\n\n\n\u201cThe Coroner: I understand that the cry of \u2018Cooee\u2019 was a\ncommon signal between you and your father?\n\n\n\u201cWitness: It was.\n\n\n\u201cThe Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and\nbefore he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?\n\n\n\u201cWitness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.\n\n\n\u201cA Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you\nreturned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?\n\n\n\u201cWitness: Nothing definite.\n\n\n\u201cThe Coroner: What do you mean?\n\n\n\u201cWitness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open,\nthat I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague\nimpression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of\nme. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a\nplaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was\ngone.\n\n\n\u201c\u2018Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for\nhelp?\u2019\n\n\n\u201c\u2018Yes, it was gone.\u2019\n\n\n\u201c  \u2018You cannot say what it was?\u2019\n\n\n\u201c\u2018No, I had a feeling something was there.\u2019\n\n\n\u201c\u2018How far from the body?\u2019\n\n\n\u201c\u2018A dozen yards or so.\u2019\n\n\n\u201c\u2018And how far from the edge of the wood?\u2019\n\n\n\u201c\u2018About the same.\u2019\n\n\n\u201c\u2018Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen\nyards of it?\u2019\n\n\n\u201c\u2018Yes, but with my back towards it.\u2019\n\n\n\u201cThis concluded the examination of the witness.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d said I as I glanced down the column, \u201cthat the\ncoroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He\ncalls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having\nsignalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his\nconversation with his father, and his singular account of his father\u2019s\ndying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son.\u201d\n\n\nHolmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned\nseat. \u201cBoth you and the coroner have been at some pains,\u201d said he,\n\u201cto single out the very strongest points in the young man\u2019s favour.\nDon\u2019t you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much\nimagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause of\nquarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved\nfrom his own inner consciousness anything so outr\u00c3\u00a9 as a dying reference\nto a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach\nthis case from the point of view that what this young man says is true, and we\nshall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket\nPetrarch, and not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the\nscene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in\ntwenty minutes.\u201d\n\n\nIt was nearly four o\u2019clock when we at last, after passing through the\nbeautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at\nthe pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-like man, furtive and\nsly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown\ndustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic\nsurroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard.\nWith him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged\nfor us.\n\n\n\u201cI have ordered a carriage,\u201d said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of\ntea. \u201cI knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until\nyou had been on the scene of the crime.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt was very nice and complimentary of you,\u201d Holmes answered.\n\u201cIt is entirely a question of barometric pressure.\u201d\n\n\nLestrade looked startled. \u201cI do not quite follow,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\u201cHow is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the\nsky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is\nvery much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do not think that\nit is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.\u201d\n\n\nLestrade laughed indulgently. \u201cYou have, no doubt, already formed your\nconclusions from the newspapers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe case is as plain as\na pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still, of\ncourse, one can\u2019t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. She\nhas heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her\nthat there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done. Why,\nbless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.\u201d\n\n\nHe had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely\nyoung women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes shining, her lips\nparted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost\nin her overpowering excitement and concern.\n\n\n\u201cOh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!\u201d she cried, glancing from one to the\nother of us, and finally, with a woman\u2019s quick intuition, fastening upon\nmy companion, \u201cI am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to\ntell you so. I know that James didn\u2019t do it. I know it, and I want you to\nstart upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point.\nWe have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults\nas no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge\nis absurd to anyone who really knows him.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes.\n\u201cYou may rely upon my doing all that I can.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do you\nnot see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is\ninnocent?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think that it is very probable.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere, now!\u201d she cried, throwing back her head and looking\ndefiantly at Lestrade. \u201cYou hear! He gives me hopes.\u201d\n\n\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI am afraid that my colleague has been\na little quick in forming his conclusions,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\u201cBut he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And\nabout his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would not\nspeak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIn what way?\u201d asked Holmes.\n\n\n\u201cIt is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many\ndisagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a\nmarriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as brother and\nsister; but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet,\nand\u2014and\u2014well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that\nyet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd your father?\u201d asked Holmes. \u201cWas he in favour of such a\nunion?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of\nit.\u201d A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of\nhis keen, questioning glances at her.\n\n\n\u201cThank you for this information,\u201d said he. \u201cMay I see your\nfather if I call to-morrow?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am afraid the doctor won\u2019t allow it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe doctor?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years\nback, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed, and Dr.\nWillows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered. Mr.\nMcCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in\nVictoria.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHa! In Victoria! That is important.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, at the mines.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cQuite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made his\nmoney.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, certainly.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to\nme.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go to\nthe prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know him\nto be innocent.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI will, Miss Turner.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave\nhim. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.\u201d She hurried from\nthe room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her\ncarriage rattle off down the street.\n\n\n\u201cI am ashamed of you, Holmes,\u201d said Lestrade with dignity after a\nfew minutes\u2019 silence. \u201cWhy should you raise up hopes which you are\nbound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,\u201d said\nHolmes. \u201cHave you an order to see him in prison?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, but only for you and me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still\ntime to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAmple.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I\nshall only be away a couple of hours.\u201d\n\n\nI walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets\nof the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa\nand tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the\nstory was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we\nwere groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the action to\nthe fact, that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely\nto a consideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young\nman\u2019s story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what\nabsolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between\nthe time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his\nscreams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and deadly. What\ncould it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my\nmedical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper,\nwhich contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon\u2019s\ndeposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and\nthe left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a\nblunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have\nbeen struck from behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as\nwhen seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go\nfor very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow\nfell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes\u2019 attention to it.\nThen there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It\ncould not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become\ndelirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his\nfate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible\nexplanation. And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If\nthat were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress,\npresumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to\nreturn and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his\nback turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and\nimprobabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade\u2019s\nopinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes\u2019 insight that I\ncould not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his\nconviction of young McCarthy\u2019s innocence.\n\n\nIt was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for Lestrade\nwas staying in lodgings in the town.\n\n\n\u201cThe glass still keeps very high,\u201d he remarked as he sat down.\n\u201cIt is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go\nover the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and\nkeenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by\na long journey. I have seen young McCarthy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd what did you learn from him?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCould he throw no light?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNone at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had\ndone it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as\npuzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to\nlook at and, I should think, sound at heart.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI cannot admire his taste,\u201d I remarked, \u201cif it is indeed a\nfact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this\nMiss Turner.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly, insanely,\nin love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before he\nreally knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school, what\ndoes the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry\nher at a registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can\nimagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he\nwould give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible.\nIt was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air\nwhen his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss\nTurner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and his\nfather, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him over\nutterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent\nthe last three days in Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark\nthat point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however, for the\nbarmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be\nhanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has\na husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie\nbetween them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all\nthat he has suffered.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut if he is innocent, who has done it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points.\nOne is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and\nthat the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did\nnot know when he would return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to\ncry \u2018Cooee!\u2019 before he knew that his son had returned. Those are\nthe crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk about\nGeorge Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters until\nto-morrow.\u201d\n\n\nThere was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and\ncloudless. At nine o\u2019clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and\nwe set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.\n\n\n\u201cThere is serious news this morning,\u201d Lestrade observed. \u201cIt\nis said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired\nof.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAn elderly man, I presume?\u201d said Holmes.\n\n\n\u201cAbout sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad,\nand he has been in failing health for some time. This business has had a very\nbad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy\u2019s, and, I may add,\na great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm\nrent free.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIndeed! That is interesting,\u201d said Holmes.\n\n\n\u201cOh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about here\nspeaks of his kindness to him.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cReally! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy,\nwho appears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such\nobligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son to Turner\u2019s\ndaughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very\ncocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would\nfollow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself was averse to\nthe idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not deduce something from\nthat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe have got to the deductions and the inferences,\u201d said Lestrade,\nwinking at me. \u201cI find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without\nflying away after theories and fancies.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou are right,\u201d said Holmes demurely; \u201cyou do find it very\nhard to tackle the facts.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to\nget hold of,\u201d replied Lestrade with some warmth.\n\n\n\u201cAnd that is\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all\ntheories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,\u201d said Holmes,\nlaughing. \u201cBut I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon\nthe left.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, that is it.\u201d It was a widespread, comfortable-looking\nbuilding, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon\nthe grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a\nstricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We\ncalled at the door, when the maid, at Holmes\u2019 request, showed us the\nboots which her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the\nson\u2019s, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured these\nvery carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to be led\nto the court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which led to\nBoscombe Pool.\n\n\nSherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this. Men\nwho had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker Street would have\nfailed to recognise him. His face flushed and darkened. His brows were drawn\ninto two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a\nsteely glitter. His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips\ncompressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His\nnostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind\nwas so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or\nremark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick,\nimpatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track\nwhich ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool.\nIt was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of\nmany feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on\neither side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he\nmade quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him,\nthe detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the\ninterest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was\ndirected towards a definite end.\n\n\nThe Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards\nacross, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private\npark of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods which lined it upon the farther\nside we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich\nlandowner\u2019s dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew\nvery thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across\nbetween the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade\nshowed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so\nmoist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left\nby the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face\nand peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled\ngrass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon\nmy companion.\n\n\n\u201cWhat did you go into the pool for?\u201d he asked.\n\n\n\u201cI fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or\nother trace. But how on earth\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward\ntwist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among\nthe reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they\ncame like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party\nwith the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight\nfeet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same\nfeet.\u201d He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a\nbetter view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. \u201cThese\nare young McCarthy\u2019s feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly,\nso that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears\nout his story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the\nfather\u2019s feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the\nbutt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we\nhere? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go,\nthey come again\u2014of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they come\nfrom?\u201d He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track\nuntil we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great\nbeech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way to the\nfarther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of\nsatisfaction. For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and\ndried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and\nexamining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as\nfar as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also\nhe carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the wood\nuntil he came to the high road, where all traces were lost.\n\n\n\u201cIt has been a case of considerable interest,\u201d he remarked,\nreturning to his natural manner. \u201cI fancy that this grey house on the\nright must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran,\nand perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our\nluncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.\u201d\n\n\nIt was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into Ross,\nHolmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood.\n\n\n\u201cThis may interest you, Lestrade,\u201d he remarked, holding it out.\n\u201cThe murder was done with it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI see no marks.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere are none.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow do you know, then?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days. There\nwas no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds with the\ninjuries. There is no sign of any other weapon.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd the murderer?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled\nshooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and\ncarries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are several other indications,\nbut these may be enough to aid us in our search.\u201d\n\n\nLestrade laughed. \u201cI am afraid that I am still a sceptic,\u201d he said.\n\u201cTheories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed\nBritish jury.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNous verrons,\u201d answered Holmes calmly. \u201cYou work your\nown method, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall\nprobably return to London by the evening train.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd leave your case unfinished?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, finished.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut the mystery?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt is solved.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWho was the criminal, then?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe gentleman I describe.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut who is he?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSurely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a\npopulous neighbourhood.\u201d\n\n\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI am a practical man,\u201d he said,\n\u201cand I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a\nleft-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the laughing-stock of\nScotland Yard.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Holmes quietly. \u201cI have given you the\nchance. Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I\nleave.\u201d\n\n\nHaving left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we found lunch\nupon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained\nexpression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.\n\n\n\u201cLook here, Watson,\u201d he said when the cloth was cleared \u201cjust\nsit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don\u2019t\nknow quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar and let me\nexpound.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cPray do so.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, now, in considering this case there are two points about young\nMcCarthy\u2019s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they\nimpressed me in his favour and you against him. One was the fact that his\nfather should, according to his account, cry \u2018Cooee!\u2019 before seeing\nhim. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled several\nwords, you understand, but that was all that caught the son\u2019s ear. Now\nfrom this double point our research must commence, and we will begin it by\npresuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat of this \u2018Cooee!\u2019 then?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as\nfar as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within earshot.\nThe \u2018Cooee!\u2019 was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was\nthat he had the appointment with. But \u2018Cooee\u2019 is a distinctly\nAustralian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a strong\npresumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool\nwas someone who had been in Australia.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat of the rat, then?\u201d\n\n\nSherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the\ntable. \u201cThis is a map of the Colony of Victoria,\u201d he said. \u201cI\nwired to Bristol for it last night.\u201d He put his hand over part of the\nmap. \u201cWhat do you read?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cARAT,\u201d I read.\n\n\n\u201cAnd now?\u201d He raised his hand.\n\n\n\u201cBALLARAT.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cQuite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only\ncaught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his murderer.\nSo and so, of Ballarat.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt is wonderful!\u201d I exclaimed.\n\n\n\u201cIt is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down\nconsiderably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point which,\ngranting the son\u2019s statement to be correct, was a certainty. We have come\nnow out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Australian from\nBallarat with a grey cloak.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be\napproached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly\nwander.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cQuite so.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I\ngained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as to the\npersonality of the criminal.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut how did you gain them?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou know my method. It is founded upon the observation of\ntrifles.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHis height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his\nstride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, they were peculiar boots.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut his lameness?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left.\nHe put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped\u2014he was lame.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut his left-handedness.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the\nsurgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately behind, and yet\nwas upon the left side. Now, how can that be unless it were by a left-handed\nman? He had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and\nson. He had even smoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special\nknowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have,\nas you know, devoted some attention to this, and written a little monograph on\nthe ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco.\nHaving found the ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the\nmoss where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which are\nrolled in Rotterdam.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd the cigar-holder?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used a\nholder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not a clean\none, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHolmes,\u201d I said, \u201cyou have drawn a net round this man from\nwhich he cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as\nif you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction in which all\nthis points. The culprit is\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMr. John Turner,\u201d cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our\nsitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.\n\n\nThe man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow, limping step\nand bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude, and yet his hard,\ndeep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed that he was\npossessed of unusual strength of body and of character. His tangled beard,\ngrizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of\ndignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while\nhis lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It\nwas clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic\ndisease.\n\n\n\u201cPray sit down on the sofa,\u201d said Holmes gently. \u201cYou had my\nnote?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see me\nhere to avoid scandal.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd why did you wish to see me?\u201d He looked across at my companion\nwith despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words.\n\u201cIt is so. I know all about McCarthy.\u201d\n\n\nThe old man sank his face in his hands. \u201cGod help me!\u201d he cried.\n\u201cBut I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word\nthat I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am glad to hear you say so,\u201d said Holmes gravely.\n\n\n\u201cI would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would break\nher heart\u2014it will break her heart when she hears that I am\narrested.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt may not come to that,\u201d said Holmes.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who\nrequired my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young McCarthy\nmust be got off, however.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am a dying man,\u201d said old Turner. \u201cI have had diabetes for\nyears. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I\nwould rather die under my own roof than in a gaol.\u201d\n\n\nHolmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of\npaper before him. \u201cJust tell us the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cI shall\njot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it. Then I\ncould produce your confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy. I\npromise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as well,\u201d said the old man; \u201cit\u2019s a\nquestion whether I shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I\nshould wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to\nyou; it has been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.\n\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate.\nI tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he. His grip\nhas been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life. I\u2019ll\ntell you first how I came to be in his power.\n\n\n\u201cIt was in the early \u201960\u2019s at the diggings. I was a young\nchap then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got\namong bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to the\nbush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber.\nThere were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station\nfrom time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings. Black\nJack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party is still remembered\nin the colony as the Ballarat Gang.\n\n\n\u201cOne day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay\nin wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us, so it\nwas a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley.\nThree of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol\nto the head of the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the\nLord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his wicked little\neyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature. We got away with\nthe gold, became wealthy men, and made our way over to England without being\nsuspected. There I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a\nquiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in the\nmarket, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to make up for the\nway in which I had earned it. I married, too, and though my wife died young she\nleft me my dear little Alice. Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed\nto lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I\nturned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was going\nwell when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.\n\n\n\u201cI had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent\nStreet with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.\n\n\n\u201c\u2018Here we are, Jack,\u2019 says he, touching me on the arm;\n\u2018we\u2019ll be as good as a family to you. There\u2019s two of us, me\nand my son, and you can have the keeping of us. If you\ndon\u2019t\u2014it\u2019s a fine, law-abiding country is England, and\nthere\u2019s always a policeman within hail.\u2019\n\n\n\u201cWell, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them off,\nand there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since. There was no\nrest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his\ncunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon\nsaw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he\nwanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without question, land,\nmoney, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I could not give. He asked\nfor Alice.\n\n\n\u201cHis son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known\nto be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step\ninto the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not have his cursed\nstock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was\nin him, and that was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to\ndo his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it\nover.\n\n\n\u201cWhen I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a\ncigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I listened to\nhis talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost. He was\nurging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might\nthink as if she were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that\nI and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this.\nCould I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though\nclear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed.\nBut my memory and my girl! Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul\ntongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned, I\nhave led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl should be\nentangled in the same meshes which held me was more than I could suffer. I\nstruck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and\nvenomous beast. His cry brought back his son; but I had gained the cover of the\nwood, though I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in\nmy flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that occurred.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, it is not for me to judge you,\u201d said Holmes as the old man\nsigned the statement which had been drawn out. \u201cI pray that we may never\nbe exposed to such a temptation.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIn view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will\nsoon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes. I will\nkeep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I shall be forced to use it.\nIf not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be\nalive or dead, shall be safe with us.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFarewell, then,\u201d said the old man solemnly. \u201cYour own\ndeathbeds, when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace\nwhich you have given to mine.\u201d Tottering and shaking in all his giant\nframe, he stumbled slowly from the room.\n\n\n\u201cGod help us!\u201d said Holmes after a long silence. \u201cWhy does\nfate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as\nthis that I do not think of Baxter\u2019s words, and say, \u2018There, but\nfor the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.\u2019\u201d\n\n\nJames McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number of\nobjections which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the defending\ncounsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our interview, but he is now\ndead; and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live\nhappily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past.\n",
